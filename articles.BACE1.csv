11423558,"BACE2 functions as an alternative alpha-secretase in cells.","BACE1 and BACE2 define a new subfamily of membrane-anchored aspartyl proteases. Both endoproteases share similar structural organization including a prodomain, a catalytic domain formed via DTG and DSG active site motifs, a single transmembrane domain, and a short C-terminal tail. BACE1 has been identified as the Alzheimer's beta-secretase, whereas BACE2 was mapped to the Down's critical region of human chromosome 21. Herein we show that purified BACE2 can be autoactivated in vitro. Purified BACE2 cleaves human amyloid precursor protein (APP) sequences at the beta-secretase site, and near the alpha-secretase site, mainly at A beta-Phe(20)--Ala(21) and also at A beta-Phe(19)--Phe(20). Alternatively, in cells BACE2 has a limited effect on the beta-secretase site but efficiently cleaves the sequences near the alpha-secretase site. The in vitro specificity of APP processing by BACE2 is distinct from that observed in cells. BACE2 localizes in the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, trans-Golgi network, endosomes, and plasma membrane, and its cellular localization patterns depend on the presence of its transmembrane domain. BACE2 chimeras that increase localization of BACE2 in the trans-Golgi network do not change its APP processing patterns. Thus, BACE2 can be distinguished from BACE1 on the basis of autoprocessing of the prosegment, APP processing specificity, and subcellular localization patterns.","0021-9258","The Journal of biological chemistry","(276) 34019-27",2001,"R","Yan","R","Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Pharmacia Corporation, Kalamazoo, Michigan 49007, USA. ryan@pharmacia.com"

11466313,"The transmembrane domain of the Alzheimer's beta-secretase (BACE1) determines its late Golgi localization and access to beta -amyloid precursor protein (APP) substrate.","Release of Abeta peptides from beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) requires sequential cleavage by two endopeptidases, beta- and gamma-secretases. beta-Secretase was recently identified as a novel membrane-bound aspartyl protease, named BACE1, Asp2, or memapsin 2. Employing confocal microscopy and subcellular fractionation, we have found that BACE1 is largely situated in the distal Golgi membrane with a minor presence in the endoplasmic reticulum, endosomes, and plasma membrane in human neuroblastoma SHEP cells and in mouse Neuro-2a cell lines expressing either endogenous mouse BACE1 or additional exogenous human BACE1. The major cellular beta-secretase activity is located in the late Golgi apparatus, consistent with its cellular localization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the single transmembrane domain of BACE1 alone determines the retention of BACE1 to the Golgi compartments, through examination of recombinant proteins of various BACE1 fragments fused to a reporter green fluorescence protein. In addition, we show that the transmembrane domain of BACE1 is required for the access of BACE1 enzymatic activity to the cellular APP substrate and hence for the optimal generation of the C-terminal fragment of APP (CTF99). The results suggest a molecular and cell biological mechanism for the regulation of beta-secretase activity in vivo.","0021-9258","The Journal of biological chemistry","(276) 36788-96",2001,"R","Yan","R","Department of Cell & Molecular Biology, Pharmacia Corporation, Kalamazoo, Michigan 49007, USA. ryan@pharmacia.com"
11525745,"Compartmentalization of beta-secretase (Asp2) into low-buoyant density, noncaveolar lipid rafts.","Recent epidemiological studies show a reduced prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) in patients treated with inhibitors of cholesterol biosynthesis. Moreover, the cholesterol-transport protein, apolipoprotein E4, and elevated cholesterol are important risk factors for AD. Additionally, in vitro and in vivo studies show that intracellular cholesterol levels can modulate the processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) to beta-amyloid, the major constituent of senile plaques. Cholesterol plays a crucial role in maintaining lipid rafts in a functional state. Lipid rafts are cholesterol-enriched membrane microdomains implicated in signal transduction, protein trafficking, and proteolytic processing. Since APP, beta-amyloid, and the putative gamma-secretase, presenilin-1 (PS-1), have all been found in lipid rafts, we hypothesized that the recently identified beta-secretase, Asp2 (BACE1), might also be present in rafts. Here, we report that recombinant Asp2 expressed in three distinct cell lines is raft associated. Using both detergent and nondetergent methods, Asp2 protein and activity were found in a light membrane raft fraction that also contained other components of the amyloidogenic pathway. Immunoisolation of caveolin-containing vesicles indicated that Asp2 was present in a unique raft population distinct from caveolae. Finally, depletion of raft cholesterol abrogated association of Asp2 with the light membrane fraction. These observations are consistent with the raft localization of APP processing and suggest that the partitioning of Asp2 into lipid rafts may underlie the cholesterol sensitivity of beta-amyloid production.","0960-9822","Current biology : CB","(11) 1288-93",2001,"D R","Riddell","DR","Neurology Centre of Excellence for Drug Discovery, GlaxoSmithKline, New Frontiers Science Park, Third Avenue, Harlow CM19 5AW, United Kingdom."
11698669,"Alzheimer's beta-secretase, beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme, is responsible for cleavage secretion of a Golgi-resident sialyltransferase.","The deposition of amyloid beta-peptide (A beta) in the brain is closely associated with the development of Alzheimer's disease. A beta is generated from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential action of beta-secretase (BACE1) and gamma-secretase. Although BACE1 is distributed among various other tissues, its physiological substrates other than APP have yet to be identified. ST6Gal I is a sialyltransferase that produces a sialyl alpha 2,6galactose residue, and the enzyme is secreted out of the cell after proteolytic cleavage. We report here that BACE1 is involved in the proteolytic cleavage of ST6Gal I, on the basis of the following observations. ST6Gal I was colocalized with BACE1 in the Golgi apparatus by immunofluorescence microscopy, suggesting that BACE1 acts on ST6Gal I within the same intracellular compartment. When BACE1 was overexpressed with ST6Gal I in COS cells, the secretion of ST6Gal I markedly increased. When APP(SW) (Swedish familial Alzheimer's disease mutation), a preferable substrate for BACE1, was coexpressed with ST6Gal I in COS cells, the secretion of ST6Gal I significantly decreased, suggesting that that the beta-cleavage of overexpressed APP(SW) competes with ST6Gal I processing. In addition, BACE1-Fc (Fc, the hinge and constant region of IgG) chimera cleaved protein A-ST6Gal I fusion protein in vitro. Thus, we conclude that BACE1 is responsible for the cleavage and secretion of ST6Gal I.","0027-8424","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","(98) 13554-9",2001,"S","Kitazume","S","Glyco-chain Functions Laboratory, Supra-biomolecular System Group, Frontier Research System, The Institute of Physical and Chemical Research (RIKEN), 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako-shi, Saitama 351-0198, Japan."

11816789,"The beta-secretase, BACE: a prime drug target for Alzheimer's disease.","Evidence suggests that the beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) is central to the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid plaques, primarily composed of Abeta, progressively develop in the brains of AD patients, and mutations in three genes (APP, PS1, and PS2) cause early onset familial AD (FAD) by directly increasing synthesis of the toxic, plaque-promoting Abeta42 peptide. Given the strong association between Abeta and AD, therapeutic strategies to lower the concentration of Abeta in the brain should prove beneficial for the treatment of AD. One such strategy would involve inhibiting the enzymes that generate Abeta. Abeta is a product of catabolism of the large Typel membrane protein, amyloid precursor protein (APP). Two proteases, called beta- and gamma-secretase, mediate the endoproteolysis of APP to liberate the Abeta peptide. For over a decade, the molecular identities of these proteases were unknown. Recently, the gamma-secretase has been tentatively identified as the presenilin proteins, PS1 and PS2, and the identity of the beta-secretase has been shown to be the novel transmembrane aspartic protease, beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1; also called Asp2 and memapsin2). BACE2, a novel protease homologous to BACE1, was also identified, and together the two enzymes define a new family of transmembrane aspartic proteases. BACE1 exhibits all the properties of the beta-secretase, and as the key rate-limiting enzyme that initiates the formation of Abeta, BACE1 is an attractive drug target for AD. Here, I review the identification and initial characterization of BACE1 and BACE2, and summarize our current understanding of BACE1 post-translational processing and intracellular trafficking. In addition, I discuss recent studies of BACE1 knockout mice and the BACE1 X-ray structure, and relate implications for BACE1 drug development.","0895-8696","Journal of molecular neuroscience : MN","(17) 157-70",2001,"R","Vassar","R","Northwestern University Medical School, Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Chicago, IL 60611, USA. r-vassar@northwestern.edu"

In transfected cells both BACE1A, which encodes the originally described full-length BACE1 protein and the close homolog BACE2 localized mainly to post-Golgi membranes. In contrast, the two shorter isoforms were found in the endoplasmic reticulum only, and they did not display beta-secretase activity.

12391600,"Beta-secretase as a target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.","Finding inhibitors of the first step of the amyloid cascade, A beta (42) generation, is a major goal of Alzheimer's disease drug development. Two target protease activities, beta-and gamma-secretase, were detected more than 10 years ago but progress in this area has been slow because the enzymes were not identified. Using an expression cloning strategy we have identified a novel membrane bound aspartic protease, BACE1, as beta-secretase. The enzyme has been characterized in detail. The X-ray crystal structure, which is critical for rational inhibitor design, has been solved and shown to be similar to that of other pepsin family members. Our recent knockout studies show that BACE1 is critical for A beta generation, but the knockout mice show an otherwise normal phenotype, raising the possibility that therapeutic BACE1 inhibition could be accomplished without major mechanism based toxicity. Target-mediated toxicity of beta-secretase inhibition cannot be ruled out, however, as long as the major substrates of this enzyme are unknown. Although various peptidic beta-secretase inhibitors have been published, the key challenge now is the generation of more drug-like compounds that could be developed for therapeutic purposes. The focus of this review is progress in the beta-secretase field from the identification of the enzyme in 1999 to the most recent publications.","0360-4012","Journal of neuroscience research","(70) 373-9",2002,"Martin","Citron","M","Department of Neuroscience, Amgen Inc, Thousand Oaks, California 91320, USA. mcitron@amgen.com"
12423367,"Enzymic properties of recombinant BACE2.","BACE2 (Memapsin 1) is a membrane-bound aspartic protease that is highly homologous with BACE1 (Memapsin 2). While BACE1 processes the amyloid precursor protein (APP) at a key step in generating the beta-amyloid peptide and presumably causes Alzheimer's disease (AD), BACE2 has not been demonstrated to be directly involved in APP processing, and its physiological functions remain to be determined. In vivo, BACE2 is expressed as a precursor protein containing pre-, pro-, protease, transmembrane, and cytosolic domains/peptides. To determine the enzymatic properties of BACE2, two variants of its pro-protease domain, pro-BACE2-T1 (PB2-T1) and pro-BACE2-T2 (PB2-T2), were constructed. They have been expressed in Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies, refolded and purified. These two recombinant proteins have the same N terminus but differ at their C-terminal ends: PB2-T1 ends at Pro466, on the boundary of the postulated transmembrane domain, and PB2-T2 ends at Ser431, close to the homologous ends of other aspartic proteases such as pepsin. While PB2-T1 shares similar substrate specificities with BACE1 and other 'general' aspartic proteases, the specificity of PB2-T2 is more constrained, apparently preferring to cleave at the NH2-terminal side of paired basic residues. Unlike other 'typical' aspartic proteases, which are active only under acidic conditions, the recombinant BACE2, PB2-T1, was active at a broad pH range.

By BACE1 overexpression in COS cells, the secretion of ST6Gal I markedly increased, and the amino terminus of the secreted ST6Gal I started at Glu(41). Here we report that BACE1-Fc chimera protein cleaved the A-ST6Gal I fusion protein, or ST6Gal I-derived peptide, between Leu(37) and Gln(38), suggesting that an initial cleavage product by BACE1 was three amino acids longer than the secreted ST6Gal I. The three amino acids, Gln(38)-Ala(39)-Lys(40), were found to be truncated by exopeptidase activity, which was detected in detergent extracts of Golgi-derived membrane fraction.

Brain sections were processed for the expression of BACE1 and glial markers by double immunofluorescence labeling and evaluated by confocal laser scanning microscopy. There was no detectable expression of BACE1 protein by activated microglial cells of the ameboid or ramified phenotype in any of the lesion paradigms studied.

APP is cleaved either by beta-secretase or by alpha-secretase to initiate amyloidogenic (release of A beta) or nonamyloidogenic processing of APP, respectively. A key to understanding AD is to unravel how access of these enzymes to APP is regulated. Here, we demonstrate that lipid rafts are critically involved in regulating A beta generation. Reducing cholesterol levels in N2a cells decreased A beta production. APP and the beta-site APP cleavage enzyme (BACE1) could be induced to copatch at the plasma membrane upon cross-linking with antibodies and to segregate away from nonraft markers. Antibody cross-linking dramatically increased production of A beta in a cholesterol-dependent manner. A beta generation was dependent on endocytosis and was reduced after expression of the dynamin mutant K44A and the Rab5 GTPase-activating protein, RN-tre. This inhibition could be overcome by antibody cross-linking. These observations suggest the existence of two APP pools. Although APP inside raft clusters seems to be cleaved by beta-secretase, APP outside rafts undergoes cleavage by alpha-secretase. Thus, access of alpha- and beta-secretase to APP, and therefore A beta generation, may be determined by dynamic interactions of APP with lipid rafts.","0021-9525","The Journal of cell biology","(160) 113-23",2003,"Robert","Ehehalt","R","Max Planck Institute of Molecular Cell Biology and Genetics, D-01307 Dresden, Germany."

Here, we describe work toward understanding the substrate specificity of BACE1 that began by considering the natural APP substrate and its Swedish mutant, APPSw, and proceeded on to include oxidized insulin B chain and ubiquitin substrates. From these findings, and the study of additional synthetic peptides, we determined that a decapeptide derived from APP in which the P3-P2' sequence, ...VKM--DA..., was replaced by ...ISY--EV... (-- = beta site of cleavage), yielded a substrate that was cleaved by BACE1 seven times faster than the corresponding APPSw peptide, SEVNL--DAEFR. The expanded peptide, GLTNIKTEEISEISY--EVEFRWKK, was cleaved an additional seven times faster than its decapeptide counterpart (boldface), and provides a substrate allowing assay of BACE1 at picomolar concentrations. Several APP mutants reflecting these beta-site amino acid changes were prepared as the basis for cellular assays. The APPISYEV mutant proved to be a cellular substrate that was superior to APPSw. The assay based on APPISYEV is highly specific for measuring BACE1 activity in cells; its homolog, BACE2, barely cleaved APPISYEV at the beta-site. Insertion of the optimized ISY--EV motif at either the beta-site (Asp1) or beta'-site (Glu11) directs the rate of cellular processing of APP at these two accessible sites.

In normal human muscle AbetaPP was also shown to be present and presumably playing a role (a) at neuromuscular junctions and (b) during muscle development. To investigate whether BACE1 and BACE2 play a role in normal and diseased human muscle, we have now studied them by immunocytochemistry and immunoblotting in 35 human muscle biopsies, including: 5 s-IBM; 5 chromosome-9p1-linked quadriceps-sparing h-IBM; and 25 control muscle biopsies. In addition, expression of BACE1 and BACE2 was studied in normal cultured human muscle. Our studies demonstrate that BACE1 and BACE2 (a) are expressed in normal adult muscle at the postsynaptic domain of neuromuscular junctions, and in cultured human muscle; (b) are accumulated in the form of plaque-like inclusions in both s-IBM and h-IBM vacuolated muscle fibers; and (c) are immunoreactive in necrotizing muscle fibers.

Here, we analyzed the impact of aberrant ceramide levels on amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) generation by using a cell-permeable analog of ceramide, C6-ceramide, and several biochemical inhibitors of the sphingomyelin/glycosphingolipid biosynthetic pathway. We found that C6-ceramide increased the biogenesis of Abeta by affecting beta-but not gamma-cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein. Similarly to C6-ceramide, increased levels of endogenous ceramide induced by neutral sphingomyelinase treatment also promoted the biogenesis of Abeta. Conversely, fumonisin B1, which inhibits the biosynthesis of endogenous ceramide, reduced Abeta production. Exogenous C6-ceramide restored both intracellular ceramide levels and Abeta generation in fumonisin B1-treated cells. These events were specific for amyloid precursor protein and were not associated with apoptotic cell death. Pulse-chase and time-course degradation experiments showed that ceramide post-translationally stabilizes the beta-secretase BACE1.

Abeta peptides are generated from the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta- and gamma-secretases. Beta-secretase (BACE), a type-I transmembrane aspartyl protease, cleaves APP first to generate a 99-amino acid membrane-associated fragment (CT99) containing the N terminus of Abeta peptides. Gamma-secretase, a multi-protein complex, then cleaves within the transmembrane region of CT99 to generate the C termini of Abeta peptides. The production of Abeta peptides is, therefore, dependent on the activities of both BACE and gamma-secretase. The cleavage of APP by BACE is believed to be a prerequisite for gamma-secretase-mediated processing. In the present study, we provide evidence both in vitro and in cells that BACE-mediated cleavage between amino acid residues 34 and 35 (Abeta-34 site) in the Abeta region is dependent on gamma-secretase activity. In vitro, the Abeta-34 site is processed specifically by BACE1 and BACE2, but not by cathepsin D, a closely related aspartyl protease. Moreover, the cleavage of the Abeta-34 site by BACE1 or BACE2 occurred only when Abeta 1- 40 peptide, a gamma-secretase cleavage product, was used as substrate, not the non-cleaved CT99. In cells, overexpression of BACE1 or BACE2 dramatically increased the production of the Abeta 1-34 species. More importantly, the cellular production of Abeta 1-34 species induced by overexpression of BACE1 or BACE2 was blocked by a number of known gamma-secretase inhibitors in a concentration-dependent manner. These gamma-secretase inhibitors had no effect on enzymatic activity of BACE1 or BACE2 in vitro. Our data thus suggest that gamma-secretase cleavage of CT99 is a prerequisite for BACE-mediated processing at Abeta-34 site. Therefore, BACE and gamma-secretase activity can be mutually dependent.","0021-9258","The Journal of biological chemistry","(278) 21286-94",2003,"Xiao-Ping","Shi","XP","Department of Biological Chemistry, Merck Research Laboratories, West Point, Pennsylvania 19486, USA. xiao-ping_shi@merck.com"
12707937,"Specific BACE1 genotypes provide additional risk for late-onset Alzheimer disease in APOE epsilon 4 carriers.","Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized neuropathologically by neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques. A key component of plaques is A beta, a polypeptide derived from A beta-precursor protein (APP) through proteolytic cleavage catalyzed by beta and gamma-secretase. We hypothesized that sequence variation in genes BACE1 (on chromosome 11q23.3) and BACE2 (on chromosome 21q22.3), which encode two closely related proteases that seem to act as the APP beta-secretase, may represent a genetic risk factor for AD. We analyzed the frequencies of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in BACE1 and BACE2 genes in a community-based sample of 96 individuals with late-onset AD and 170 controls selected randomly among residents of the same community. The genotype data in both study groups did not demonstrate any association between AD and BACE1 or BACE2. After stratification for APOE status, however, an association between a BACE1 polymorphism located within codon V262 and AD in APOE epsilon 4 carriers was observed (P = 0.03). We conclude that sequence variation in the BACE1 or BACE 2 gene is not a significant risk factor for AD; however, a combination of a specific BACE1 allele and APOE epsilon 4 may increase the risk for Alzheimer disease over and above that attributed to APOE epsilon 4 alone.","1552-4841","American journal of medical genetics.

The characterization of the betaAPP-derived catabolites indicates that cells expressing BACEs produce less genuine Abeta1- 40/42 but higher amounts of secreted sAPPbeta and N-terminal-truncated Abeta species. This was accompanied by a concomitant modulation of the C-terminal counterpart products C89 and C79 for BACE1 and BACE2, respectively. These cells were used to set up a novel BACE assay based on two quenched fluorimetric substrates mimicking the wild-type (JMV2235) and Swedish-mutated (JMV2236) betaAPP sequences targeted by BACE activities. We show that BACEs activities are enhanced by the Swedish mutation and maximal at pH 4.5. The specificity of this double assay for genuine beta-secretase activity was demonstrated by means of cathepsin D, a ""false positive"" BACE candidate. Thus, cathepsin D was unable to cleave preferentially the JMV2236-mutated substrate. The selectivity of the assay was also emphasized by the lack of JMV cleavage triggered by other ""secretases"" candidates such as ADAM10 (A disintegrin and metalloprotease 10), tumor necrosis alpha-converting enzyme, and presenilins 1 and 2. Finally, the assay was used to screen for putative in vitro BACE inhibitors.

A second integral membrane aspartyl protease related to BACE1, referred to as beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 2 (BACE2) has also been demonstrated to cleave APP at the beta-cleavage site in transfected cells. The role of endogenous BACE2 in A beta production remains unresolved. We investigated the role of endogenous BACE2 in A beta production in cells by selective inactivation of its transcripts using RNA interference. We are able to reduce steady state levels for mRNA for each enzyme by >85%, and protein amounts by 88-94% in cells. Selective inactivation of BACE1 by RNA interference results in decreased beta-cleaved secreted APP and A beta peptide secretion from cells, as expected. Selective inactivation of BACE2 by RNAi results in increased beta-cleaved secreted APP and A beta peptide secretion from cells. Simultaneous targeting of both enzymes by RNA interference does not have any net effect on A beta released from cells. Our observations of changes in APP metabolism and A beta are consistent with a role of BACE2 in suppressing A beta production in cells that co-express both enzymes.","0021-9258","The Journal of biological chemistry","(278) 31512-20",2003,"Guriqbal","Basi","G","Elan Pharmaceuticals, South San Francisco, California 94080,USA. guriq.basi@elan.cim"

The basal activity of this promoter construct was highest in neuronal cell lines such as BE(2)-C and PC12 and in the pancreatic cell line AR42J, somewhat lower in rat primary neurons, and astrocytic and microglial cultures, very low in hepatocytes, and almost absent in fibroblasts and in the monocyte-macrophage cell line RAW264.7. The first 600 bp of this promoter are highly conserved among rat, mouse, and human, suggesting that this region contains regulatory elements that modulate BACE1 transcription. Indeed, this fragment contains several putative transcription factor binding sites such as MZF1, Sp1, four GATA-1 sites, and one YY1 site. Directed mutagenesis of GATA-1 elements led to altered luciferase expression, indicating that these sites are involved in the regulation of BACE1 transcription.

Several lines of evidence suggest that potent BACE1 inhibitors represent an attractive A beta-lowering strategy for AD. We designed a simple homogeneous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) assay which utilizes the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) pair europium and allophycocyanin for measuring BACE1 enzymatic activity in a high-throughput manner. Robust FRET was observed when an 18-amino-acid APP Swedish-synthetic peptide that was N-terminally labeled with europium cryptate and C-terminally biotinylated was incubated with streptavidin-coupled cross-linked allophycocyanin (SA-XL665). Purified BACE1 enzyme caused a time- and concentration-dependent linear change in FRET at low nanomolar enzyme concentrations. This assay was used to compare the autoprocessed ""mature"" BACE1 enzyme (sautoBACe1) and the soluble proBACE1 for activity and inhibition by selected peptidic BACE inhibitors. sautoBACE1 displayed only a modest increase in activity compared to sproBACE1 and this activity was uninhibited by the BACE1 prodomain peptide. Interestingly, the BACE1 prodomain peptide was able to partially inhibit sproBACE1 activity. IC(50s) for a P10-P4' statine BACE1 inhibitor, OM99-2, and OM-003 determined using the HTRF assay were in good agreement with those reported in the literature.

Here we confirm that the ectodomain of BACE1 is secreted from cells and that this processing is up-regulated by agents that activate protein kinase C. A metalloproteinase is involved in the cleavage of BACE1 as hydroxamic acid-based metalloproteinase inhibitors abolish the release of shed BACE1. Using potent and selective inhibitors, we demonstrate that ADAM10 is a strong candidate for the BACE1 sheddase.

Western blot analysis reveals increased levels of T668-phosphorylated APP COOH-terminal fragments in hippocampal lysates from many AD but not control subjects. Importantly, P-APP cofractionates with endosome markers and BACE1 in an iodixanol gradient and displays extensive colocalization with BACE1 in rat primary cortical neurons. Furthermore, APP COOH-terminal fragments generated by BACE1 are preferentially phosphorylated on T668 verses those produced by alpha-secretase. The production of Abeta is significantly reduced when phosphorylation of T668 is either abolished by mutation or inhibited by T668 kinase inhibitors.

Missense mutations in PS1 (and PS2) occur in patients with early-onset familial AD (FAD), and previous studies in transgenic mice and cultured cell models demonstrated that FAD-PS1 variants shift the ratio of Abeta40 : 42 to favor Abeta42. One hypothesis to explain this outcome is that mutant PS alters the specificity of gamma-secretase to favor production of Abeta42 at the expense of Abeta40. To test this hypothesis in vivo, we studied Abeta40 and 42 levels in a series of transgenic mice that co-express the Swedish mutation of APP (APPswe) with two FAD-PS1 variants that differentially accelerate amyloid pathology in the brain. We demonstrate a direct correlation between the concentration of Abeta42 and the rate of amyloid deposition. We further show that the shift in Abeta42 : 40 ratios associated with the expression of FAD-PS1 variants is due to a specific elevation in the steady-state levels of Abeta42, while maintaining a constant level of Abeta40. These data suggest that PS1 variants do not simply alter the preferred cleavage site for gamma-secretase, but rather that they have more complex effects on the regulation of gamma-secretase and its access to substrates.","0964-6906","Human molecular genetics","(13) 159-70",2004,"Joanna L","Jankowsky","JL","Department of Pathology, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA."

The region of bp -619 to +46 is the minimal promoter to control the transcription of the BACE1 gene. Several putative cis-acting elements, such as a GC box, HSF-1, a PU box, AP1, AP2, and lymphokine response element, are found in the 5' flanking region of the BACE1 gene. Transcriptional activation and gel shift assays demonstrated that the BACE1 promoter contains a functional Sp1 response element, and overexpression of the transcription factor Sp1 potentiates BACE gene expression and APP processing to generate Abeta. Furthermore, Sp1 knockout reduced BACE1 expression. These results suggest that BACE1 gene expression is tightly regulated at the transcriptional level and that the transcription factor Sp1 plays an important role in regulation of BACE1 to process APP generating Abeta in Alzheimer's disease.","0270-7306","Molecular and cellular biology","(24) 865-74",2004,"Michelle A","Christensen","MA","Department of Psychiatry, Brain Research Center, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia V6T 1Z3, Canada."

BACE1 knockout mice lack Abeta and are phenotypically normal, suggesting that therapeutic inhibition of BACE1 may be free of mechanism-based side effects. However, direct evidence that BACE1 inhibition would improve cognition is lacking. Here we show that BACE1 null mice engineered to overexpress human APP (BACE1(-/-).Tg2576(+)) are rescued from Abeta-dependent hippocampal memory deficits. Moreover, impaired hippocampal cholinergic regulation of neuronal excitability found in the Tg2576 AD model is ameliorated in BACE1(-/-).Tg2576(+) bigenic mice. The behavioral and electrophysiological rescue of deficits in BACE1(-/-).Tg2576(+) mice is correlated with a dramatic reduction of cerebral Abeta40 and Abeta42 levels and occurs before amyloid deposition in Tg2576 mice. Our gene-based approach demonstrates that lower Abeta levels are beneficial for AD-associated memory impairments, validating BACE1 as a therapeutic target for AD.","0896-6273","Neuron","(41) 27-33",2004,"Masuo","Ohno","M","Department of Physiology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, IL 60611, USA. ohno@northwestern.edu"

The enhanced production of this enzyme occurs without corresponding changes in BACE1 mRNA levels. The complex 5' leader of BACE1 mRNA contains three upstream ORFs (uORFs) preceding the BACE1 initiation codon. In this study, we investigated how this 5' leader affects translation efficiency as a first step in understanding the enhanced production of the enzyme in the disease. Using reporter constructs in transfected mammalian cell lines and cell-free lysates, we showed that the translation mediated by the BACE1 5' leader is cap-dependent and inhibited by cis-acting segments contained within the 5' leader. Disruption of the uORFs had no effect on translation in B104 cells, which was surprising because the first two AUGs reside in contexts able to function as initiation codons. Possible mechanisms to explain how ribosomes bypass the uORFs, including reinitiation, leaky scanning, and internal initiation of translation were found to be inconsistent with the data. The data are most consistent with a model in which ribosomes shunt uORF-containing segments of the 5' leader as the ribosomes move from the 5' end of the mRNA to the initiation codon. In PC12 cells, however, the second uORF appears to be translated. We hypothesize that the translation efficiency of the BACE1 initiation codon may be increased in patients with Alzheimer's disease by molecular mechanisms that enhance shunting or increase the relative accessibility the BACE1 initiation codon.","0027-8424","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","(101) 2794-9",2004,"George W","Rogers","GW","Department of Neurobiology and The Skaggs Institute for Chemical Biology, The Scripps Research Institute, 10550 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA."

Abeta is derived from the Abeta peptide precursor protein (APP) by gamma- and beta-secretases, the latter known as beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1, or herein BACE). We have also described potentially important regions in the promoter of BACE, which may regulate its activity (1). Herein, we have functionally dissected the regulatory regions within the BACE promoter into areas containing positive and negative regulatory elements. The 4.1 kb promoter region (-3765/+364, +1 being the transcription start site [TSS]) includes positive regulatory element in the -2975 to -2062 region flanked on either side by negative regulatory elements at -3764/-2975 and -2062/-1056. This is separated from the minimal promoter and 5' UTR by a neutral region of roughly 700 base pairs (bp). A 91 bp fragment (224/314) is the shortest region with a significant reporter gene activity and constitutes the minimal promoter element for BACE. Neuronal preference of the promoter was apparent in the 141 bp fragment (224/364) that contained the 91 bp fragment. Gel shift results also suggest the strongest signal of DNA-protein interaction with the 91 bp fragment in neuronal nuclear extracts. This interaction was strongly blocked by an activator protein (AP)2 binding oligomer. Super gel shift assays suggest that both the AP2-binding oligomer and the 91 bp fragment interfered with each other's binding capacity. An AP2 sequence is predicted to occur within the 91 bp fragment. We also found stimulating protein (SP)1-binding sites in this region of the promoter. Thus, functional and gel shift analysis indicate that the 91 bp fragment containing the AP2 and SP1 binding sites constitutes the core promoter region of BACE. Changes in the activity of this region could play an important role in regulating BACE activity in neurons.","1530-6860","FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology","(18) 1037-9",2004,"Yuan-Wen","Ge","YW","Department of Psychiatry, Institute of Psychiatric Research, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA."

15126696,"BACE1: the beta-secretase enzyme in Alzheimer's disease.","Data that have accumulated for well over a decade have implicated the beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide as a central player in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid plaques, composed primarily of Abeta progressively form in the brains of AD patients, and mutations in three genes (amyloid precursor protein [APP] and presenilin 1 and 2 [PS1 and PS2]) cause early-onset familial AD (FAD) by directly increasing production of the toxic, plaque-promoting Abeta42 peptide. Given the strong association between Abeta and AD, it is likely that therapeutic strategies to lower the levels of Abeta in the brain should prove beneficial for the treatment of AD. One such strategy could involve inhibiting the enzymes that generate Abeta. Abeta is a product of catabolism of the large type-I membrane protein APP. Two proteases, called beta- and gamma-secretase, endoproteolyze APP to liberate the Abeta peptide. Recently, the molecules responsible for these proteolytic activities have been identified. Several lines of evidence suggest that the PS1 and PS2 proteins are gamma-secretase, and the identity of beta-secretase has been shown to be the novel transmembrane aspartic protease, beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1; also called Asp2 and memapsin 2). BACE2, a protease homologous to BACE1, was also identified, and together the two enzymes define a new family of transmembrane aspartic proteases. BACE1 exhibits all the functional properties of beta-secretase, and as the key enzyme that initiates the formation of Abeta, BACE1 is an attractive drug target for AD.

This method can also be used to derive an approximate value, or a lower limit, for the dissociation constant of the potential ligand based on the reduction of the signal intensity of the STD indicator, which is illustrated on an HSA (human serum albumin) model system. This leads to important applications of the competition STD NMR method for lead discovery: it can be used (i) for compound library screening against a broad range of drug targets to identify both high- and low-affinity ligands and (ii) to rank order analogs rapidly and derive structure-activity relationships, which are used to optimize these NMR hits into viable drug leads.","0749-1581","Magnetic resonance in chemistry : MRC","(42) 485-9",2004,"Yu-Sen","Wang","YS","Schering-Plough Research Institute, 2015 Galloping Hill Road, Kenilworth, New Jersey 07033, USA. allen.yu-sen.wang@spcorp.com"

In the presence of the 5'UTR, we observed more than 90% reduction of BACE1 protein levels in HEK293, COS7 and H4 cells, and a similar reduction of BACE1 activity in vitro. mRNA levels were not affected, demonstrating that the 5'UTR repressed the translation but not the transcription of BACE1. The 3'UTR did not affect BACE1 expression. An extensive mutagenesis analysis predicts that the GC-rich region of the 5'UTR forms a constitutive translation barrier, which may prevent the ribosome from efficiently translating the BACE1 mRNA. Our data therefore demonstrate translational repression as a new mechanism controlling BACE1 expression.","1469-221X","EMBO reports","(5) 620-5",2004,"Sven","Lammich","S","Department of Biochemistry, Laboratory for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease Research, Adolf Butenandt Institute, Ludwig Maximilians University, Schillerstrasse 44, 80336 Munich, Germany."

The present study sought to determine whether BACE1 expression is controlled by muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (mAChR) subtypes in the neuroblastoma cell line SK-SH-SY5Y. Stimulation of cells with the M1/M3-selective mAChR agonist talsaclidine for 1 hr resulted in a dose-dependent increase in BACE1 expression up to twofold over basal levels. Similar effects of BACE1 up-regulation were observed when protein kinase C was directly activated by phorbol esters. However, when the MAP kinases MEK/ERK were inhibited, BACE1 expression was no longer up-regulated by the activation of M1-mAChR. In contrast, BACE1 expression was suppressed by stimulation of M2-mediated pathways via selective M2-agonist binding or direct activation of adenylate cyclase with forskolin, an effect that was prevented by inhibiting protein kinase A. These results may explain the observed deterioration of AD patients after initial improvements with AChE inhibitor or M1-mAChR agonist treatment.","0360-4012","Journal of neuroscience research","(77) 250-7",2004,"Thole","Züchner","T","Paul Flechsig Institute for Brain Research, Department of Neurochemistry, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany."

The significance underlying Abeta-(11-40/42) in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis has remained to be experimentally elucidated, but increased production of Abeta-(1-40/42) has been broadly demonstrated to contribute to amyloid depositions in senile plaques. In this study, we show that the cleavage of APP at the beta-site by BACE1 is readily disrupted through limited structural twists, whereas the beta'-site is relatively better positioned to gain access to the BACE1 catalytic cavity. Radical insertion or deletion of residues between beta- and beta'-site also favors cleavage of APP at the beta'-site. On the other hand, either lengthening or shortening the loop region of BACE1 has a minor impact on the selective cleavage of APP at these two adjacent sites, but significantly shortening the loop region impairs the ability of BACE1 to process APP at both sites. Thus, processing of APP by BACE1 is clearly dependent on a mutual structural compatibility in addition to the sequence feature. The knowledge gained from this study will potentially offer an opportunity for rational design of small molecule drugs to block the cleavage of APP specifically at the beta-site while not disturbing the functions of other cellular aspartyl proteases.","0021-9258","The Journal of biological chemistry","(279) 39010-6",2004,"Isam","Qahwash","I","Cell and Molecular Biology, Protein Sciences, Pharmacia Corporation, Kalamazoo, Michigan 49007, USA."

Here we show that reticulon family members are binding partners of BACE1. In brain, BACE1 mainly colocalizes with RTN3 in neurons, whereas RTN4 is more enriched in oligodendrocytes. An increase in the expression of any reticulon protein substantially reduces the production of Abeta. Conversely, lowering the expression of RTN3 by RNA interference increases the secretion of Abeta, suggesting that reticulon proteins are negative modulators of BACE1 in cells. Our data support a mechanism by which reticulon proteins block access of BACE1 to amyloid precursor protein and reduce the cleavage of this protein.

There is growing evidence that cholesterol- and sphingolipid-rich membrane microdomains are involved in regulating trafficking and processing of APP. BACE1, the major beta-secretase in neurons is a palmitoylated transmembrane protein that resides in lipid rafts. A subset of APP is subject to amyloidogenic processing by BACE1 in lipid rafts, and this process depends on the integrity of lipid rafts. Here we describe the association of all four components of the gamma-secretase complex, namely presenilin 1 (PS1)-derived fragments, mature nicastrin, APH-1, and PEN-2, with cholesterol-rich detergent insoluble membrane (DIM) domains of non-neuronal cells and neurons that fulfill the criteria of lipid rafts. In PS1(-/-)/PS2(-/-) and NCT(-/-) fibroblasts, gamma-secretase components that still remain fail to become detergent-resistant, suggesting that raft association requires gamma-secretase complex assembly. Biochemical evidence shows that subunits of the gamma-secretase complex and three TGN/endosome-resident SNAREs cofractionate in sucrose density gradients, and show similar solubility or insolubility characteristics in distinct non-ionic and zwitterionic detergents, indicative of their co-residence in membrane microdomains with similar protein-lipid composition. This notion is confirmed using magnetic immunoisolation of PS1- or syntaxin 6-positive membrane patches from a mixture of membranes with similar buoyant densities following Lubrol WX extraction or sonication, and gradient centrifugation. These findings are consistent with the localization of gamma-secretase in lipid raft microdomains of post-Golgi and endosomes, organelles previously implicated in amyloidogenic processing of APP.","0021-9258","The Journal of biological chemistry","(279) 44945-54",2004,"Kulandaivelu S","Vetrivel","KS","Department of Neurobiology, Pharmacology and Physiology, The University of Chicago, Illinois 60637, USA."

To investigate the role of BACE1 in ST6Gal I secretion in vivo, we analyzed the levels of BACE1 mRNA in the liver, as well as the plasma levels of ST6Gal I, in a hepatopathological model, i.e. Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rats. This rat is a mutant that spontaneously accumulates copper in the liver and incurs hepatic damage. LEC rats exhibited simultaneous increases in BACE1 mRNA in the liver and in the E41 form of the ST6Gal I protein, the BACE1 product, in plasma as early as 6 weeks of age, again suggesting that BACE1 cleaves ST6Gal I in vivo and controls the secretion of the E41 form.","0021-9258","The Journal of biological chemistry","(280) 8589-95",2005,"Shinobu","Kitazume","S","Glyco-chain Functions Laboratory, The Institute of Physical and Chemical Research, RIKEN, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako-shi, Saitama 351-0198, Japan."

Identification of the primary beta-secretase gene, BACE1, provides a unique opportunity to examine the role this unique aspartyl protease plays in altering Abeta metabolism and deposition that occurs in AD. The current experiments seek to examine how modulating beta-secretase expression and activity alters APP processing and Abeta metabolism in vivo. Genomic-based BACE1 transgenic mice were generated that overexpress human BACE1 mRNA and protein. The highest expressing BACE1 transgenic line was mated to transgenic mice containing human APP transgenes. Our biochemical and histochemical studies demonstrate that mice overexpressing both BACE1 and APP show specific alterations in APP processing and age-dependent Abeta deposition. We observed elevated levels of Abeta isoforms as well as significant increases of Abeta deposits in these double transgenic animals. In particular, the double transgenics exhibited a unique cortical deposition profile, which is consistent with a significant increase of BACE1 expression in the cortex relative to other brain regions. Elevated BACE1 expression coupled with increased deposition provides functional evidence for beta-secretase as a primary effector in regional amyloid deposition in the AD brain. Our studies demonstrate, for the first time, that modulation of BACE1 activity may play a significant role in AD pathogenesis in vivo.","0021-9258","The Journal of biological chemistry","(279) 52535-42",2004,"Matthew J","Chiocco","MJ","Department of Genetics, Case Western Reserve University and University Hospitals of Cleveland, Cleveland, Ohio 44106, USA."
15465276,"New players in old amyloid precursor protein-processing pathways.","The amyloid precursor protein (APP) gives rise to beta-amyloid peptides, which are the main constituents of senile plaques in brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. The generation of beta-amyloid peptides requires the enzymatic activity of the beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1). BACE1 is primarily expressed by neurons and increased BACE1 protein concentrations and enzymatic activities have been reported in the brains of AD patients. However, there is accumulating evidence that, in addition to neurons, reactive astrocytes are capable of expressing BACE1 and, therefore, may contribute to beta-amyloid plaque formation. This suggests that conditions accompanied by chronic astrocyte activation may contribute to developing AD. Non-amyloidogenic processing of the APP can be stimulated by phorbol esters (PEs) and by intracellular diacylglycerol (DAG) generation. This led to the hypothesis that classical and novel protein kinase Cs (PKCs), which are activated by DAG/PEs, regulate APP processing. However, in addition to PKCs, there are other DAG/PE receptors present in neurons which may participate in the modulation of APP processing. Munc13-1, a presynaptic protein with an essential role in synaptic vesicle priming, represents such an alternative target of the DAG second messenger pathway. Using Munc13-1 knock-out mice and human neuroblastoma cells transfected with wild-type and mutant Munc13-1 constructs it was demonstrated that Munc13-1 acts independently of and in parallel with PKC to modulate APP metabolism. Therefore, agonists specific for the Munc13-1 C1-domain or small molecules mimicking the function of the endogenous Munc13-1 activator RIM1 may prove useful to shift APP processing towards the non-amyloidogenic pathway.","0736-5748","International journal of developmental neuroscience : the official journal of the International Society for Developmental Neuroscience","(22) 467-74",2004,"Steffen","Rossner","S","Department of Neurochemistry, Paul Flechsig Institute for Brain Research, University of Leipzig, Janhnallee 59, 04109 Leipzig, Germany. rossn@medizin.uni-leipzig.de"

To reveal whether aging-associated increases in brain oxidative stress and inflammation may trigger onset or progression of beta-amyloid deposition, a transgenic mouse (Tg2576) that express the Swedish double mutation of human amyloid precursor protein (APP) was used as animal model to study the developmental pattern of markers of oxidative stress and APP processing. In Tg2576 mouse brain, cortical levels of soluble beta-amyloid (1-40) and (1-42) steadily increased with age, but significant deposition of fibrillary beta-amyloid in cortical areas did not occur before postnatal age of 10 months. The slope of increase in cerebral cortical beta-secretase (BACE1) activities in Tg2576 mice between ages of 9 and 13 months was significantly higher as compared to that of the alpha-secretase, while the expression level of BACE1 protein and mRNA did not change with age. The activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase in cortical tissue from Tg2576 mice steadily increased from postnatal age 9-12 months. The levels of cortical nitric oxide, and reactive nitrogen species demonstrated peak values around 9 months of age, while the level of interleukin-1beta steadily increased from postnatal month 13 onwards. The developmental temporal coincidence of increased levels of reactive nitrogen species and antioxidative enzymes with the onset of beta-amyloid plaque deposition provides further evidence that developmentally and aging-induced alterations in brain oxidative status exhibit a major factor in triggering enhanced production and deposition of beta-amyloid, and potentially predispose to Alzheimer's disease.","0736-5748","International journal of developmental neuroscience : the official journal of the International Society for Developmental Neuroscience","(22) 475-84",2004,"Jenny","Apelt","J","Department of Neurochemistry, University of Leipzig, Paul Flechsig Institute for Brain Research, Jahnallee 59, D-04109 Leipzig, Germany."

Here we report that, when the protein A-ST6Gal I fusion protein, or ST6Gal I-derived peptide, was used as an in vitro substrate for BACE1, it cleaved the substrates between Leu(37) and Gln(38). However, a soluble form of ST6Gal I secreted from COS cells started from Glu(41), which was three amino acids shorter than the in vitro product. The results suggested that the BACE1 product was truncated by an aminopeptidase(s) before secretion. The aminopeptidase activity was successfully detected in detergent extracts of Golgi-membrane fraction.

The lack of Abeta production in beta-APP cleaving enzyme (BACE1)(-/-) mice suggests that BACE1 is the principal beta-secretase in mammalian neurons. Transfection of human APP and BACE1 into neurons derived from wild-type and BACE1(-/-) mice supports cleavage of APP at the canonical beta-secretase site. However, these studies also revealed an alternative BACE1 cleavage site in APP, designated as beta', resulting in Abeta peptides starting at Glu11. The apparent inability of human BACE1 to make this beta'-cleavage in murine APP, and vice versa, led to the hypothesis that this alternative cleavage was species-specific. In contrast, the results from human BACE1 transgenic mice demonstrated that the human BACE1 is able to cleave the endogenous murine APP at the beta'-cleavage site. To address this discrepancy, we designed fluorescent resonance energy transfer peptide substrates containing the beta- and beta'-cleavage sites within human and murine APP to compare: (i) the enzymatic efficiency; (ii) binding kinetics of a BACE1 active site inhibitor LY2039911; and (iii) the pharmacological profiles for human and murine recombinant BACE1. Both BACE1 orthologs were able to cleave APP at the beta- and beta'-sites, although with different efficiencies. Moreover, the inhibitory potency of LY2039911 toward recombinant human and native BACE1 from mouse or guinea pig was indistinguishable. In summary, we have demonstrated, for the first time, that recombinant BACE1 can recognize and cleave APP peptide substrates at the postulated beta'-cleavage site. It does not appear to be a significant species specificity to this cleavage.","0022-3042","Journal of neurochemistry","(91) 1249-59",2004,"Hsiu-Chiung","Yang","HC","Lilly Research Laboratories, Eli Lilly and Company, Indianapolis, Indiana 46285, USA.

Yet, the physiological function of APP is unclear, although it is well documented that APP's proteolytic processing, through the formation of membrane-bound C-terminal fragments (CTFs) and of beta-amyloid peptides, likely influences the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). There is evidence that BACE1 is the enzyme responsible for beta-site cleavage of the APP and for the generation of CTFs. BACE1 expression is upregulated in AD brain, and we have recently shown in human brain and in vitro that BACE product CTFs, when phosphorylated in tyrosine residues, interact with the adaptor proteins ShcA and Grb2, which usually are involved in signal transduction pathways. We investigated the interaction between ShcA, APP, and CTFs in the H4 human cell line that overexpresses BACE1 to clarify the significance of such interactions in vitro and for AD generation. Our result show that the APP, CTF, and ShcA interaction is induced only upon overexpression of BACE1 either transiently or in stable cell lines. In particular, although BACE1 drives the formation of C99 and C89 CTFs, only C99 interacts with the ShcA adaptor protein.

The expression of this enzyme has been localized to the brain, in particular to neurons, indicating that neurons are the major source of beta-amyloid peptides in brain. Astrocytes, on the contrary, are known to be important for beta-amyloid clearance and degradation, for providing trophic support to neurons, and for forming a protective barrier between beta-amyloid deposits and neurons. However, under certain conditions related to chronic stress, the role of astrocytes may not be beneficial. Here we present evidence demonstrating that astrocytes are an alternative source of BACE1 and therefore may contribute to beta-amyloid plaque formation. While resting astroyctes in brain do not express BACE1 at detectable levels, cultured astrocytes display BACE1 promoter activity and express BACE1 mRNA and enzymatically active BACE1 protein. Additionally, in animal models of chronic gliosis and in brains of AD patients, there is BACE1 expression in reactive astrocytes. This would suggest that the mechanism for astrocyte activation plays a role in the development of AD and that therapeutic strategies that target astrocyte activation in brain may be beneficial for the treatment of AD. Also, there are differences in responses to chronic versus acute stress, suggesting that one consequence of chronic stress is an incremental shift to different phenotypic cellular states.","0022-3042","Journal of neurochemistry","(92) 226-34",2005,"Steffen","Rossner","S","Paul Flechsig Institute for Brain Research, Department of Neurochemistry, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany. rossn@medizin.uni-leipzig.de"

Abeta is produced when amyloid precursor protein (APP) is cleaved by beta- and gamma-secretases at the N and C termini of the Abeta domain, respectively. The beta-secretase is membrane-bound aspartyl protease, most commonly known as BACE1. Because BACE1 cleaves APP at the N terminus of the Abeta domain, it catalyzes the first step in Abeta generation. PAR-4 (prostate apoptosis response-4) is a leucine zipper protein that was initially identified to be associated with neuronal degeneration and aberrant Abeta production in models of AD. We now report that the C-terminal domain of PAR-4 is necessary for forming a complex with the cytosolic tail of BACE1 in co-immunoprecipitation assays and in vitro pull-down experiments. Overexpression of PAR-4 significantly increased, whereas silencing of PAR-4 expression by RNA interference significantly decreased, beta-secretase cleavage of APP. These results suggest that PAR-4 may be directly involved in regulating the APP cleavage activity of BACE1. Because the increased BACE1 activity observed in AD patients does not seem to arise from genetic mutations or polymorphisms in BACE1, the identification of PAR-4 as an endogenous regulator of BACE1 activity may have significant implications for developing novel therapeutic strategies for AD.","0021-9258","The Journal of biological chemistry","(280) 13824-32",2005,"Jun","Xie","J","Department of Physiology, University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73104, USA."

We show that ibuprofen reduced Abeta brain levels in rats from exogenously infused Abeta in the absence of altered Abeta production. To determine whether ibuprofen inhibits pro-amyloidogenic factors, APPsw (Tg2576) mice were treated with ibuprofen for 6 months, and expression levels of the Abeta and inflammation-related molecules alpha1 antichymotrypsin (ACT), apoE, BACE1, and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) (PPARgamma) were measured. Among these, ACT, a factor whose overexpression accelerates amyloid pathology, was reduced by ibuprofen both in vivo and in vitro. IL-1beta, which was reduced in our animals by ibuprofen, induced mouse ACT in vitro. While some NSAIDs may inhibit Abeta42 production, these observations suggest that ibuprofen reduction of Abeta pathology may not be mediated by altered Abeta42 production.

A large body of evidence suggests Abeta is central to the pathophysiology of AD and is likely to start this intractable neurodegenerative disorder. Mutations in three genes (amyloid precursor protein/APP, presenilin1, presenilin2) cause early on-set familial AD by increasing synthesis of the toxic 42 amino acid species of Abeta (Abeta42). Fibrillar Abeta in amyloid plaques appears to cause neurodegeneration, although recent studies suggest soluble Abeta oligomers may also be neurotoxic. Regardless, given the strong correlation between Abeta and AD, therapeutic strategies to lower cerebral Abeta levels should prove beneficial for the treatment of AD. Abeta is derived from APP via cleavage by two proteases, beta- and gamma-secretase. beta-secretase, recently identified as the novel aspartic protease BACEI, initiates the formation of Abeta. Consequently, BACE1 in principle is an excellent therapeutic target for strategies to reduce the production of Abeta in AD. However, the discovery of the homologue BACE2 raised the question of whether it too may be a beta-secretase. To settle this issue, our group and others have used gene targeting to generate BACE1 deficient (knockout) mice. These BACEI knockout mice have been instrumental in validating BACEI as the authentic beta-secretase in vivo.

15784960,"Genetic association of BACE1 gene polymorphism C786G with late-onset Alzheimer's disease in Chinese.","Beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides are derived from the endoproteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and play a key role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 ([BACE1] also known as beta-secretase) is responsible for cleaving APP to generate neurotoxic Abeta peptides in patients with AD. The BACE1 gene is located on chromosome 11q23.3, near the recently identified region with increased lod scores for AD. The biological functional and genetic association studies indicated that the BACE1 gene might be a genetic risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). To investigate an association between the BACE1 C786G polymorphism and sporadic LOAD in Chinese, we examined 105 LOAD patients and 130 healthy controls. Our results showed higher frequency of the 786G-allele in LOAD patients (38.6%) than that in controls (28.5%), and a statistical significance was observed for an association of the G-allele with LOAD (odds ratio [OR] = 1.58, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.07-2.23, p = 0.02). We also found a synergetic interaction between the G-allele and apolipoprotein E allele 4 (APOE e4) status on the risk of LOAD (OR = 1.91, 95% CI 1.23-2.95, p = 0.003).

DHA levels are lower in serum and brains of AD patients, which could result from low dietary intake and/or PUFA oxidation. Because effects of DHA on Alzheimer pathogenesis, particularly on amyloidosis, are unknown, we used the APPsw (Tg2576) transgenic mouse model to evaluate the impact of dietary DHA on amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and amyloid burden. Aged animals (17-19 months old) were placed in one of three groups until 22.5 months of age: control (0.09% DHA), low-DHA (0%), or high-DHA (0.6%) chow. beta-Amyloid (Abeta) ELISA of the detergent-insoluble extract of cortical homogenates showed that DHA-enriched diets significantly reduced total Abeta by >70% when compared with low-DHA or control chow diets. Dietary DHA also decreased Abeta42 levels below those seen with control chow. Image analysis of brain sections with an antibody against Abeta (amino acids 1-13) revealed that overall plaque burden was significantly reduced by 40.3%, with the largest reductions (40-50%) in the hippocampus and parietal cortex. DHA modulated APP processing by decreasing both alpha- and beta-APP C-terminal fragment products and full-length APP. BACE1 (beta-secretase activity of the beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme), ApoE (apolipoprotein E), and transthyretin gene expression were unchanged with the high-DHA diet. Together, these results suggest that dietary DHA could be protective against beta-amyloid production, accumulation, and potential downstream toxicity.","1529-2401","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","(25) 3032-40",2005,"Giselle P","Lim","GP","Department of Medicine, University of California Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California 90095, USA."

We previously found that BACE1 also cleaves a glycosyltransferase, alpha2,6-sialyltransferase, as a physiological substrate. In the present study, we performed a BLAST homology search, identified two Drosophila aspartic proteases that are homologous to human BACE1, and isolated their cDNAs. The proteins encoded by the cDNAs were designated as DASP1 and DASP2, which exhibited 59% and 50% similarity to human BACE1, respectively. Each protein contained a pair of active site motifs (Asp/Thr or Ser/Gly), which is a common characteristic of aspartic proteases including BACE1. Although DASP1 and DASP2 did not contain an apparent transmenbrane domain, the proteases overexpressed in COS cells were localized in the Golgi area. Some of the DASP1 overexpressed in S2 cells was secreted, but none of the DASP2 was. DASP1 transcripts were expressed in the head of fruitflies, whereas DASP2 transcripts were mainly expressed in the body. When either DASP1 or DASP2 was coexpressed together with a Golgi-resident transferase, Drosophila heparan sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase, the protease enhanced the secretion of the transferase from the cells, indicating that both DASP1 and DASP2 can induce the secretion of the 6-O-sulfotransferase.","0021-924X","Journal of biochemistry","(137) 315-22",2005,"Norihiro","Kotani","N","Glyco-chain Functions Laboratory, Frontier Research System, The Institute of Physical and Chemical Research, RIKEN, Wako, Saitama 351-0198."
15817521,"Acute treatment with the PPARgamma agonist pioglitazone and ibuprofen reduces glial inflammation and Abeta1-42 levels in APPV717I transgenic mice.","Neuritic plaques in the brain of Alzheimer's disease patients are characterized by beta-amyloid deposits associated with a glia-mediated inflammatory response. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) therapy reduces Alzheimer's disease risk and ameliorates microglial reactivity in Alzheimer's disease brains; however, the molecular mechanisms subserving this effect are not yet clear. Since several NSAIDs bind to and activate the nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma) which acts to inhibit the expression of proinflammatory genes, this receptor appears a good candidate to mediate the observed anti-inflammatory effects. Recent data in vitro suggested that NSAIDs negatively regulate microglial activation and immunostimulated amyloid precursor protein processing via PPARgamma activation. We report that an acute 7 day oral treatment of 10-month-old APPV717I mice with the PPARgamma agonist pioglitazone or the NSAID ibuprofen resulted in a reduction in the number of activated microglia and reactive astrocytes in the hippocampus and cortex. Drug treatment reduced the expression of the proinflammatory enzymes cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). In parallel to the suppression of inflammatory markers, pioglitazone and ibuprofen treatment decreased beta-secretase-1 (BACE1) mRNA and protein levels. Importantly, we observed a significant reduction of the total area and staining intensity of Abeta1-42-positive amyloid deposits in the hippocampus and cortex. Additionally, animals treated with pioglitazone revealed a 27% reduction in the levels of soluble Abeta1-42 peptide. These findings demonstrate that anti-inflammatory drugs can act rapidly to inhibit inflammatory responses in the brain and negatively modulate amyloidogenesis.","1460-2156","Brain : a journal of neurology","(128) 1442-53",2005,"Michael T","Heneka","MT","Department of Neurology, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany. heneka@uni-muenster.de"

Much has been discovered on the properties of these proteases; however, regulatory mechanisms of enzyme-substrate interaction in neurons and their involvement in pathological changes are still not fully understood. It is mainly because of the membrane-associated cleavage of these proteases and the lack of information on new substrates processed in a similar way to APP. Here, using RNA interference-mediated BACE1 knockdown, mouse embryonic fibroblasts that are deficient in either BACE1 or presenilins, and BACE1-deficient mouse brain, we show clear evidence that beta subunits of voltage-gated sodium channels are sequentially processed by BACE1 and gamma-secretase.

Deficiency of cathepsin-E is associated with the development of atopic dermatitis, a pruritic inflammatory skin disease, which has put us to face a high selectivity challenge in the development of drugs for the therapy of Alzheimer's disease or breast cancer. This is because BACE1 (also known as beta-secretase) and cathepsin-D, both belonging to the family of aspartic proteinases, might interact with the same compound as cathepsin-E does. BACE1 is a putative prime therapeutic target for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, and cathepsin-D a potential target for breast cancer. Accordingly, in the course of finding drugs against Alzheimer's disease or breast cancer by inhibiting BACE1 or cathepsin-D, the desired drugs should selectively inhibit only BACE1 or cathepsin-D, but definitely not cathepsin-E. To realize this, it is indispensable to find out the structural difference of the three enzymes. Since the crystal structures of BACE1 and cathepsin-D are already known, the lack of three-dimensional structure of cathepsin-E has become the bottleneck in this regard. In view of this, the three-dimensional structure of cathepsin-E has been developed. Although the overall structures of the three enzymes are quite similar to each other, some subtle difference around their active sites that distinguishes cathepsin-E from cathepsin-D and BACE1 has been revealed through an analysis of hydrogen bond network and microenvironment. The computed three-dimensional structure of cathepsin-E and the relevant findings might provide useful insights for designing inhibitors with the desired selectivity.","0006-291X","Biochemical and biophysical research communications","(331) 56-60",2005,"Kuo-Chen","Chou","KC","Gordon Life Science Institute, 13784 Torrey Del Mar, San Diego, CA 92130, USA. kchou@san.rr.com"

Here we report the stepwise identification and characterization of a novel APP-beta-site mutant, ""NFEV"" (APP_NFEV) in vitro and in cells. In vitro, the APP_NFEV exhibits 100-fold enhanced cleavage rate relative to the ""wild-type"" substrate (APPwt) and 10-fold increase relative to the Swedish-type mutation variant (APPsw). In cells, it was preferably cleaved among 24 APP beta-site mutations tested. More importantly, the APP_NFEV mutant failed to generate any detectable Abeta peptides in BACE1-KO mouse fibroblast cells. The production of Abeta peptides was restored by co-transfecting human BACE1, demonstrating that BACE1 is the only enzyme responsible for the processing of APP_NFEV in these cells. Analysis of APP_NFEV cleavage products secreted in the media revealed that in cells BACE1 cleaves APP_NFEV at the position between NF and EV, identical to that observed in vitro. A BACE inhibitor blocked the processing of the APP_NFEV beta-site in vitro and in cells. Our data indicates that the ""NFEV"" mutant is not only an enhanced substrate for BACE1 in vitro, but also a specific substrate for BACE1 in cells.","1387-2877","Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD","(7) 139-48; discussion 173-80",2005,"Xiao-Ping","Shi","XP","Department of Biological Chemistry, Merck Research Laboratories, West Point, PA 19486, USA. xiao-ping_shi@merck.com"

Abeta is derived from beta amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta- and gamma-secretases. Beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) has been identified as the major beta-secretase. BACE2 is the homolog of BACE1. The BACE2 gene is on chromosome 21 and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of AD. However, the function of BACE2 in Abeta generation is controversial. Some studies have shown that BACE2 cleaved APP at the beta-site whereas other studies showed it cleaved around the alpha-secretase site. To elucidate the involvement of BACE2 in AD pathogenesis, we compared BACE2 and BACE1 gene regulation and their functions in Abeta generation. We cloned and functionally characterized the human BACE2 promoter. The BACE2 gene is controlled by a TATA-less promoter. Though Sp1 can regulate both BACE1 and BACE2 genes, comparative sequence analysis and transcription factor prediction showed little similarity between the two promoters. BACE1 increased APP cleavage at the beta-site and Abeta production whereas BACE2 did not. Overexpression of BACE2 significantly increased sAPP levels in conditioned media but markedly reduced Abeta production. Knockdown of BACE2 resulted in increased APP C83. Our data indicate that despite being homologous in amino acid sequence, BACE2 and BACE1 have distinct functions and transcriptional regulation. BACE2 is not a beta-secretase, but processes APP within the Abeta domain at a site downstream of the alpha-secretase cleavage site. Our data argue against BACE2 being involved in the formation of neuritic plaques in AD.","1530-6860","FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology","(19) 739-49",2005,"Xiulian","Sun","X","Department of Psychiatry, Brain Research Center, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada."

A fluorescent Eu-chelate as fluorescent donor, coupled to the N-terminus of a peptide containing the amyloid precursor protein Swedish mutation with a quenching molecule at the C-terminus as acceptor, is used as substrate. Upon peptide cleavage by BACE1, the energy transfer between donor and acceptor molecules is interrupted, leading to increased fluorescence emission of the donor. Compound interference, a common problem in fluorescence assays, is minimized with this technology because of the large Stoke's shift and the time-resolved fluorescence emission of the Eu-chelate. The assay reproduced IC50 values of known inhibitors and detected them also as hits in a screening campaign.

Invalidation of presenilin genes was reported to impair both gamma-secretase-mediated Abeta production and Notch cleavage leading to NICD production. This observation together with another biochemical and pharmacological evidences led to suggest that presenilins could be the genuine long-searched gamma-secretase that would be responsible for both APP and Notch cleavages. We have designed novel non peptidic potential inhibitors of gamma-secretase (referred to as JLK inhibitors) and examined their ability to prevent Abeta40 and Abeta42 secretions as well as NICD production. Three out of a series of these agents drastically lower the recoveries of both Abeta40 and Abeta42 produced by betaAPP-expressing cell lines and concomitantly protect intracellular C99 and C83 recoveries. These inhibitors also prevent Abeta40/42 productions by C99-expressing cells. Interestingly, these inhibitors were totally unable to affect the DeltaENotch cleavage leading to NICD generation.

Therefore, we have generated bace1, bace2, and double knockout mice. We report here that BACE1 mice display a complex phenotype. A variable but significant number of BACE1 offspring died in the first weeks after birth. The surviving mice remained smaller than their littermate controls and presented a hyperactive behavior. Electrophysiologically, subtle alterations in the steady-state inactivation of voltage-gated sodium channels in BACE1-deficient neurons were observed. In contrast, bace2 knockout mice displayed an overall healthy phenotype. However, a combined deficiency of BACE2 and BACE1 enhanced the bace1-/- lethality phenotype. At the biochemical level, we have confirmed that BACE1 deficiency results in an almost complete block of Abeta generation in neurons, but not in glia. As glia are 10 times more abundant in brain compared with neurons, our data indicate that BACE2 could indeed contribute to Abeta generation in the brains of Alzheimer disease and, in particular, Down syndrome patients.

16027115,"High beta-secretase activity elicits neurodegeneration in transgenic mice despite reductions in amyloid-beta levels: implications for the treatment of Alzheimer disease.","Amyloid-beta peptides (Abeta) are widely presumed to play a causal role in Alzheimer disease. Release of Abeta from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) requires proteolysis by the beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme (BACE1). Although increased BACE1 activity in Alzheimer disease brains and human (h) BACE1 transgenic (tg) mice results in altered APP cleavage, the contribution of these molecular alterations to neurodegeneration is unclear. We therefore used the murine Thy1 promoter to express high levels of hBACE1, with or without hAPP, in neurons of tg mice. Compared with hAPP mice, hBACE1/hAPP doubly tg mice had increased levels of APP C-terminal fragments (C89, C83) and decreased levels of full-length APP and Abeta. In contrast to non-tg controls and hAPP mice, hBACE1 mice and hBACE1/hAPP mice showed degeneration of neurons in the neocortex and hippocampus and degradation of myelin. Neurological deficits were also more severe in hBACE1 and hBACE1/hAPP mice than in hAPP mice. These results demonstrate that high levels of BACE1 activity are sufficient to elicit neurodegeneration and neurological decline in vivo. This pathogenic pathway involves the accumulation of APP C-terminal fragments but does not depend on increased production of human Abeta. Thus, inhibiting BACE1 may block not only Abeta-dependent but also Abeta-independent pathogenic mechanisms.","0021-9258","The Journal of biological chemistry","(280) 32957-67",2005,"Edward","Rockenstein","E","Department of Neurosciences, University of California, San Diego, School of Medicine, La Jolla, California 92093-0624, USA."

Therefore, preventing beta-amyloid formation by inhibition of the beta site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme (BACE) 1 is considered as a potential strategy to treat AD. Cholinergic mechanisms have been shown to control amyloid precursor protein processing and the number of muscarinic M2-acetylcholine receptors is decreased in brain regions of patients with AD enriched with senile plaques. Therefore, the present study investigates the effect of this M2 muscarinic receptor down-regulation by siRNA on total gene expression and on regulation of BACE1 in particular in SK-SH-SY5Y cells. This model system was used for microarray analysis after carbachol stimulation of siRNA-treated cells compared with carbachol stimulated, non-siRNA-treated cells. The same model system was used to elucidate changes at the protein level by using two-dimensional gels followed by Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) analysis. Taken together, the results indicate that the M2 acetylcholine receptor down-regulation in brains of patients with AD has important effects on the expression of several genes and proteins with major functions in the pathology of AD. This includes beta-secretase BACE1 as well as several modulators of the tau protein and other AD-relevant genes and proteins.

NSAIDs inhibit the enzymatic activity of cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and inducible COX-2, which catalyze the first committed step in the synthesis of prostaglandins. These studies implicate COX-mediated inflammation as an early and potentially reversible preclinical event; however, the mechanism by which COX activity promotes development of AD has not been determined. Recent studies implicate the prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) E prostanoid subtype 2 (EP2) receptor in the development of the innate immune response in brain. Here, we report that deletion of the PGE2 EP2 receptor in the APPSwe-PS1DeltaE9 model of familial AD results in marked reductions in lipid peroxidation in aging mice. This reduction in oxidative stress is associated with significant decreases in levels of amyloid-beta (Abeta) 40 and 42 peptides and amyloid deposition. Aged APPSwe-PS1DeltaE9 mice lacking the EP2 receptor harbor lower levels of beta C-terminal fragments, the product of beta-site APP cleaving enzyme (BACE1) processing of amyloid precursor protein. Increases in BACE1 processing have been demonstrated in models of aging and AD and after oxidative stress. Our results indicate that PGE2 signaling via the EP2 receptor promotes age-dependent oxidative damage and increased Abeta peptide burden in this model of AD, possibly via effects on BACE1 activity. Our findings identify EP2 receptor signaling as a novel proinflammatory and proamyloidogenic pathway in this model of AD, and suggest a rationale for development of therapeutics targeting the EP2 receptor in neuroinflammatory diseases such as AD.","1529-2401","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","(25) 10180-7",2005,"Xibin","Liang","X","Department of Neurology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21205, USA."

Using these antibodies, BACE1 was characterized in temporal lobe cortices by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemical studies employing anti-GFAP and anti-MAP2 antibodies as well as anti-BACE1 antibodies showed that BACE1 was expressed exclusively in neurons but not in glial cells. Brain samples were directly extracted by 0.5% SDS and analyzed by Western blotting and densitometer. Although the mean level of BACE1/mg protein in AD brains was not increased, the ratio of BACE1 to MAP2 or to NSE was significantly increased compared with that in control brains. Taken together, these findings suggest that those neurons that survive in AD brains might generate more BACE1 than normal neurons in control brains, indicating that increased BACE1 activity could be one of the causes of AD.

16305800,"Crystal structure of human BACE2 in complex with a hydroxyethylamine transition-state inhibitor.","BACE2 is a membrane-bound aspartic protease of the A1 family with a high level of sequence homology to BACE1. While BACE1 is involved in the generation of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease by cleaving Abeta-peptides from the amyloid precursor protein, the physiological function of BACE2 is not well understood. BACE2 appears to be associated with the early onset of dementia in patients with Down's syndrome, and it has been shown to be highly expressed in breast cancers. Further, it may participate in the function of normal and abnormal processes of human muscle biology. Similar to other aspartic proteases, BACE2 is expressed as an inactive zymogen requiring the cleavage of its pro-sequence during the maturation process. We have produced mature BACE2 by expression of pro-BACE2 in Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies, followed by refolding and autocatalytic activation at pH 3.4. Using a C and N-terminally truncated BACE2 variant, we were able to crystallize and determine the crystal structure of mature BACE2 in complex with a hydroxyethylamine transition-state mimetic inhibitor at 3.1 angstroms resolution. The structure of BACE2 follows the general fold of A1 aspartic proteases. However, similar to BACE1, its C-terminal domain is significantly larger than that of the other family members. Furthermore, the structure of BACE2 reveals differences in the S3, S2, S1' and S2' active site substrate pockets as compared to BACE1, and allows, therefore, for a deeper understanding of the structural features that may facilitate the design of selective BACE1 or BACE2 inhibitors.","0022-2836","Journal of molecular biology","(355) 249-61",2006,"Nils","Ostermann","N","Protease Platform, Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, CH-4002 Basel, Switzerland. nils.ostermann@novartis.com"

BACE1 levels and activity are increased in AD brain and are likely to drive Abeta overproduction, but the cause of BACE1 elevation in AD is unknown. Interestingly, cerebral glucose metabolism and blood flow are both reduced in preclinical AD, suggesting that impaired energy production may be an early pathologic event in AD. To determine whether reduced energy metabolism would cause BACE1 elevation, we used pharmacological agents (insulin, 2-deoxyglucose, 3-nitropropionic acid, and kainic acid) to induce acute energy inhibition in C57/B6 wild-type and amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic (Tg2576) mice. Four hours after treatment, we observed that reduced energy production caused a approximately 150% increase of cerebral BACE1 levels compared with control. Although this was a modest increase, the effect was long-lasting, because levels of the BACE1 enzyme remained elevated for at least 7 d after a single dose of energy inhibitor. In Tg2576 mice, levels of the BACE1-cleaved APP ectodomain APPsbeta were also elevated and paralleled the BACE1 increase in both relative amount and duration. Importantly, cerebral Abeta40 levels in Tg2576 were increased to approximately 200% of control at 7 d after injection, demonstrating that energy inhibition was potentially amyloidogenic. These results support the hypothesis that impaired energy production in the brain may drive AD pathogenesis by elevating BACE1 levels and activity, which, in turn, lead to Abeta overproduction. This process may represent one of the earliest pathogenic events in AD.","1529-2401","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","(25) 10874-83",2005,"Rodney A","Velliquette","RA","Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Northwestern University, The Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois 60611, USA."

The major component of the plaques, amyloid beta peptide (Abeta), is generated from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta- and gamma-secretase-mediated cleavage. Because beta-secretase/beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) knockout mice produce much less Abeta and grow normally, a beta-secretase inhibitor is thought to be one of the most attractive targets for the development of therapeutic interventions for AD without apparent side-effects. Here, we report the in vivo inhibitory effects of a novel beta-secretase inhibitor, KMI-429, a transition-state mimic, which effectively inhibits beta-secretase activity in cultured cells in a dose-dependent manner. We injected KMI-429 into the hippocampus of APP transgenic mice. KMI-429 significantly reduced Abeta production in vivo in the soluble fraction compared with vehicle, but the level of Abeta in the insoluble fraction was unaffected. In contrast, an intrahippocampal injection of KMI-429 in wild-type mice remarkably reduced Abeta production in both the soluble and insoluble fractions.

BACE1 (beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1) is responsible for the initial required step in the neuronal amyloidogenic processing of beta-amyloid precursor protein and is a major drug target for the therapeutic intervention of AD. In the present study, BACE1 is initially synthesized as an immature precursor protein containing part of the pre domain and the entire pro domain, and undergoes autocatalytic conversion to yield the well-folded mature BACE1 enzyme. To understand the mechanism of the conversion and the role of the pro domain, we monitored the autocatalytic conversion of BACE1 by heteronuclear NMR spectroscopy and used chemical shift perturbations as a probe to study the structural changes accompanying the autocatalytic conversion. NMR data revealed local conformational changes from a partially disordered to a well-folded conformation associated with the conversion. The conformational changes are largely concentrated in the NH(2)-terminal lobe. Conversely, the active site conformations are conserved during the autocatalytic conversion. The precursor and mature BACE1 proteins were further characterized for their ability to interact with a substrate-based transition state BACE1 peptide inhibitor. The precursor BACE1 rapidly adopted the bound conformation in the presence of the inhibitor, which is identical to the bound conformation of the mature protein. The interaction of the inhibitor with both the precursor BACE1 and the fully processed BACE1 is in slow exchange on the NMR time scale, indicating a tight binding interaction. Overall, the NMR data demonstrated that the pro domain does not hinder inhibitor binding and may assist in the proper folding of the protein. The fully processed BACE1 represents a high quality well-folded protein which is highly stable over a long period of time, and is suitable for evaluation of inhibitor binding by NMR for drug intervention.","0006-2960","Biochemistry","(44) 16594-601",2005,"Yu-Sen","Wang","YS","Schering-Plough Research Institute, 2015 Galloping Hill Road, Kenilworth, New Jersey 07033, USA. allen.yu-sen.wang@spcorp.com"

We now demonstrate that BACE1, enriched in neurons of the CNS, is a major determinant that predisposes the brain to Abeta amyloidogenesis. The physiologically high levels of BACE1 activity coupled with low levels of BACE2 and alpha-secretase anti-amyloidogenic activities in neurons is a major contributor to the accumulation of Abeta in the CNS, whereas other organs are spared. Significantly, deletion of BACE1 in APPswe;PS1DeltaE9 mice prevents both Abeta deposition and age-associated cognitive abnormalities that occur in this model of Abeta amyloidosis. Moreover, Abeta deposits are sensitive to BACE1 dosage and can be efficiently cleared from the CNS when BACE1 is silenced. However, BACE1 null mice manifest alterations in hippocampal synaptic plasticity as well as in performance on tests of cognition and emotion. Importantly, memory deficits but not emotional alterations in BACE1(-/-) mice are prevented by coexpressing APPswe;PS1DeltaE9 transgenes, indicating that other potential substrates of BACE1 may affect neural circuits related to emotion. Our results establish BACE1 and APP processing pathways as critical for cognitive, emotional, and synaptic functions, and future studies should be alert to potential mechanism-based side effects that may occur with BACE1 inhibitors designed to ameliorate Abeta amyloidosis in AD.","1529-2401","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","(25) 11693-709",2005,"Fiona M","Laird","FM","Department of Pathology, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland 21205, USA."

The accumulation and deposition of Abeta is hypothesized to cause AD pathogenesis, leading to the debilitating neurological deficits observed in AD patients. However, it is unclear how processing of APP to generate Abeta corresponds with the age-dependent pattern of brain-regional neurodegeneration common in AD. We have previously shown that overexpression of BACE1, the primary beta-secretase gene, in mice expressing an AD mutant form of APP leads to significantly elevated regional Abeta levels, which coincide with the regional pattern of Abeta deposition. In the current study, we have used our genomic-based beta-secretase transgenic mice to determine how BACE1 regulates the spatial and temporal pattern of Abeta production throughout post-natal development. Specifically, we observed unique differences in the brain-regional expression pattern between neonatal and adult BACE1 transgenic mice. These alterations in the BACE1 expression profile directly corresponds with age-related differences in regional Abeta production and deposition. These studies indicate that modulation of BACE1 expression leads to dramatic alterations in APP processing and AD-like neuropathology. Furthermore, our studies provide further evidence that BACE1 plays a major role in the regulation of the APP processing pathway, influencing the age-dependent onset of AD pathogenesis.","1558-1497","Neurobiology of aging","(28) 75-84",2007,"Matthew J","Chiocco","MJ","Department of Genetics, Case Western Reserve University and University Hospitals of Cleveland, Cleveland, OH 44106, USA."

Conversely, overexpression of PPARgamma, as well as NSAIDs and PPARgamma activators, reduced BACE1 gene promoter activity. These results suggested that PPARgamma could be a repressor of BACE1. We then identified a PPARgamma responsive element (PPRE) in the BACE1 gene promoter. Mutagenesis of the PPRE abolished the binding of PPARgamma to the PPRE and increased BACE1 gene promoter activity. Furthermore, proinflammatory cytokines decreased PPARgamma gene transcription, and this effect was supressed by NSAIDs. We also demonstrate that in vivo treatment with PPARgamma agonists increased PPARgamma and reduced BACE1 mRNA and intracellular beta-amyloid levels. Interestingly, brain extracts from AD patients showed decreased PPARgamma expression and binding to PPRE in the BACE1 gene promoter. Our data strongly support a major role of PPARgamma in the modulation of amyloid-beta generation by inflammation and suggest that the protective mechanism of NSAIDs in AD involves activation of PPARgamma and decreased BACE1 gene transcription.","0027-8424","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","(103) 443-8",2006,"Magdalena","Sastre","M","Department of Neurology, University of Bonn, Sigmund Freud Strasse 25, 53127 Bonn, Germany. magdalena.sastre@ukb.uni-bonn.de"

Sialylation-deficient mutant (Lec-2) cells secreted half as much Abeta as wild-type Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Furthermore, wild-type CHO cells showed enhanced secretion of the APP metabolites upon ST6Gal-I overexpression, whereas Lec-2 cells did not, indicating that the secretion enhancement requires sialylation of cellular protein(s). Secretion of metabolites from a mutant APP (APP-Asn467,496Ala) that lacked N-glycosylation sites was not enhanced upon ST6Gal-I overexpression, suggesting that the N-glycans on APP itself are required for the enhanced secretion. In the mouse brain, the amount of alpha2,6-sialylated APP appeared to be correlated with the sAPPbeta level.

This behavioral test requires hippocampus-dependent temporal memory processing as the conditioned and unconditioned stimuli are separated by a trace interval of 30 s.

Both transgenic groups performed as well as wild-type control mice in delay fear conditioning when the trace interval was removed, indicating that the trace conditioning deficits are hippocampus-specific. Importantly, Tg6799 mice engineered to lack the major Alzheimer's beta-secretase (beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1: BACE1) showed behavioral rescue from temporal memory deficits. Elevated levels of soluble Abeta oligomers found in Tg6799+ mouse brains returned to wild-type control levels without changes in APP/PS1 transgene expression in BACE1-/- * Tg6799+ bigenic mouse brains, suggesting Abeta oligomers as potential mediators of memory loss.

To examine this issue, tightly controlled inducible BACE1 gene expression was established in the neuronal cell line N2ABP1 and the non-neuronal cell line E2BP1 using an ecdysone-inducible system. The BACE1 protein level was increased in a time- and dosage-dependent manner in the inducible BACE1 stable cells by treatment with inducer ponasterone A. The generation of APP CTFbeta, the beta-secretase product, increased proportionally with the level of BACE1 protein expression. However, Abeta40/42 production sharply increased to the plateau level with a relatively small increase in BACE1 expression. Although further increasing BACE1 expression increased beta-secretase activity, it had no additional effect on Abeta production. Furthermore, we found that BACE1 mRNA levels and BACE1 promoter activity were significantly lower than APP mRNA levels and APP promoter activity. Our data demonstrate that lower BACE transcription is responsible for the minority of APP undergoing the amyloidogenic pathway and relatively lower Abeta production in the normal conditions, and that a slight increase in BACE1 can induce a dramatic elevation in Abeta production, indicating that the increase in BACE1 can potentially increase neuritic plaque formation in the pathological condition.","1530-6860","FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology","(20) 285-92",2006,"Yu","Li","Y","Department of Psychiatry, Brain Research Center, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada."

16511867,"Cerebrolysin decreases amyloid-beta production by regulating amyloid protein precursor maturation in a transgenic model of Alzheimer's disease.","Cerebrolysin is a peptide mixture with neurotrophic effects that might reduce the neurodegenerative pathology in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have previously shown in an amyloid protein precursor (APP) transgenic (tg) mouse model of AD-like neuropathology that Cerebrolysin ameliorates behavioral deficits, is neuroprotective, and decreases amyloid burden; however, the mechanisms involved are not completely clear. Cerebrolysin might reduce amyloid deposition by regulating amyloid-beta (Abeta) degradation or by modulating APP expression, maturation, or processing. To investigate these possibilities, APP tg mice were treated for 6 months with Cerebrolysin and analyzed in the water maze, followed by RNA, immunoblot, and confocal microscopy analysis of full-length (FL) APP and its fragments, beta-secretase (BACE1), and Abeta-degrading enzymes [neprilysin (Nep) and insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE)]. Consistent with previous studies, Cerebrolysin ameliorated the performance deficits in the spatial learning portion of the water maze and reduced the synaptic pathology and amyloid burden in the brains of APP tg mice. These effects were associated with reduced levels of FL APP and APP C-terminal fragments, but levels of BACE1, Notch1, Nep, and IDE were unchanged. In contrast, levels of active cyclin-dependent kinase-5 (CDK5) and glycogen synthase kinase-3beta [GSK-3beta; but not stress-activated protein kinase-1 (SAPK1)], kinases that phosphorylate APP, were reduced. Furthermore, Cerebrolysin reduced the levels of phosphorylated APP and the accumulation of APP in the neuritic processes. Taken together, these results suggest that Cerebrolysin might reduce AD-like pathology in the APP tg mice by regulating APP maturation and transport to sites where Abeta protein is generated. This study clarifies the mechanisms through which Cerebrolysin might reduce Abeta production and deposition in AD and further supports the importance of this compound in the potential treatment of early AD.","0360-4012","Journal of neuroscience research","(83) 1252-61",2006,"Edward","Rockenstein","E","Department of Neurosciences, University of California San Diego, School of Medicine, La Jolla, California 92093-0624, USA."

BACE1 expression and enzymatic activity are increased in the AD brain, but the regulatory mechanisms of BACE1 expression are largely unknown. Here we show that Yin Yang 1 (YY1), a highly conserved and multifunctional transcription factor, binds to its putative recognition sequence within the BACE1 promoter and stimulates BACE1 promoter activity in rat pheochromocytoma 12 (PC12) cells, rat primary neurones and astrocytes. In rat brain YY1 and BACE1 are widely expressed by neurons, but there was only a minor proportion of neurones that co-expressed YY1 and BACE1, suggesting that YY1 is not required for constitutive neuronal BACE1 expression. Resting astrocytes in the untreated rat brain did not display either YY1 or BACE1 immunoreactivity. When chronically activated, however, astrocytes expressed both YY1 and BACE1 proteins, indicating that YY1 is important for the stimulated BACE1 expression by reactive astrocytes. This is further emphasized by the expression of YY1 and BACE1 by reactive astrocytes in proximity to beta-amyloid plaques in the AD brain. Our observations suggest that interfering with expression, translocation or binding of YY1 to its BACE1 promoter-specific sequence may have therapeutic potential for treating patients with AD.","0022-3042","Journal of neurochemistry","(96) 1696-707",2006,"Katrin","Nowak","K","Paul Flechsig Institute for Brain Research, Department of Neurochemistry, University of Leipzig, Leipzig, Germany."

16611010,"Vicious cycles within the neuropathophysiologic mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease.","Rigorous scientific research has identified multiple interactive mechanisms that parallel and are likely causative of the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Causative mechanisms include genomics, the creation of amyloid beta (Abeta), factors inhibiting the Abeta removal process, the transformation of Abeta to its toxic forms (various forms of Abeta aggregation), and lastly the oxidative, inflammatory, and other effects of toxic Abeta. Fibrillar beta-amyloid peptide, a major component of senile plaques in AD brain, is known to induce microglial-mediated neurotoxicity under certain conditions, but some recent studies support the notion that Abeta oligomers are the primary neurotoxins. Abeta-42 oligomers that are soluble and highly neurotoxic, referred to as Abeta-derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs), assemble under conditions that block fibril formation. These oligomers bind to dendrite surfaces in small clusters with ligand-like specificity and are capable of destroying hippocampal neurons at nanomolar concentrations. Evidence is presented that AD is triggered by these soluble, neurotoxic assemblies of Abeta rather than the late stage pathology landmarks of amyloid plaques and tangles. The premise is that AD symptoms stem from aberrant nerve cell signaling and synaptic failure rather than nerve cell death, which nevertheless follows and exacerbates the initial pathologies of AD. The defective clearance of amyloid leads to amyloid angiopathy that in turn perpetuates hypoperfusion that affects formation as well as absorption of CSF thereby altering clearance of amyloid and promoting vascular and parenchymal deposition[1]. Hypoperfusion, the defective clearance of amyloid, and resultant increase in amyloid deposition thus represent a vicious cycle. Chronic vascular hypoperfusion-induced mitochondrial failure results in oxidative damage, which drives caspase 3-mediated Abeta peptide secretion and enhances amyloidogenic APP processing. Intracellular Abeta accumulation in turn promotes a significant oxidative and inflammatory mechanism that generates a vicious cycle of Abeta generation and oxidation, each accelerating the other. Abeta activates astrocytes that add to the oxidative imbalance, upregulate the expression of APP via TGF-beta, and are capable of expressing BACE1. Each of these 3 actions accelerates the larger cycle of cholinergic neuron destruction. As oxidative stress induces lesions of cholinergic nuclei producing a reduction in cholinergic neurotransmission, a subsequent increase in cortical APP involving PKCepsilon leads to accelerated amyloidogenic APP metabolism. The linkage of cholinergic activation and APP metabolism completes an additional feedback loop wherein the damage wrought by Abeta accelerates further Abeta production. A comprehensive vision of the neuropathophysiologic mechanisms that result in AD reveals several vicious cycles within a larger vicious cycle, that is to say, a number of interactive systems that each, once set in motion, amplify their own processes, thus accelerating the development of AD.","1567-2050","Current Alzheimer research","(3) 95-108",2006,"John B","Standridge","JB","Department of Family Medicine, University of Tennessee Health Science Center College of Medicine, Chattanooga, Tennessee 37403, USA. john.standridge@erlanger.org"

Abeta deposition in the brain is the hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) neuropathology. Inhibition of BACE1 activity has major pharmaceutical potential for AD treatment. The expression of the BACE1 gene is relatively low in vivo. The control of BACE1 expression has not been well defined. There are six upstream AUGs (uAUGs) in the 5' leader sequence of the human BACE1 mRNA. We investigated the role of the promoter and the uATGs in the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of the human BACE1 gene in BACE1 gene transcription and translation initiation. Our results show that the first and second uATGs are the integral part of the core minimal promoter of the human BACE1 gene, while the third uAUG is skipped over by ribosomal scanning. The fourth uAUG can function as a translation initiation codon, and deletion or mutation of this uAUG increases downstream gene expression. The fourth uAUG of the BACE1 5'UTR is responsible for inhibiting the expression of BACE1. Translation initiation by the BACE1 uAUGs and physiological AUG requires intact eIF4G. Our results demonstrate that during human BACE1 gene expression, ribosomes skipped some uAUGs by leaky scanning and translated an upstream open reading frame, initiated efficiently at the fourth uAUG, and subsequently reinitiated BACE1 translation at the physiological AUG site. Such leaky scanning and reinitiation resulted in weak expression of BACE1 under normal conditions. Alterations of the leaky scanning and reinitiation in BACE1 gene expression could play an important role in AD pathogenesis.","0270-7306","Molecular and cellular biology","(26) 3353-64",2006,"Weihui","Zhou","W","Department of Psychiatry, University of British Columbia, 2255 Wesbrook Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada."

Here, we show that the insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1-R), the common regulator of lifespan and age-related events in many different organisms, is responsible for the TrkA-to-p75(NTR) switch in both human neuroblastoma cell lines and primary neurons from mouse brain. The signaling pathway that controls the level of TrkA and p75(NTR) downstream of the IGF1-R requires IRS2, PIP3/Akt, and is under the control of PTEN and p44, the short isoform of p53.

The limiting step in generating the Abeta peptide from APP is cleavage by the beta-secretase enzyme, BACE1. Regulation of the BACE1 gene is likely to play an important role in AD etiology and treatment. We therefore studied the activity of a 4.1-kb 5'-flanking region (-3765/+364, +1 being the transcription start site) of the BACE1 gene, both in 5'- and 3'-deletion series and through Northern blotting. We show that the BACE1 promoter has regulatory activity throughout the 4.1-kb length, both positive and negative, and that this activity can be quantitatively modeled according to promoter sequence length, with the specific model depending on the presence of negative regulatory elements as the 5'- most portion of the sequence. We also examined a previously identified 141-bp proximal fragment (+224/+364) of the BACE1 promoter and two constituent (91- and 50-bp) subfragments. We report that the 91-bp fragment (+224/+314) is the most likely seat of neuronal expression of the BACE1 gene and that it is the portion of the 141-bp fragment that accounts for observed DNA-protein interactions in brain extracts. The 50-bp fragment (+315/+364), which showed significant reporter gene activity from the empty vector, binds nuclear proteins in a cell type-specific manner and contains the AP2 site as shown by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Overall, the 141-bp fragment had no strong matches within GenBank, and the 91-bp fragment is predicted to have several potential stem-loop sites. Taken together, BACE1 gene promoter activity is differentially regulated, and the 91-bp fragment represents a novel promoter region for cell type-specific regulation. This fragment might be a useful target to regulate BACE1 expression leading to Abeta production and to understand the neuropathogenesis of AD.","0895-8696","Journal of molecular neuroscience : MN","(28) 193-210",2006,"Debomoy K","Lahiri","DK","Laboratory of Molecular Neurogenetics, Department of Psychiatry, Institute of Psychiatric Research, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA. dlahiri@iupui.edu"

High cholesterol content in neurons is accompanied by an increase in the level of BACE1, the enzyme that initially cleaves beta-amyloid precursor protein to generate Abeta, causing the accumulation of Abeta1-42 peptide. These effects correlate with the phosphorylation of tau and the activation of extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK).

Heparin can promote beta-secretase cleavage of APP in neuroblastoma cells. However, heparin has also been reported to directly inhibit BACE1 activity in vitro. To clarify the role of heparin in regulating BACE1, we examined the effect of heparin on the activity of recombinant human BACE1 (rBACE1) in vitro. Low concentrations (1 microg/mL) of heparin were found to stimulate rBACE1, increasing enzyme V(max) and decreasing the K(M). In contrast, higher concentrations of heparin (10 or 100 microg/mL) were inhibitory. Heparin affinity chromatography demonstrated that heparin interacted strongly with the zymogen form of rBACE1 and bound to a peptide homologous to the N-terminal pro sequence of BACE1. Mature (pro sequence cleaved) enzyme lacked the capacity to be stimulated by heparin, indicating that the pro domain was necessary for the stimulation by heparin. Furthermore, in the presence of stimulatory concentrations of heparin, there was an increase in autocatalytic cleavage of the protease domain and a subsequent loss of enzyme activity in vitro. Our results strongly suggest that heparin stimulates the partially active BACE1 zymogen, and we propose that the activation is mediated by high-affinity binding of heparin to the pro domain.

16734669,"Inhibition of APP trafficking by tau protein does not increase the generation of amyloid-beta peptides.","Amyloid-beta, a peptide derived from the precursor protein APP, accumulates in the brain and contributes to the neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease. Increased generation of amyloid-beta might be caused by axonal transport inhibition, via increased dwell time of APP vesicles and thereby higher probability of APP cleavage by secretase enzymes residing on the same vesicles. We tested this hypothesis using a neuronal cell culture model of inhibited axonal transport and by imaging vesicular transport of fluorescently tagged APP and beta-secretase (BACE1). Microtubule-associated tau protein blocks vesicle traffic by inhibiting the access of motor proteins to the microtubule tracks. In neurons co-transfected with CFP-tau, APP-YFP traffic into distal neurites was strongly reduced. However, this did not increase amyloid-beta levels. In singly transfected axons, APP-YFP was transported in large tubules and vesicles moving very fast (on average 3 microm/s) and with high fluxes in the anterograde direction (on average 8.4 vesicles/min). By contrast, BACE1-CFP movement was in smaller tubules and vesicles that were almost 2x slower (on average 1.6 microm/s) with approximately 18x lower fluxes (on average 0.5 vesicles/min). Two-colour microscopy of co-transfected axons confirmed that the two proteins were sorted into distinct carriers. The results do not support the above hypothesis. Instead, they indicate that APP is transported on vesicles distinct from the secretase components and that amyloid-beta is not generated in transit when transport is blocked by tau.","1398-9219","Traffic (Copenhagen, Denmark)","(7) 873-88",2006,"Claire","Goldsbury","C","Max Planck Unit for Structural Molecular Biology, c/o DESY, Notkestrasse 85, 22607 Hamburg, Germany."

The BACE1 sequence contains more repetitive elements than does BACE2 (no elements). Regulatory domains do not overlap strongly between the two promoter regions. The BACE1upstream sequence contains both negative and positive domains, separated from the transcription seat by a long neutral domain. The corresponding BACE2sequence consists of a weakly positive domain directly upstream of a strongly positive domain, near a functionally active domain. DNA-protein interaction was corroborated by functional data. In primary rat cortical cultures, BACE1-driven reporter protein's expression was twice that of BACE2- driven reporter. The BACE2 gene promoter relatively reduced function in neuronal cells compared with BACE1. The BACE1 gene might operate through a single transcriptional control site. BACE2 operates through dual transcriptional control sites. Two (or more) regulatory pathways might control transcription in BACE2.

Similar increases are found after experimental ischemia in animals. It is possible that increased beta-amyloid deposition arises from alterations in amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism, indeed, we have shown that exposing cells of neuronal origin to chronic hypoxia decreased the secretion of soluble APP (sAPPalpha) derived by action of alpha-secretase on APP, coinciding with a decrease in protein levels of ADAM10, a disintegrin metalloprotease which is thought to be the major alpha-secretase. In the current study, we extended those observations to determine whether the expression of ADAM10 and another putative alpha-secretase, TACE, as well as the beta-secretase, BACE1 were regulated by chronic hypoxia at the level of protein and mRNA. Using Western blotting and RT-PCR, we demonstrate that after 48 h chronic hypoxia, such that sAPPalpha secretion is decreased by over 50%, protein levels of ADAM10 and TACE and by approximately 60% and 40% respectively with no significant decrease in BACE1 levels. In contrast, no change in the expression of the mRNA for these proteins could be detected.

These results suggest that Abeta accumulation is initiated in a small number of neurons by intracellular determinants that alter APP metabolism and lead to Abeta deposition and neurodegeneration.

The mechanism underlying AD neuropathology in DS has been unknown. Abeta is the central component of neuritic plaques and is generated from APP by cleavage by the beta- and gamma-secretases. Here we show that beta-secretase activity is markedly elevated in DS. The ratio of mature to immature forms of BACE1 is altered in DS. DS has significantly higher levels of mature BACE1 proteins in Golgi than normal controls. Time-lapse live image analysis showed that BACE1 proteins were predominantly immobile in Golgi in DS cells, while they underwent normal trafficking in controls. Thus, overproduction of Abeta in DS is caused by abnormal BACE1 protein trafficking and maturation. Our results provide a novel molecular mechanism by which AD develops in DS and support the therapeutic potential of inhibiting BACE1 in AD and DS.","1530-6860","FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology","(20) 1361-8",2006,"Xiulian","Sun","X","Department of Psychiatry, Brain Research Center, The University of British Columbia, 2255 Wesbrook Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada."

Beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is the major beta-secretase in vivo. Beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 2 (BACE2) is the homologue of BACE1. The majority of people with Down syndrome (DS), also called Trisomy 21 syndrome, will develop AD neuropathology after middle age. We and others have shown that APP C99, the major beta-secretase product, and Abeta are markedly increased in DS. Since BACE2 is located on chromosome 21, it is speculated that BACE2 may play a role in AD pathogenesis in DS. In this report we found that BACE2 cleaves APP at a novel theta site downstream of the alpha site, abolishing Abeta production. Overexpression of BACE2 by lentivirus markedly reduced Abeta production in primary neurons derived from Swedish mutant APP transgenic mice. Despite an extra copy of the BACE2 gene in DS and the increase of its transcription, BACE2 protein levels are unchanged. Our data clearly demonstrate that BACE2, as a novel theta-secretase to cleave APP within the Abeta domain, is not involved in the AD pathogenesis of DS patients; instead, therapeutic interventions that potentiate BACE2 may prevent AD pathogenesis.","1530-6860","FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology","(20) 1369-76",2006,"Xiulian","Sun","X","Department of Psychiatry, Brain Research Center, The University of British Columbia, 2255 Wesbrook Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada."

Growing evidence shows that lipid rafts are critically involved in regulating the Abeta generation. In support of this, APP, Abeta, and presenilins have been found in lipid rafts. Although cholesterol plays a crucial role in maintaining lipid rafts, functions of other components in the generation of Abeta are unknown. Caveolins (CAVs) and flotillins (FLOTs) are principal proteins related to lipid rafts and have been suggested to be involved in APP processing. Here, we report that FLOT-1 binds to BACE1 (beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1) and that overexpression of CAV-1 or FLOT-1 results in recruiting BACE1 into lipid rafts and influence on beta-secretase activity in cultured cells.

Sequential proteolysis of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta- and gamma-secretases produces Abeta1-40/42, but beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), the major beta-secretase, also generates Abeta11-40/42, and BACE1 overexpression in cultured cells results primarily in secretion of Abeta11-40/42. The ratio of Abeta11-40/42 to Abeta1-40/42 depends on the ratio of BACE1 to APP, and Abeta11-40/42 can be generated from both full-length APP and its carboxy-terminal fragment (C99). Here, we investigated the role of Abeta11-40/42 in the pathogenesis of AD and Down's syndrome (DS) brains. We demonstrated significant amount of Abeta11-42 in DS brains by Western blots. While pyroAbeta11-42-modified Abeta species existed predominantly in mature SP cores in AD brain sections, both unmodified free Abeta11-40 and pyro-modified Abeta11-40 are detected in vascular amyloid deposits by immunohistochemistry. Using novel ELISAs for quantifying free Abeta11-40/42 and pyroAbeta11-40/42, we showed that insoluble Abeta11-42 predominated in extracts of AD and DS brains. This is the first systematic study of Abeta11-40/42 in neurodegenerative Abeta amyloidosis implicating Abeta11-40/42 in SP formation of AD and DS brains.

16888322,"RNA aptamers selectively modulate protein recruitment to the cytoplasmic domain of beta-secretase BACE1 in vitro.","The beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) is a major component of the Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated senile plaques and is generated by sequential cleavage of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta-secretase and gamma-secretase. Since BACE1 initiates Abeta generation it represents a valuable target to interfere with Abeta production and treatment of AD. While the enzymatic activity of BACE1 resides in the extracellular domain, the protein also contains a short cytoplasmic tail (B1-CT). This domain serves as a binding site for at least two proteins, the copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase-1 (CCS), and the Golgi-localized, gamma-ear-containing, ADP ribosylation factor-binding (GGA1) protein, and contains a single phosphorylation site. However, the precise role of the B1-CT for the overall biological function of this protein is largely unknown. Functional studies focusing on the activity of this domain would strongly benefit from the availability of domain-specific inhibitors. Here we describe the isolation and characterization of RNA aptamers that selectively target the B1-CT. We show that these RNAs bind to authentic BACE1 and provide evidence that the binding site is restricted to the membrane-proximal half of the C terminus. Aptamer-binding specifically interferes with the recruitment of CCS, but still permits GGA1 association and casein kinase-dependent phosphorylation, consistent with selective binding site targeting within this short peptide. Because phosphorylation and GGA1 binding to B1-CT regulate BACE1 transport, these RNA inhibitors could be applied to investigate B1-CT activity without affecting the subcellular localization of BACE1.","1355-8382","RNA (New York, N.Y.)","(12) 1650-60",2006,"Andrea","Rentmeister","A","LIMES Program Unit Chemical Biology & Medicinal Chemistry, Universität Bonn, 53121 Bonn, Germany."

BACE1, a membrane-bound aspartic protease that cleaves amyloid precursor protein (APP) to produce Abeta, has been implicated in triggering the pathogenesis of the disease. We previously reported that BACE1 also cleaved alpha2,6-sialyltransferase (ST6Gal I) in the Golgi apparatus and induced its secretion from the cell. Since most glycosyltransferases show Golgi localization and many of these are cleaved and secreted from the cell, we hypothesized that other glycosyltransferases may also be BACE1 substrates. Here, we focused on a series of sialyltransferases as candidates for BACE1 substrates. We found that BACE1 cleaved polysialyltransferase ST8Sia IV (PST) in vitro. We further found that BACE1 overexpression in COS cells enhanced the secretion of ST3Gal I, II, III and IV, although these sialyltransferases were not cleaved by BACE1 in vitro. These results suggest that BACE1 expression affects glycosylation not only by directly cleaving glycosyltransferases but also by modifying the secretion of glycosyltransferases via some other mechanisms.","0282-0080","Glycoconjugate journal","(23) 437-41",2006,"Shinobu","Kitazume","S","Glyco-chain Functions Laboratory, Supra-biomolecular System Group, Frontier Research System, RIKEN, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako-shi, Saitama 351-0198, Japan."

At the same time, we also examined the effect of hypoxia and reoxygenation on APP mRNA and protein levels.

In addition, the AD brain is characterized by elevated levels of fatty acids as compared to that of healthy controls. Despite this, it is unclear how elevated levels of fatty acids are related to the pathogenesis of AD. The present study examines the role of saturated fatty acid, palmitic acid (PA), in causing BACE1 upregulation and consequent amyloidogenic processing of beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP), one of the main characteristic signatures of AD pathology. Here, primary rat cortical neurons and astrocytes were treated with pathological concentration of PA. There was no change in the BACE1 levels in the rat cortical neurons treated directly with PA as compared to controls. The conditioned medium from PA-treated astrocytes, however, caused BACE1 upregulation in the cortical neurons. Moreover, there was a consequent increase in the cleavage of APP leading to the accumulation of the C-terminal fragment of APP (C99) in the cortical neurons. Co-treatment of neurons with 1,3-dimethyl urea (DMU), an antioxidant, decreased PA-induced upregulation in the levels of BACE1 and C99. The present results establish an important role of saturated fatty acids in AD-associated amyloidogenesis through astroglia-mediated oxidative stress.","0304-3940","Neuroscience letters","(406) 55-9",2006,"Sachin","Patil","S","Department of Chemical Engineering and Material Science, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI-48823, USA."

Different soluble or insoluble higher molecular weight forms of beta-amyloid peptides have been postulated to trigger a complex pathological cascade that may cause synaptic dysfunction, inflammatory processes, neuronal loss, cognitive impairment, and finally the onset of the disease. The generation of beta-amyloid peptides requires the proteolytical cleavage of APP by an aspartyl protease named beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1). The expression and enzymatic activity of BACE1 are increased in brains of AD patients. Here we discuss the importance of a number of recently identified transcription factors as well as post-transcriptional modifications and activation of intracellular signaling molecules for the regulation of BACE1 expression in brain. Importantly, some of these factors are known to be involved in the inflammatory and chronic stress responses of the brain, which are compromised during aging. Moreover, recent evidence indicates that beneficial effects of non-steriodal anti-inflammatory drugs on the progression of AD are mediated--at least in part--by effects on the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma response element present in the BACE1 promoter. The identification of the cell type-specific expression and activation of NF-kappaB, Sp1 and YY1 transcription factors may provide a basis to specifically interfere with BACE1 expression and, thereby, to lower the concentrations of beta-amyloid peptides, which may prevent neuronal cell loss and cognitive decline in AD patients.","0301-0082","Progress in neurobiology","(79) 95-111",2006,"Steffen","Rossner","S","Paul Flechsig Institute for Brain Research, Department of Neurochemistry, University of Leipzig, Jahnallee 59, 04109 Leipzig, Germany. rossn@medizin.uni-leipzig.de <rossn@medizin.uni-leipzig.de>"

Abeta is the main constituent of the amyloid core of senile plaques, a typical hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. In addition to secretases, other cellular proteolytic activities, like the proteasome, might participate in the metabolism of APP. We investigated the consequence of proteasome inhibition on the amyloidogenic processing of human APP. CHO cells and primary cultures of rat cortical neurons expressing human APP or a protein corresponding to its beta-cleaved C-terminal fragment (C99) were treated with lactacystin, an irreversible inhibitor of the chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome. Lactacystin significantly decreased the level of Abeta produced from APP in both cellular models, whereas the production of Abeta from C99 was not affected. Lactacystin did not inhibit gamma-secretase activity but was found to inhibit the beta-cleavage of APP, leading to a proportional decrease in Abeta production. Although lactacystin did not inhibit the catalytic activity of recombinant BACE1, a decrease in neuronal beta-secretase activity was measured after treatment with lactacystin.","0360-4012","Journal of neuroscience research","(84) 1311-22",2006,"Pascal","Kienlen-Campard","P","Experimental Pharmacology Unit, FARL/UCL 54 10, Université Catholique de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium."

Co-immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed a physical association between BACE1 and RTN4-B, RTN4-C (the shortest isoform of RTN-4), and their homologue reticulon 3 (RTN3), both in SH-SY5Y cells and in transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. Overexpression of these reticulons (RTNs) resulted in a 30-50% reduction in the secretion of both Abeta40 and Abeta42 from HEK293 cells expressing the AD-associated Swedish mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP), but did not affect Abeta secretion from cells expressing the APP beta-C-terminal fragment (beta-CTF), indicating that these RTNs can inhibit BACE1 activity. Furthermore, a BACE1 mutant lacking most of the N-terminal ectodomain also interacted with these RTNs, suggesting that the transmembrane region of BACE1 is critical for the interaction. We also observed a similar interaction between these RTNs and the BACE1 homologue BACE2.

However, functional interaction between PS1 and BACE1 has never been known. In addition to this classical role in the generation of Abeta peptides, it has also been proposed that PS1 affects the intracellular trafficking and maturation of selected membrane proteins. We show that the levels of exogenous and endogenous mature BACE1 expressed in presenilin-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts (PS-/-MEFs) were reduced significantly compared to those in wild-type MEFs. Moreover, the levels of mature BACE1 were increased in human neuroblastoma cell line, SH-SY5Y, stably expressing wild-type PS1, compared to native cells. Conversely, the maturation of BACE1 was compromised under the stable expression of dominant-negative mutant PS1 overexpression. Immunoprecipitation assay showed that PS1 preferably interacts with proBACE1 rather than mature BACE1, indicating that PS1 can be directly involved in the maturation process of BACE1. Further, endogenous PS1 was immunoprecipitated with endogenous BACE1 in SH-SY5Y cells and mouse brain tissue. We conclude that PS1 is directly involved in the maturation of BACE1, thus possibly functioning as a regulator of both beta- and gamma-secretase in Abeta generation.","0360-4012","Journal of neuroscience research","(85) 153-65",2007,"Akira","Kuzuya","A","Department of Neurology, Graduate School of Medicine, Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan."

17083447,"BACE1 inhibition reduces endogenous Abeta and alters APP processing in wild-type mice.","Accumulation of amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) in brain is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Inhibition of beta-site amyloid precursor protein (APP)-cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE1), the enzyme that initiates Abeta production, and other Abeta-lowering strategies are commonly tested in transgenic mice overexpressing mutant APP. However, sporadic AD cases, which represent the majority of AD patients, are free from the mutation and do not necessarily have overproduction of APP. In addition, the commonly used Swedish mutant APP alters APP cleavage. Therefore, testing Abeta-lowering strategies in transgenic mice may not be optimal. In this study, we investigated the impact of BACE1 inhibition in non-transgenic mice with physiologically relevant APP expression. Existing Abeta ELISAs are either relatively insensitive to mouse Abeta or not specific to full-length Abeta. A newly developed ELISA detected a significant reduction of full-length soluble Abeta 1-40 in mice with the BACE1 homozygous gene deletion or BACE1 inhibitor treatment, while the level of x-40 Abeta was moderately reduced due to detection of non-full-length Abeta and compensatory activation of alpha-secretase. These results confirmed the feasibility of Abeta reduction through BACE1 inhibition under physiological conditions. Studies using our new ELISA in non-transgenic mice provide more accurate evaluation of Abeta-reducing strategies than was previously feasible.","0022-3042","Journal of neurochemistry","(99) 1555-63",2006,"Kouhei","Nishitomi","K","Pain & Neurology, Discovery Research Laboratories, Shionogi Co.

Since we found that injection of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) into young mouse brains increased BACE1 expression in astrocytes, we investigated molecular mechanisms underlying this process by cloning a putative BACE1 promoter. BACE1 promoter activity was differentially regulated by IFN-gamma in a region specific manner and down-regulated by an inhibitor of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2). A dominant negative mutant of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) expression suppressed BACE1 promoter activity, and this was rescued by transfecting wild type STAT1. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and promoter activity assays indicated that STAT1 binds directly to the putative STAT1 binding sequence of BACE1 promoter. Because IFN-gamma treatment induced STAT1 phosphorylation, we examined whether the expression of a suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS), negative regulator of JAK2, suppresses BACE1 promoter activity. The results show that SOCS1 or SOCS3 expression suppressed BACE1 promoter by blocking phosphorylation of Tyr701 residue in STAT1. Also, because IFN-gamma treatment specifically potentiated extracellular signal regulated MAP kinase (ERK) 1/2 activation, pretreatment of mitogen-activated or extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitor, PD98059, significantly attenuated IFN-gamma-induced BACE1 promoter activity and protein expression through blocking phosphorylation of Ser727 residue in STAT1, suggesting that ERK1/2 is associated with IFN-gamma-induced STAT1 signaling cascade.

Although the pathogenesis of the more common late-onset AD (LOAD) is not understood, BACE1, the protease that cleaves APP to generate the N terminus of Abeta42, is more active in patients with LOAD, suggesting that increased amyloid production processing might also contribute to the sporadic disease. Using high-throughput siRNA screening technology, we assessed 15,200 genes for their role in Abeta42 secretion and identified leucine-rich repeat transmembrane 3 (LRRTM3) as a neuronal gene that promotes APP processing by BACE1. siRNAs targeting LRRTM3 inhibit the secretion of Abeta40, Abeta42, and sAPPbeta, the N-terminal APP fragment produced by BACE1 cleavage, from cultured cells and primary neurons by up to 60%, whereas overexpression increases Abeta secretion. LRRTM3 is expressed nearly exclusively in the nervous system, including regions affected during AD, such as the dentate gyrus. Furthermore, LRRTM3 maps to a region of chromosome 10 linked to both LOAD and elevated plasma Abeta42, and is structurally similar to a family of neuronal receptors that includes the NOGO receptor, an inhibitor of neuronal regeneration and APP processing. Thus, LRRTM3 is a functional and positional candidate gene for AD, and, given its receptor-like structure and restricted expression, a potential therapeutic target.","0027-8424","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","(103) 17967-72",2006,"John","Majercak","J","Department of Alzheimer's Research, Merck & Co., Inc., West Point, PA 19486, USA."

Hypoxia treatment markedly increased Abeta deposition and neuritic plaque formation and potentiated the memory deficit in Swedish mutant APP transgenic mice.

17151287,"GGA1 is expressed in the human brain and affects the generation of amyloid beta-peptide.","The beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) is a major component of Alzheimer disease (AD)-associated senile plaques and is generated by sequential cleavage of the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta-secretase (BACE1) and gamma-secretase. BACE1 cleaves APP at the N terminus of the Abeta domain, generating a membrane-bound C-terminal fragment (CTF-beta) that can be subsequently cleaved by gamma-secretase within the transmembrane domain to release Abeta. Because BACE1 initiates Abeta generation, it represents a potential target molecule to interfere with Abeta production in therapeutic strategies for AD. BACE1 interacts with Golgi-localized, gamma-ear-containing, ADP ribosylation factor-binding (GGA) proteins that are involved in the subcellular trafficking of BACE1. Here, we show that GGA1 is preferentially expressed in neurons of the human brain. GGA1 was also detected in activated microglia surrounding amyloid plaques in AD brains. Functional analyses with cultured cells demonstrate that GGA1 is implicated in the proteolytic processing of APP. Overexpression of GGA1 or a dominant-negative variant reduced cleavage of APP by BACE1 as indicated by a decrease in CTF-beta generation. Importantly, overexpression of GGA1 reduced, whereas RNAi-mediated suppression of GGA1 increased the secretion of Abeta. The modulation of APP processing by GGA1 is independent of a direct interaction of both proteins. Because total cellular activity of BACE1 was not affected by GGA1 expression, our data indicate that changes in the subcellular trafficking of BACE1 or other GGA1-dependent proteins contribute to changes in APP processing and Abeta generation. Thus, GGA proteins might be involved in the pathogenesis of AD.","1529-2401","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","(26) 12838-46",2006,"Tina","Wahle","T","Department of Neurology, University of Bonn, 53127 Bonn, Germany."

The mechanism of PKC-mediated modulation of beta-secretase activity, however, remains elusive. We report here that activation of PKC modulated beta-secretase activity through either suppressing the accumulation or promoting the translocation of BACE1 protein in a cell type-dependent manner. We found that activation of PKC suppressed the accumulation of BACE1 protein in fibroblasts through an enhancement of intracellular protease activities. In neurons, activation of PKC did not alter the expression level of BACE1, but led to more BACE1 translocated to the cell surface, resulting in a decreased cleavage of APP at the beta1 site. Together, Our findings provide novel mechanisms of PKC-mediated modulation of beta-secretase activity, suggesting that alteration of the intracellular trafficking of BACE1 may serve as a useful therapeutic strategy to lower the production of A beta in AD.","1558-1497","Neurobiology of aging","(29) 357-67",2008,"Lizhen","Wang","L","Laboratory of Neurogenetics, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892-3707, USA."

17241154,"Novel modulators of amyloid-beta precursor protein processing.","Proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is modulated by the action of enzymes alpha-, beta- and gamma-secretases, with the latter two mediating the amyloidogenic production of amyloid-beta (Abeta). Cellular modulators of APP processing are well known from studies of genetic mutations (such as those found in APP and presenilins) or polymorphisms (such as the apolipoprotein E4 epsilon-allele) that predisposes an individual to early or late-onset Alzheimer's disease. In recent years, several classes of molecule with modulating functions in APP processing and Abeta secretion have emerged. These include the neuronal Munc-18 interacting proteins (Mints)/X11s, members of the reticulon family (RTN-3 and RTN-4/Nogo-B), the Nogo-66 receptor (NgR), the peptidyl-prolyl isomerase Pin1 and the Rho family GTPases and their effectors. Mints and NgR bind to APP directly, while RTN3 and Nogo-B interact with the beta-secretase BACE1. Phosphorylated APP is a Pin1 substrate, which binds to its phosphor-Thr668-Pro motif. These interactions by and large resulted in a reduction of Abeta generation both in vitro and in vivo. Inhibition of Rho and Rho-kinase (ROCK) activity may underlie the ability of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and statins to reduce Abeta production, a feat which could also be achieved by Rac1 inhibition. Detailed understanding of the underlying mechanisms of action of these novel modulators of APP processing, as well as insights into the molecular neurological basis of how Abeta impairs leaning and memory, will open up multiple avenues for the therapeutic intervention of Alzheimer's disease.","0022-3042","Journal of neurochemistry","(100) 314-23",2007,"Bor Luen","Tang","BL","Department of Biochemistry, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Singapore. bchtbl@nus.edu.sg"

Relationship between cytokine signaling and amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) accumulation is poorly understood. Thus, we generated a novel Swedish beta-amyloid precursor protein mutant (APP) transgenic mouse in which the interferon (IFN)-gamma receptor type I was knocked out (APP/GRKO). IFN-gamma signaling loss in the APP/GRKO mice reduced gliosis and amyloid plaques at 14 months of age.

Both IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha enhanced Abeta production from APP-expressing astrocytes and cortical neurons. TNF-alpha directly stimulated beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme (BACE1) expression and enhanced beta-processing of APP in astrocytes. The numbers of reactive astrocytes expressing BACE1 were increased in APP compared with APP/GRKO mice in both cortex and hippocampus. IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha activation of WT microglia suppressed Abeta degradation, whereas GRKO microglia had no changes. These results support the idea that glial IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha enhance Abeta deposition through BACE1 expression and suppression of Abeta clearance.

However, a direct molecular link between hypoxic insults and APP processing has yet to be established. Here, we demonstrate that acute hypoxia increases the expression and the enzymatic activity of BACE1 by up-regulating the level of BACE1 mRNA, resulting in increases in the APP C-terminal fragment-beta (betaCTF) and Abeta. Hypoxia has no effect on the level of PS1, APP, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha-converting enzyme (TACE, an enzyme known to cleave APP at the alpha-secretase cleavage site).

Overexpression of HIF-1alpha increases BACE1 mRNA and protein level, whereas down-regulation of HIF-1alpha reduced the level of BACE1. Hypoxic treatment fails to further potentiate the stimulatory effect of HIF-1alpha overexpression on BACE1 expression, suggesting that hypoxic induction of BACE1 expression is primarily mediated by HIF-1alpha. Finally, we observed significant reduction in BACE1 protein levels in the hippocampus and the cortex of HIF-1alpha conditional knock-out mice.

Increased proteolytic processing and secretion of another membrane protein, the interleukin-1 receptor II (IL-1R2), have also been linked to the pathogenesis of AD. IL-1R2 is a decoy receptor that may limit detrimental effects of IL-1 in the brain. At present, the proteolytic processing of IL-1R2 remains little understood. Here we show that IL-1R2 can be proteolytically processed in a manner similar to APP. IL-1R2 expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells first undergoes ectodomain shedding in an alpha-secretase-like manner, resulting in secretion of the IL-1R2 ectodomain and the generation of an IL-1R2 C-terminal fragment. This fragment undergoes further intramembrane proteolysis by gamma-secretase, leading to the generation of the soluble intracellular domain of IL-1R2. Intramembrane cleavage of IL-1R2 was abolished by a highly specific inhibitor of gamma-secretase and was absent in mouse embryonic fibroblasts deficient in gamma-secretase activity. Surprisingly, the beta-secretase BACE1 and its homolog BACE2 increased IL-1R2 secretion resulting in C-terminal fragments nearly identical to the ones generated by the alpha-secretase-like cleavage. This suggests that both proteases may act as alternative alpha-secretase-like proteases. Importantly, BACE1 and BACE2 did not cleave several other membrane proteins, demonstrating that both proteases do not contribute to general membrane protein turnover but only cleave specific proteins. This study reveals a similar proteolytic processing of IL-1R2 and APP and may provide an explanation for the increased IL-1R2 secretion observed in AD.","0021-9258","The Journal of biological chemistry","(282) 11982-95",2007,"Peer-Hendrik","Kuhn","PH","Adolf-Butenandt-Institut, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Schillerstrasse 44, 80336 Munich, Germany."

The rat BACE1 promoter has a nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) binding site. Deletion studies with a BACE1 promoter/luciferase reporter suggest that the NF-kappaB binding DNA consensus sequence plays a suppressor role, when occupied by NF-kappaB, in the regulation of neuronal brain BACE1 expression. Here we characterize a signal transduction pathway that may be responsible for the increases in A beta associated with AD. We propose that the transcription factor NF-kappaB acts as a repressor in neurons but as an activator of BACE1 transcription in activated astrocytes present in the CNS under chronic stress, a feature present in the AD brain. The activated astrocytic stimulation of BACE1 may in part account for increased BACE1 transcription and subsequent processing of Ab eta in a cell-specific manner in the aged and AD brain. As measured by reporter gene promoter constructs and endogenous BACE1 protein expression, a functional NF-kappaB site was stimulatory in activated astrocytes and A beta-exposed neuronal cells and repressive in neuronal and nonactivated astrocytic cells. Given the evidence for increased levels of activated astrocytes in the aged brain, the age- and AD-associated increases in NF-kappaB in brain may be significant contributors to increases in A beta, acting as a positive feedback loop of chronic inflammation, astrocyte activation, increased p65/p50 activation of BACE1 transcription, and further inflammation.","0360-4012","Journal of neuroscience research","(85) 1194-204",2007,"Krystyn Z","Bourne","KZ","Department of Neuroscience and Cell Biology, University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, TX 77555-1072, USA."

Here, we show that several fibrates and diaryl heterocycle cyclooxygenase inhibitors, among them the commonly used drugs fenofibrate and celecoxib, exhibit effects similar to those of cholesterol on cellular membranes and amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing. These drugs have the same effects on membrane rigidity as cholesterol, monitored here by an increase in fluorescence anisotropy. The effect of the drugs on cellular membranes was also reflected in the inhibitory action on the sarco(endo)plasmic reticulum Ca(2+)-ATPase, which is known to be inhibited by excess ordering of membrane lipids. The drug-induced decrease of membrane fluidity correlated with an increased association of APP and its beta-site cleaving enzyme BACE1 with detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs), which represent membrane clusters of substantial rigidity. DRMs are hypothesized to serve as platforms for the amyloidogenic processing of APP. According to this hypothesis, both cholesterol and the examined compounds stimulated the beta-secretase cleavage of APP, resulting in a massive increase of secreted amyloid-beta peptides. The membrane-ordering potential of the drugs was observed in a cell-free assay, suggesting that the amyloid-beta promoting effect was analog to cholesterol due to primary effect on membrane rigidity. Because fenofibrate and celecoxib are widely used in humans as hypolipidemic drugs for prevention of atherosclerosis and as anti-inflammatory drugs against arthritis, possible side effects should be considered upon long-term clinical application.","0026-895X","Molecular pharmacology","(72) 141-51",2007,"Martin","Gamerdinger","M","Department of Pathobiochemistry, Medical School, Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany."

BACE1 levels are increased in postmortem AD brain, suggesting BACE1 elevation promotes Abeta production and AD. Alternatively, the BACE1 increase may be an epiphenomenon of late-stage AD. To distinguish between these possibilities, we analyzed BACE1 elevation using a highly specific BACE1 antibody, BACE-Cat1, made in BACE1-/- mice, which mount a robust anti-BACE1 immune response. Previous BACE1 immunohistochemical studies lack consistent results because typical BACE1 antibodies produce nonspecific background, but BACE-Cat1 immunolabels BACE1 only. BACE1 elevation was recapitulated in two amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mouse lines. 5XFAD mice form amyloid plaques at young ages and exhibit neuron loss. In contrast, Tg2576 form plaques at a more advanced age and do not show cell death. These two mouse lines allow differentiation between early Abeta-induced events and late phenomena related to neuron death. BACE1 levels became elevated in parallel with amyloid burden in each APP transgenic, starting early in 5XFAD and late in Tg2576. The increase in BACE1 protein occurred without any change in BACE1 mRNA level, indicating a posttranscriptional mechanism. In APP transgenic and AD brains, high BACE1 levels were observed in an annulus around Abeta42-positive plaque cores and colocalized with neuronal proteins. These results demonstrate that amyloid plaques induce BACE1 in surrounding neurons at early stages of pathology before neuron death occurs. We conclude that BACE1 elevation is most likely triggered by the amyloid pathway and may drive a positive-feedback loop in AD.","1529-2401","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","(27) 3639-49",2007,"Jie","Zhao","J","Department of Cell & Molecular Biology, Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, Chicago, Illinois 60611, USA."

Such an event is stimulated in the brain by the normal process of aging, and is under the control of the general aging programme mediated by the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor. In the present study we report that BACE1 is acetylated on seven lysine residues of the N-terminal portion of the nascent protein. This process involves lysine acetylation in the lumen of the ER (endoplasmic reticulum) and is followed by deacetylation in the lumen of the Golgi apparatus, once the protein is fully mature. We also show that specific enzymatic activities acetylate (in the ER) and deacetylate (in the Golgi apparatus) the lysine residues. This process requires carrier-mediated translocation of acetyl-CoA into the ER lumen and is stimulated by ceramide. Site-directed mutagenesis indicates that lysine acetylation is necessary for nascent BACE1 to leave the ER and move ahead in the secretory pathway, and for the molecular stabilization of the protein.","1470-8728","The Biochemical journal","(407) 383-95",2007,"Claudio","Costantini","C","Department of Medicine, University of Madison-Wisconsin, Madison, WI 53705, USA."

We investigated the effect of sublethal doses of mitochondrial respiratory inhibitors and potential endogenous oxidative substances on BACE expression in vivo using the retina as a model. Retinas were analyzed biochemically and anatomically 48 h following intraocular applications of mitochondrial complex I, II and IV inhibitors including rotenone, 3-nitropropionic acid and sodium azide, and plaque-containing oxidants including Fe(3+) and Abeta42 fibrils (Abeta42f). All agents caused elevations of BACE proteins and beta-site amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleavage product, beta-CTF, in retinal lysates in a dose-dependant manner. BACE activity and Abeta40 levels were also increased in agent-treated retinas relative to vehicle controls. BACE immunoreactivity in normal adult rat retina was present mostly in the plexiform layers, indicating a localization of the enzyme to synaptic terminals. No apparent change in laminar or cellular distribution of BACE labeling was detected in the experimental retinas. However, signs of neuronal stress including glial activation were observed in agent-treated retinas especially in high dosage groups. Our data suggest that mitochondrial respiratory inhibition and oxidative stress facilitate BACE expression in vivo.

An up-regulation of the protein has been described in some AD patients without a change in transcript levels. The features of BACE1 5' untranslated region (5' UTR), such as the length, GC content, evolutionary conservation and presence of upstream AUGs (uAUGs), indicate an important regulatory role of this 5' UTR in translational control. We demonstrate that, in brain and pancreas, almost all of the native BACE1 mRNA contains the full-length 5' UTR. RNA transfection and in vitro translation show that translation is mainly inhibited by the presence of the uAUGs. We provide a mutational analysis that highlight the second uAUG as the main inhibitory element while mutations of all four uAUGs fully de-repress translation.

Recent studies have shown that beta- and gamma-secretase activities of BACE1 and presenilin, respectively, are concentrated in intracellular lipid raft microdomains. However, the manner in which APP normally traffics to lipid rafts is unknown. In this study, using transient transfection and immuno-precipitation assays, we show that the cytoplasmic domain of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) interacts with APP and increases Abeta secretion and APP beta-CTF (C-terminal fragment) generation by promoting BACE1-APP interaction. We also employed discontinuous sucrose density gradient ultracentrifugation to show that the LRP cytoplasmic domain-mediated effect was accompanied by greatly increased localization of APP and BACE1 to lipid raft membranes, where beta- and gamma-secretase activities are highly enriched. Moreover, we provide evidence that endogenous LRP is required for the normal delivery of APP to lipid rafts and Abeta generation primarily in the endocytic but not secretory pathway. These results may provide novel insights to block Abeta generation by targeting LRP-mediated delivery of APP to raft microdomains.","1530-6860","FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology","(21) 2742-52",2007,"Il-Sang","Yoon","IS","Department of Neurosciences, UC San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA."

The beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) cleaves APP in an activity-dependent manner to form Abeta, AICD, and secreted APPbeta.

Here we investigated the role of this pathway in vivo. We studied transgenic mice overproducing APP that do not develop AD pathology or memory deficits but instead exhibit enhanced spatial memory. We showed enhanced synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus that depends on prior synaptic activity. We found that the enhanced memory and synaptic plasticity are abolished by the ablation of one or both copies of the BACE1 gene, leading to a significant decrease in AICD but not of any other APP cleavage products.

Here, in a proof-of-concept study, we show that immunization of transgenic AD mice (Tg2576) with memapsin 2 resulted in Abeta reduction and cognitive improvement. To study the basis of this therapy, we demonstrated that anti-memapsin 2 (anti-M2) antibodies were rapidly internalized and reduced Abeta production in cultured cells. These antibodies also effectively crossed the blood-brain barrier to reach the brain. Two- and 10-month Tg2576 mice were immunized and monitored over 10 and 6 months, respectively. We observed a significant decrease of plasma and brain Abeta40 and Abeta42 (approximately 35%) in the immunized mice as compared to controls. Immunized mice also showed better cognitive performance than controls in both cohorts. Brain histological analyses found no evidence of T cell/microglia/astrocyte activation in the immunized mice, suggesting the absence of inflammatory responses.

These mutations lead to an increased Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio that correlates with the onset of disease. However, it remains unknown how these mutations affect gamma-secretase, a protease that generates the termini of Abeta40 and Abeta42. Here we have determined the reaction mechanism of gamma-secretase with wild type and three mutated APP substrates. Our findings indicate that despite the overall outcome of an increased Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio, these mutations each display rather distinct reactivity to gamma-secretase. Intriguingly, we found that the ratio of Abeta42/Abeta40 is variable with substrate concentration; increased substrate concentrations result in higher ratios of Abeta42/Abeta40. Moreover, we demonstrated that reduction of gamma-secretase substrate concentration by BACE1 inhibition in cells decreased the Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio. This study indicates that biological factors affecting targets such as BACE1 and APP, which ultimately cause an increased concentration of gamma-secretase substrate, can augment the Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio and may play a causative role in sporadic AD.

The expression and activity of BACE1 are increased in the brains of sporadic AD patients, and a role for BACE1 in neurotransmission has been suggested recently. This study examines whether BACE1 plays a role in regulated exocytosis in PC12 cells. Treatment of PC12 cells with a beta-secretase inhibitor reduced stimulus-dependent secretion of neurotransmitters, suggesting a potential role of BACE1 in regulated exocytosis. Using transfected human growth hormone as a reporter for a regulated secretory pathway in PC12 cells, we found that the transient overexpression of BACE1 increased basal secretion in the absence of a stimulus and reduced stimulus-dependent secretion in intact PC12 cells. In digitonin-permeabilized PC12 cells, an overexpression of BACE1 enhanced the Ca2+-independent and ATP-independent component of the secretory pathway. Furthermore, expression of the glycosylation-deficient mutant of BACE1, BACE1N354Q, led to an elevation of basal secretions over that by BACE1 wild-type, suggesting a role of BACE1 glycosylation in basal secretion. These results demonstrate an unknown role for BACE1 in secretion, and suggest that elevated levels of BACE1 in AD brains may contribute to the altered neurotransmitter pathology of AD through stimulation of spontaneous basal secretion under resting conditions.","0304-3940","Neuroscience letters","(421) 178-83",2007,"Hye-Won","Lee","HW","Graduate Program in Neuroscience, Institute for Brain Science and Technology, Inje University, 633-146 Gaegeum 2 Dong, Busanjin Gu, Busan 614-735, South Korea."

The normal cellular function of the prion protein (PrP(C)), the causative agent of the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans, remains enigmatic. Because both APP and PrP(C) are subject to proteolytic processing by the same zinc metalloproteases, we tested the involvement of PrP(C) in the proteolytic processing of APP. Cellular overexpression of PrP(C) inhibited the beta-secretase cleavage of APP and reduced Abeta formation. Conversely, depletion of PrP(C) in mouse N2a cells by siRNA led to an increase in Abeta peptides secreted into the medium. In the brains of PrP knockout mice and in the brains from two strains of scrapie-infected mice, Abeta levels were significantly increased. Two mutants of PrP, PG14 and A116V, that are associated with familial human prion diseases failed to inhibit the beta-secretase cleavage of APP. Using constructs of PrP, we show that this regulatory effect of PrP(C) on the beta-secretase cleavage of APP required the localization of PrP(C) to cholesterol-rich lipid rafts and was mediated by the N-terminal polybasic region of PrP(C) via interaction with glycosaminoglycans. In conclusion, this is a mechanism by which the cellular production of the neurotoxic Abeta is regulated by PrP(C) and may have implications for both Alzheimer's and prion diseases.","1091-6490","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","(104) 11062-7",2007,"Edward T","Parkin","ET","Proteolysis Research Group, Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Faculty of Biological Sciences, and Leeds Institute of Genetics, Health and Therapeutics, University of Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, United Kingdom."

Similarly, endogenous beta2 processing and Na(v)1.1 protein levels are elevated in brains of BACE1-transgenic mice and Alzheimer's disease patients with high BACE1 levels. However, Na(v)1.1 is retained inside the cells and cell surface expression of the Na(v)1 alpha-subunits and sodium current densities are markedly reduced in both neuroblastoma cells and adult hippocampal neurons from BACE1-transgenic mice.

In addition, they developed parenchymal amyloid in cortex and subiculum. In contrast, APPDutch/G384A-PS1 mice showed extensive, predominantly parenchymal amyloid throughout the entire brain, interestingly, even in the thalamus. The amyloid, composed largely of AbetaDutch42, was different compared to that in APPDutch/BACE1 mice which was composed mainly of AbetaDutch40. In summary, these mouse models reveal a broad variety and region-specificity of parenchymal versus vascular cerebral amyloid. This is partially explained by the absolute amount of neuronally produced AbetaDutch42 and AbetaDutch40 and ratio between the two. We conclude that the absolute levels of Abeta in combination with the ratio of Abeta42 to Abeta40 play a key role in determining the cerebral compartment and brain region in which Abeta is deposited.","1660-2854","Neuro-degenerative diseases","(4) 127-35",2007,"Martin C","Herzig","MC","Department of Cellular Neurology, Hertie-Institute for Clinical Brain Research, University of Tübingen, Tübingen, Germany. martin.herzig@uni-tuebingen.de"

The production of Abeta requires two sequential cleavages induced by beta- and gamma-secretases on the beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP). Altered activity of these secretases is involved in the pathogenesis of AD. The expression and activity of beta-secretase (BACE1) is augmented in the brain in late-onset sporadic AD. Mutant presenilin 1 (PS1), the major genetic defect of early-onset familial AD (FAD), alters the activity of gamma-secretase, leading to increased production of Abeta42. Here we review the role of oxidative stress as a molecular link between the beta- and the gamma-secretase activities, and provide a mechanistic explanation of the pathogenesis of sporadic late-onset AD. We also discuss evidence for a role of the same mechanism in the pathogenesis of familial AD carrying PS1 mutations.","1420-682X","Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS","(64) 2211-8",2007,"M","Tabaton","M","Department of Neurosciences, Ophthalmology and Genetics, University of Genoa, Via De Toni 2, 16132, Genoa, Italy. mtabaton@neurologia.unige.it"

To determine the role that BACE1 plays in the development of Abeta-driven AD-like pathology, we have crossed PDAPP mice, a transgenic mouse model of AD overexpressing human mutated APP, onto mice with either a homozygous or heterozygous BACE1 gene knockout. Analysis of PDAPP/BACE(-/-) mice demonstrated that BACE1 is absolutely required for both Abeta generation and the development of age-associated plaque pathology. Furthermore, synaptic deficits, a neurodegenerative pathology characteristic of AD, were also reversed in the bigenic mice. To determine the extent of BACE1 reduction required to significantly inhibit pathology, PDAPP mice having a heterozygous BACE1 gene knock-out were evaluated for Abeta generation and for the development of pathology. Although the 50% reduction in BACE1 enzyme levels caused only a 12% decrease in Abeta levels in young mice, it nonetheless resulted in a dramatic reduction in Abeta plaques, neuritic burden, and synaptic deficits in older mice. Quantitative analyses indicate that brain Abeta levels in young APP transgenic mice are not the sole determinant for the changes in plaque pathology mediated by reduced BACE1. These observations demonstrate that partial reductions of BACE1 enzyme activity and concomitant Abeta levels lead to dramatic inhibition of Abeta-driven AD-like pathology, making BACE1 an excellent target for therapeutic intervention in AD.","0021-9258","The Journal of biological chemistry","(282) 26326-34",2007,"Lisa","McConlogue","L","Department of Biology, Elan Pharmaceuticals, South San Francisco, California 94080, USA. lisa.mcconlogue@elan.com"

However, the biological consequence of BACE1 processing of beta4 remains illusive. Here, we report the biological effects of beta4 processing by BACE1. Overexpression of beta4 in Neuro2a cells promoted neurite extension and increased the number of F-actin rich filopodia-like protrusions. While coexpression of BACE1 together with beta4 further accelerated neurite extension, the number of filopodia-like protrusions was reduced. Overexpression of C-terminal fragment of beta4 that was generated by BACE1 (beta4-CTF) partially recapitulated the results obtained with BACE1 overexpression. These results suggest that the processing of beta4 by BACE1 regulates neurite length and filopodia-like protrusion density in neurons.","0006-291X","Biochemical and biophysical research communications","(361) 43-8",2007,"Haruko","Miyazaki","H","Laboratory for Structural Neuropathology, RIKEN Brain Science Institute, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako-shi, Saitama 351-0198, Japan."

It is generally accepted that drugs that can regulate the processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) toward the non-amyloidogenic pathway may have a therapeutic potential. Previous studies have shown that protein kinase C (PKC) hypofunction has an important role in AD pathophysiology. Therefore, the effects of a new PKC activator, alpha-APP modulator [(2S,5S)-(E,E)-8-(5-(4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-2,4-pentadienoylamino)benzolactam (TPPB)], on APP processing were investigated. Using PC12 cells and SH-SY5Y(APP695) cells, it was found that TPPB promoted the secretion of sAPPalpha without affecting full-length expression of APP. The increase in sAPPalpha by TPPB was blocked by inhibitors of PKC, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and tyrosine kinase, suggesting the involvement of these signal transduction pathways. TPPB increased alpha-secretase activity [a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM)10 and 17], as shown by direct fluorescence activity detection and Western blot analysis. TPPB-induced sAPPalpha release was blocked by the metalloproteinase inhibitor TAPI-2, furin inhibitor CMK and by the protein-trafficking inhibitor brefeldin. The results also showed that TPPB decreased beta-secretase activity, Abeta40 release and beta site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) expression, but did not significantly affect neprilysin (NEP) and insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) expression. Our data indicate that TPPB could direct APP processing towards the non-amyloidogenic pathway by increasing alpha-secretase activity, and suggest its therapeutic potential in AD.","0953-816X","The European journal of neuroscience","(26) 381-91",2007,"Hong-Qi","Yang","HQ","Department of Neurology and Institute of Neurology, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai JiaoTong University School of Medicine, Shanghai 200025, P.R.

We studied Nogo-B and Nogo-A in s-IBM muscle and in our IBM muscle culture models, based on A beta PP-overexpression or ER-stress-induction in cultured human muscle fibers (CHMFs). We report that: (1) in biopsied s-IBM fibers, Nogo-B is increased, accumulates in aggregates, is immuno-co-localized with BACE1, and binds to BACE1; Nogo-A is undetectable.

Accordingly, two novel mechanisms, A beta PP overexpression and ER stress, are involved in Nogo-B and Nogo-A expression in human muscle. We propose that in s-IBM muscle the Nogo-B increase may represent an attempt by muscle fiber to decrease A beta production. However, the increase of Nogo-B seems insufficient because A beta continues to accumulate and the disease progresses.

Here, we found that BACE1 overexpression in Hep3B cells increased the sialylation of soluble secreted glycoproteins, but did not affect cell-surface sialylation. The sialylation of soluble glycoproteins was not increased by ST6Gal I overexpression alone, but was increased by co-overexpression of ST6Gal I and BACE1 or by expression of the soluble form of ST6Gal I, suggesting that soluble ST6Gal I produced by BACE1 plays, at least in part, a role in the sialylation of soluble glycoproteins. We also found that plasma glycoproteins from BACE1-deficient mice exhibited reduced levels of alpha2,6-sialylation compared with those from wild-type mice.

The beta-secretase APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) has become a target of intense research aimed at blocking the enzyme activity. Recent studies showed that BACE1 is involved in processing other non-APP substrates, and that other proteases are involved in APP processing. We have recently established a novel approach to inhibit Abeta production via antibodies against the beta-secretase cleavage site of APP. These antibodies bind wild type and Swedish mutated APP expressed in transgenic mice brain tissues. The isolated antibodies do not bind any form of Abeta peptides. Antibody up-take experiments, using Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing wild-type APP, suggest that antibody internalization and trafficking are mediated via the endocytic pathway. Administration of antibodies to the cells growing media resulted in a considerable decrease in intracellular Abeta levels, as well as in the levels of the corresponding C-terminal fragment (C99). The relevance of intra-neuronal accumulation of mainly Abeta42 as an early event in AD pathogenesis suggests that this approach may be applicable as a novel therapeutic strategy in AD treatment.","1567-2050","Current Alzheimer research","(4) 437-45",2007,"Michal","Arbel","M","Department of Molecular Microbiology & Biotechnology, George S Wise Faculty of Life Sciences, Tel-Aviv University, Ramat Aviv, Tel-Aviv, Israel."

While several pathologies characterize this disease, amyloid plaques, composed of the beta-amyloid peptide are hallmark neuropathological lesions in Alzheimer's disease brain. Indeed, a wealth of evidence suggests that beta-amyloid is central to the pathophysiology of AD and is likely to play an early role in this intractable neurodegenerative disorder. The BACE1 enzyme is essential for the generation of beta-amyloid. BACE1 knockout mice do not produce beta-amyloid and are free from Alzheimer's associated pathologies including neuronal loss and certain memory deficits. The fact that BACE1 initiates the formation of beta-amyloid, and the observation that BACE1 levels are elevated in this disease provide direct and compelling reasons to develop therapies directed at BACE1 inhibition thus reducing beta-amyloid and its associated toxicities. However, new data indicates that complete abolishment of BACE1 may be associated with specific behavioral and physiological alterations. Recently a number of non-APP BACE1 substrates have been identified. It is plausible that failure to process certain BACE1 substrates may underlie some of the reported abnormalities in the BACE1-deficient mice. Here we review BACE1 biology, covering aspects ranging from the initial identification and characterization of this enzyme to recent data detailing the apparent dysregulation of BACE1 in Alzheimer's disease. We pay special attention to the putative function of BACE1 during healthy conditions and discuss in detail the relationship that exists between key risk factors for AD, such as vascular disease (and downstream cellular consequences), and the pathogenic alterations in BACE1 that are observed in the diseased state.","1750-1326","Molecular neurodegeneration","(2) 22",2007,"Sarah L","Cole","SL","Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, The Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago Avenue, Chicago, IL, USA. r-vassar@northwestern.edu."

IL-1beta did not significantly alter the mRNA levels of BACE1, ADAM-9, and ADAM-10, but up-regulated that of TACE by threefold. The proform and mature form of TACE protein were also significantly up-regulated. A TACE inhibitor (TAPI-2) concomitantly reversed the IL-1beta-dependent increase in sAPPalpha and decrease in sAPPbeta, suggesting that APP consumption in the alpha-cleavage pathway reduced its consumption in the beta-cleavage pathway. IL-1Ra, a physiological antagonist for the IL-1 receptor, reversed the effects of IL-1beta, suggesting that the IL-1beta-dependent up-regulation of alpha-cleavage is mediated by the IL-1 receptor. IL-1beta also induced this concomitant increase in alpha-cleavage and decrease in beta-cleavage in mouse primary cultured neurons.

Two presenilin (PS) homologues, referred to as PS1 and PS2, comprise the catalytic core of gamma-secretase. In comparing presenilin selectivity of several classes of gamma-secretase inhibitors, we observed that sulfonamides in general tend to be more selective for inhibition of PS1-comprising gamma-secretase, as exemplified by ELN318463 and BMS299897. We employed a combination of chimeric constructs and point mutants to identify structural determinants for PS1-selective inhibition by ELN318463. Our studies identified amino acid residues Leu(172), Thr(281), and Leu(282) in PS1 as necessary for PS1-selective inhibition by ELN318463. These residues also contributed in part to the PS1-selective inhibition by BMS299897. Alanine scanning mutagenesis of areas flanking Leu(172), Thr(281), and Leu(282) identified additional amino acids that affect inhibitor potency of not only these sulfonamides but also nonsulfonamide inhibitors, without affecting Abeta production and presenilin endoproteolysis. Interestingly, many of these same residues have been identified previously to be important for gamma-secretase function. These findings implicate TM3 and a second region near the carboxyl terminus of PS1 aminoterminal fragment in mediating the activity of gamma-secretase inhibitors.

Mutated human APP transgenes result in the deposition of Abeta peptide, similar but not identical to the Abeta peptide of human senile plaque. Amyloid angiopathy is common. Besides the deposition of Abeta, axon dystrophy and alteration of dendrites have been observed. All of the mutations cause an increase in Abeta 42 levels, except for the Arctic mutation, which alters the Abeta sequence itself. Overexpressing wild-type APP alone (as in the murine models of human trisomy 21) causes no Abeta deposition in most mouse lines. Doubly (APP x mutated PS1) transgenic mice develop the lesions earlier. Transgenic mice in which BACE1 has been knocked out or overexpressed have been produced, as well as lines with altered expression of neprilysin, the main degrading enzyme of Abeta. The APP transgenic mice have raised new questions concerning the mechanisms of neuronal loss, the accumulation of Abeta in the cell body of the neurons, inflammation and gliosis, and the dendritic alterations. They have allowed some insight to be gained into the kinetics of the changes. The connection between the symptoms, the lesions and the increase in Abeta oligomers has been found to be difficult to unravel. Neurofibrillary tangles are only found in mouse lines that overexpress mutated tau or human tau on a murine tau -/- background.

Because both AD and aging are associated with disrupted calcium homeostasis, we investigated the role of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) - a transcription factor regulated by the calcium- and calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin - in BACE1 expression. BACE1 expression was stimulated by a calcium ionophore in primary cortical cultures, and by SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, which was both blocked by pretreatment with either cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of calcineurin, or ethyleneglycotetraacetic acid, a calcium chelator. Gel shift assays revealed direct binding of NFAT1 to specific DNA sequences within the BACE1 gene promoter region. Treatment with amyloid beta (Abeta), one of the major factors in AD pathogenesis, stimulated activation and nuclear translocation of NFAT1 following up-regulation of BACE1 expression. In addition, primary cortical cultures from Tg2576 mouse brains generated more Abeta by ionophore stimulation, which was reversed by cyclosporin A treatment. Furthermore, NFAT1 activation was observed in Tg2576 mouse brains. These results suggest that calcium ionophore- or Abeta-induced increases in intracellular calcium concentration stimulate BACE1 expression, resulting in accelerated Abeta generation, and that this process is mediated through the calcineurin-NFAT1 signaling pathway.

18156464,"In vivo beta-secretase 1 inhibition leads to brain Abeta lowering and increased alpha-secretase processing of amyloid precursor protein without effect on neuregulin-1.","beta-Secretase (BACE) cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) is one of the first steps in the production of amyloid beta peptide Abeta42, the putative neurotoxic species in Alzheimer's disease. Recent studies have shown that BACE1 knockdown leads to hypomyelination, putatively caused by a decline in neuregulin (NRG)-1 processing. In this study, we have tested a potent cell-permeable BACE1 inhibitor (IC(50) approximately 30 nM) by administering it directly into the lateral ventricles of mice, expressing human wild-type (WT)-APP, to determine the consequences of BACE1 inhibition on brain APP and NRG-1 processing. BACE1 inhibition, in vivo, led to a significant dose- and time-dependent lowering of brain Abeta40 and Abeta42. BACE1 inhibition also led to a robust brain secreted (s)APPbeta lowering that was accompanied by an increase in brain sAPPalpha levels. Although an increase in full-length NRG-1 levels was evident in 15-day-old BACE1 homozygous knockout (KO) (-/-) mice, in agreement with previous studies, this effect was also observed in 15-day-old heterozygous (+/-) mice, but it was not evident in 30-day-old and 2-year-old BACE1 KO (-/-) mice. Thus, BACE1 knockdown led to a transient decrease in NRG-1 processing in mice. Pharmacological inhibition of BACE1 in adult mice, which led to significant Abeta lowering, was without any significant effect on brain NRG-1 processing. Taken together, these results suggest that BACE1 is the major beta-site cleavage enzyme for APP and that its inhibition can lower brain Abeta and redirect APP processing via the potentially nonamyloidogenic alpha-secretase pathway, without significantly altering NRG-1 processing.","1521-0103","The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics","(324) 957-69",2008,"Sethu","Sankaranarayanan","S","Department of Alzheimer's Research, WP 26A-2000, Merck Research Laboratories, 770, Sumneytown Pike, West Point, PA 19486, USA."
18163181,"Protein expression of BACE1, BACE2 and APP in Down syndrome brains.","Down syndrome (DS) is the most common human chromosomal abnormality caused by an extra copy of chromosome 21. The phenotype of DS is thought to result from overexpression of a gene or genes located on the triplicated chromosome or chromosome region. Several reports have shown that the neuropathology of DS comprises developmental abnormalities and Alzheimer-like lesions such as senile plaques. A key component of senile plaques is amyloid beta-peptide which is generated from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential action of beta-secretases (BACE1 and BACE2) and gamma-secretase. While BACE1 maps to chromosome 11, APP and BACE2 are located on chromosome 21. To challenge the gene dosage effect and gain insight into the expressional relation between beta-secretases and APP in DS brain, we evaluated protein expression levels of BACE1, BACE2 and APP in fetal and adult DS brain compared to controls. In fetal brain, protein expression levels of BACE2 and APP were comparable between DS and controls. BACE1 was increased, but did not reach statistical significance. In adult brain, BACE1 and BACE2 were comparable between DS and controls, but APP was significantly increased. We conclude that APP overexpression seems to be absent during the development of DS brain up to 18-19 weeks of gestational age. However, its overexpression in adult DS brain could lead to disturbance of normal function of APP contributing to neurodegeneration. Comparable expression of BACE1 and BACE2 speaks against the hypothesis that increased beta-secretase results in (or even underlies) increased production of amyloidogenic A beta fragments. Furthermore, current data indicate that the DS phenotype cannot be fully explained by simple gene dosage effect.","1438-2199","Amino acids","(35) 339-43",2008,"M S","Cheon","MS","Department of Pediatrics, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria."

Recent studies in rodents have shown that exposure to lead (Pb) during brain development predetermined the expression and regulation of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its amyloidogenic beta-amyloid (Abeta) product in old age. Here, we report that the expression of AD-related genes [APP, BACE1 (beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1)] as well as their transcriptional regulator (Sp1) were elevated in aged (23-year-old) monkeys exposed to Pb as infants. Furthermore, developmental exposure to Pb altered the levels, characteristics, and intracellular distribution of Abeta staining and amyloid plaques in the frontal association cortex. These latent effects were accompanied by a decrease in DNA methyltransferase activity and higher levels of oxidative damage to DNA, indicating that epigenetic imprinting in early life influenced the expression of AD-related genes and promoted DNA damage and pathogenesis. These data suggest that AD pathogenesis is influenced by early life exposures and argue for both an environmental trigger and a developmental origin of AD.","1529-2401","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","(28) 3-9",2008,"Jinfang","Wu","J","Department of Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Rhode Island, Kingston, Rhode Island 02881, USA."

The multifactorial nature of complex diseases suggests the alternative of examining gene-gene interactions (epistasis) within biological networks. We have used synergy factor analysis to assess over 100 claims of epistasis in sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD), in networks involving, e.g. cholesterol, beta-amyloid, inflammation and oxidative stress. We found 27 gene-gene interactions that were significantly associated with AD. In most of these the main effect of one of the genes was so small that it would probably have been missed by the traditional locus-by-locus approach. There are questions, however, about the quality of replication studies: about sample sizes, about homogeneity, characterization and matching of sample sets, and about the statistical methods commonly used to assess interactions. Meta-analyses could now be conducted of the four interactions that have been sufficiently replicated, all involving APOE4: ACT -17AA; BACE1 exon5 GG; IL6 -174C; BCHE K. Only that between BACE1 exon5 GG and APOE4 has so far been consistently replicated.

However, little is understood about the role(s) of miRNAs in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We used miRNA expression microarrays on RNA extracted from human brain tissue from the University of Kentucky Alzheimer's Disease Center Brain Bank with near-optimal clinicopathological correlation. Cases were separated into four groups: elderly nondemented with negligible AD-type pathology, nondemented with incipient AD pathology, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) with moderate AD pathology, and AD. Among the AD-related miRNA expression changes, miR-107 was exceptional because miR-107 levels decreased significantly even in patients with the earliest stages of pathology. In situ hybridization with cross-comparison to neuropathology demonstrated that particular cerebral cortical laminas involved by AD pathology exhibit diminished neuronal miR-107 expression. Computational analysis predicted that the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) mRNA is targeted multiply by miR-107. From the same RNA material analyzed on miRNA microarrays, mRNA expression profiling was performed using Affymetrix Exon Array microarrays on nondemented, MCI, and AD patients. BACE1 mRNA levels tended to increase as miR-107 levels decreased in the progression of AD. Cell culture reporter assays performed with a subset of the predicted miR-107 binding sites indicate the presence of at least one physiological miR-107 miRNA recognition sequence in the 3'-UTR of BACE1 mRNA. Together, the coordinated application of miRNA profiling, Affymetrix microarrays, new bioinformatics predictions, in situ hybridization, and biochemical validation indicate that miR-107 may be involved in accelerated disease progression through regulation of BACE1.","1529-2401","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","(28) 1213-23",2008,"Wang-Xia","Wang","WX","Sanders-Brown Center on Aging, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky 40536, USA."

Female ICR mice were ovariectomized or sham-operated, and then randomly divided into a daily restraint stress (21 days, 6 h/day) or non-stress group. Although OVX or stress alone did not affect beta-site amyloid precursor protein (APP)-cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE1) activity, OVX/stress increased activity in hippocampal CA1 and CA3 regions, compared with other groups. In contrast, OVX/stress did not affect gamma-secretase activity, Abeta(1-40), and phosphorylated-tau levels in the hippocampus. These findings suggest that a stressful life after menopause can influence the levels of AD-related molecules and that BACE1 is the most sensitive molecule for such a situation.","0304-3940","Neuroscience letters","(433) 141-5",2008,"Emiko","Fukuzaki","E","Laboratory of Neuropsychopharmacology, Graduate School of Natural Science and Technology, Kanazawa University, Kanazawa 920-1192, Japan."

Oxidative stress up-regulates the expression and the activity of BACE1 in cellular and animal models, through a mechanism that involves the increase of gamma-secretase cleavage on APP and the activation of c-jun N-terminal kinase/activator protein 1 (JNK/AP1) pathway. We further characterized the cellular pathways that control BACE1 expression under oxidative stress. We investigated the involvement of extracellular signal regulated MAP kinase (ERK1/2) pathway in the regulation of BACE1 expression, since it has been recently shown that ERK1/2 is an endogenous regulator of the gamma-secretase activity. We found that ERK1/2 pathway negatively modulates BACE1 expression and activity. Moreover, we observed that conditions that abrogate the gamma-secretase activity favor the activation of signalling pathways that promote cell survival, such as ERK1/2 and the serine/threonine kinase Akt/protein kinase B (Akt). These data suggest that the positive or negative cellular responses to oxidative stress parallel the activities of the beta- and the gamma-secretase. ERK1/2 and JNK pathways are involved in this bipartite response, which can lead to neurodegeneration or neuroprotection depending on the cellular and environmental conditions or cooperation with other signalling pathways such as Akt cascade.","1558-1497","Neurobiology of aging","(30) 1563-73",2009,"Elena","Tamagno","E","Department of Experimental Medicine and Oncology, University of Turin, Turin, Italy. elena.tamagno@unito.it"

18263584,"NFkappaB-dependent control of BACE1 promoter transactivation by Abeta42.","Beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides that accumulate in Alzheimer disease are generated from the beta-amyloid precursor protein (betaAPP) by cleavages by beta-secretase BACE1 and by presenilin-dependent gamma-secretase activities. Very few data document a putative cross-talk between these proteases and the regulatory mechanisms underlying such interaction. We show that presenilin deficiency lowers BACE1 maturation and affects both BACE1 activity and promoter transactivation. The specific gamma-secretase inhibitor DFK167 triggers the decrease of BACE1 activity in wild-type but not in presenilin-deficient fibroblasts. This decrease is also elicited by catalytically inactive gamma-secretase. The overexpression of APP intracellular domain (AICD), the gamma/epsilon-secretase-derived C-terminal product of beta-amyloid precursor protein, does not modulate BACE1 activity or promoter transactivation in fibroblasts and does not alter BACE1 expression in AICD transgenic brains of mice. A DFK167-sensitive increase of BACE1 activity is observed in cells overexpressing APPepsilon (the N-terminal product of betaAPP generated by epsilon-secretase cleavage harboring the Abeta domain but lacking the AICD sequence), suggesting that the production of Abeta could account for the modulation of BACE1. Accordingly, we show that HEK293 cells overexpressing wild-type betaAPP exhibit a DFK167-sensitive increase in BACE1 promoter transactivation that is increased by the Abeta-potentiating Swedish mutation. This effect was mimicked by exogenous application of Abeta42 but not Abeta40 or by transient transfection of cDNA encoding Abeta42 sequence. The IkappaB kinase inhibitor BMS345541 prevents Abeta-induced BACE1 promoter transactivation suggesting that NFkappaB could mediate this Abeta-associated phenotype. Accordingly, the overexpression of wild-type or Swedish mutated betaAPP does not modify the transactivation of BACE1 promoter constructs lacking NFkappaB-responsive element. Furthermore, APP/beta-amyloid precursor protein-like protein deficiency does not affect BACE1 activity and expression. Overall, these data suggest that physiological levels of endogenous Abeta are not sufficient per se to modulate BACE1 promoter transactivation but that exacerbated Abeta production linked to wild-type or Swedish mutated betaAPP overexpression modulates BACE1 promoter transactivation and activity via an NFkappaB-dependent pathway.","0021-9258","The Journal of biological chemistry","(283) 10037-47",2008,"Virginie","Buggia-Prevot","V","Institut de Pharmacologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire, UMR 6097 CNRS/UNSA, Equipe Labellisée Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale, 06560 Valbonne, France."

However, it may be possible to target other regions of the protein which regulate BACE1 allosterically. We have found that proBACE1 can be stimulated by relatively low concentrations (e.g. 1 microg/ml) of heparin. Heparin initially increases proBACE1 activity, probably by binding to the prodomain, which decreases steric inhibition at the active site. However, the heparin-activated zymogen also undergoes autocatalysis, which ultimately leads to a loss of enzyme activity. We speculate that proBACE1 can be regulated by endogenous heparan sulfate proteoglycans and that drugs which target this interaction may have value in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.","1660-2862","Neuro-degenerative diseases","(5) 206-8",2008,"David H","Small","DH","Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Monash University, Clayton, Vic., Australia. d.h.small@menzies.utas.edu.au"

To test this hypothesis, we analyze the behaviors considered to be rodent analogs of clinical features of schizophrenia in BACE1(-/-) mice with impaired processing of NRG1. We demonstrate that BACE1(-/-) mice exhibit deficits in prepulse inhibition, novelty-induced hyperactivity, hypersensitivity to a glutamatergic psychostimulant (MK-801), cognitive impairments, and deficits in social recognition. Importantly, some of these manifestations were responsive to treatment with clozapine, an atypical antipsychotic drug. Moreover, although the total amount of ErbB4, a receptor for NRG1 was not changed, binding of ErbB4 with postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) was significantly reduced in the brains of BACE1(-/-) mice. Consistent with the role of ErbB4 in spine morphology and synaptic function, BACE1(-/-) mice displayed reduced spine density in hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Collectively, our findings suggest that alterations in BACE1-dependent NRG1/ErbB4 signaling may participate in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and related psychiatric disorders.","1091-6490","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","(105) 5585-90",2008,"A V","Savonenko","AV","Departments of Pathology, Neurology, and Neuroscience, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, 558 Ross Research Building, 720 Rutland Avenue, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA."
18387811,"Homer2 and Homer3 interact with amyloid precursor protein and inhibit Abeta production.","The study of Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) processing has been the focus of considerable interest, since it leads to Abeta peptide generation, the main constituent of neuritic plaques found in brains of Alzheimer's disease patients. Therefore, the identification of novel APP binding partners that regulate Abeta peptide production represents a pharmaceutical target aiming at reducing Alphabeta pathology. In this study, we provide evidence that Homer2 and Homer3 but not Homer1 proteins interact specifically with APP. Their expression inhibits APP processing and reduces secretion of Abeta peptides. In addition, they decrease the levels of cell surface APP and inhibit maturation of APP and beta-secretase (BACE1). The effects of Homer2 and Homer3 on APP trafficking to the cell surface and/or on APP and BACE1 maturation could be part of the mechanism by which the expression of these proteins leads to the significant reduction of Abeta peptide production.","1095-953X","Neurobiology of disease","(30) 353-364",2008,"Loukia","Parisiadou","L","Division of Animal and Human Physiology, Department of Biology, National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, 157 84 Panepistimiopolis, Ilisia, Athens, Greece."
18393796,"BACE1 structure and function in health and Alzheimer's disease.","Amyloid plaques, hallmark neuropathological lesions in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain, are composed of the beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta). Much evidence suggests that Abeta is central to the pathophysiology of AD and is likely to play an early role in this intractable neurodegenerative disorder. Given the strong correlation between Abeta and AD, therapeutic strategies to lower cerebral Abeta levels should prove beneficial for AD treatment. Abeta is derived from amyloid precursor protein (APP) via cleavage by two proteases, beta- and gamma-secretase. The beta-secretase has been identified as a novel aspartic protease named BACE1 (beta-site APP Cleaving Enzyme 1) that initiates Abeta formation. Importantly, BACE1 appears to be dysregulated in AD. As the rate-limiting enzyme in Abeta generation, BACE1, in principle, is an excellent therapeutic target for strategies to reduce the production of Abeta in AD. While BACE1 knockout (BACE1-/-) mice have been instrumental in validating BACE1 as the authentic beta-secretase in vivo, data indicates that complete abolishment of BACE1 may be associated with specific behavioral and physiological alterations. Recently a number of non-APP BACE1 substrates have been identified. It is plausible that failure to process certain BACE1 substrates may underlie some of the reported abnormalities in the BACE1-/- mice. Here we review the basic biology of BACE1, focusing on the regulation, structure and function of this enzyme. We pay special attention to the putative function of BACE1 during normal conditions and discuss in detail the relationship that exists between key risk factors for AD and the pathogenic alterations in BACE1 that are observed in the diseased state.","1567-2050","Current Alzheimer research","(5) 100-20",2008,"Sarah L","Cole","SL","Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, The Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago Avenue, Chicago, IL, USA."

Experimental thiamine deficiency (TD) is an established model for reducing the activities of thiamine-dependent enzymes in brain. TD diminishes thiamine-dependent enzymes throughout the brain, but produces a time-dependent selective neuronal loss, glial activation, inflammation, abnormalities in oxidative metabolism and clusters of degenerating neurites in only specific thalamic regions. The present studies tested how TD alters brain pathology in Tg19959 transgenic mice over expressing a double mutant form of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). TD exacerbated amyloid plaque pathology in transgenic mice and enlarged the area occupied by plaques in cortex, hippocampus and thalamus by 50%, 200% and 200%, respectively. TD increased Abeta(1-42) levels by about three fold, beta-CTF (C99) levels by 33% and beta-secretase (BACE1) protein levels by 43%. TD-induced inflammation in areas of plaque formation. Thus, the induction of mild impairment of oxidative metabolism, oxidative stress and inflammation induced by TD alters metabolism of APP and/or Abeta and promotes accumulation of plaques independent of neuron loss or neuritic clusters.","1558-1497","Neurobiology of aging","(30) 1587-600",2009,"Saravanan S","Karuppagounder","SS","Department of Neurology and Neurosciences, Weill Medical College of Cornell University, Burke Medical Research Institute, 785 Mamaroneck Avenue, White Plains, NY 10605, USA."
18413858,"Genetic deletion of BACE1 in mice affects remyelination of sciatic nerves.","BACE1 is a promising therapeutic and preventive target for Alzheimer's disease because it is essential for amyloid deposition. However, the recent demonstration of BACE1 in modulating developmental myelination in both peripheral and central nervous systems raises a concern of its effect on myelin maintenance or remyelination, and inhibition of these processes will potentially be detrimental to the BACE1 inhibitor users who are susceptible to myelination diseases such as adult peripheral nerve injury or multiple sclerosis. In this report, we investigated the role of BACE1 during peripheral nerve remyelination in wild-type (WT) and BACE1-null mice. We show here that genetic deletion of BACE1 affects sciatic nerve remyelination. The impaired remyelination appears to stem from the loss of neuregulin-1 cleavage by BACE1. To demonstrate a direct cleavage of neuregulin-1 by BACE1, we have identified a BACE1 cleavage site that turns out be highly conserved among neuregulin-1 paralogues. Moreover, we show that neuregulin-1 family member neuregulin-3 is also cleavable by BACE1. We hypothesize that the BACE1-cleaved extracellular domain of axonal neuregulin-1, perhaps neuregulin-3 as well, binds to Schwann cell ErbB receptors, which in turn regulate remyelination. Pharmacological inhibition of BACE1 should be carefully monitored to avoid alteration of signaling pathway that regulates remyelination.","1530-6860","FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology","(22) 2970-80",2008,"Xiangyou","Hu","X","Department of Neurosciences, Lerner Research Institute, The Cleveland Clinic Foundation, 9500 Euclid Ave., Cleveland, OH 44195, USA."

Deficiency in Abeta clearance is certainly a possibility, but increased expression of proteins like APP or BACE1/beta-secretase may also be associated with the disease. We therefore investigated changes in microRNA (miRNA) expression profiles of sporadic AD patients and found that several miRNAs potentially involved in the regulation of APP and BACE1 expression appeared to be decreased in diseased brain. We show here that miR-29a, -29b-1, and -9 can regulate BACE1 expression in vitro. The miR-29a/b-1 cluster was significantly (and AD-dementia-specific) decreased in AD patients displaying abnormally high BACE1 protein. Similar correlations between expression of this cluster and BACE1 were found during brain development and in primary neuronal cultures. Finally, we provide evidence for a potential causal relationship between miR-29a/b-1 expression and Abeta generation in a cell culture model. We propose that loss of specific miRNAs can contribute to increased BACE1 and Abeta levels in sporadic AD.","1091-6490","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","(105) 6415-20",2008,"Sébastien S","Hébert","SS","Center for Human Genetics, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven and Department of Molecular and Developmental Genetics, VIB, Herestraat 49 bus 602, B-3000 Leuven, Belgium."

We found that synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (dex) potently increased the promoter activity of NMDA1 and 2A subunit genes, but did not stimulate those of Alzheimer disease-related genes. The similar effect of dex was observed on intrinsic NMDA1 mRNA and protein expression. Furthermore, dex showed synergistic and additive effects with protein kinase A- and C-mediated signaling pathways, respectively. Finally, treatment of the Neuro2A cells, which express intrinsic glucocorticoid receptor, with dex significantly enhanced the glutamate-induced neurotoxicity. Our results suggest that glucocorticoid-induced neuronal damage may be, at least partly, attributable to enhanced expression of glutamate NMDA receptor with a resultant increase in the susceptibility of glutamate-induced excitotoxicity rather than to a direct effect of the hormone to the Alzheimer disease-related genes.","0024-3205","Life sciences","(82) 1137-41",2008,"He","Jing","H","Department of Endocrinology, Metabolism, and Nephrology, Kochi Medical School, Kochi University, Kohasu, Oko-cho, Nankoku 783-8505, Japan."

The beta-secretase that executes the first cleavage event is a transmembrane aspartyl protease known as beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1). BACE1 pre-mRNA is alternatively spliced through the use of alternative splice sites in exons 3 and 4, although the significance of these splicing events is unclear. Here, we quantitatively measured relative levels of BACE1 transcripts and identified a novel splice variant of BACE1. We found a subtle but significant difference in BACE1 splicing between brain and pancreas, indicating the cellular environment can affect BACE1 alternative splicing. Furthermore, we have shown that BACE1 proteins translated from alternatively spliced transcripts have dramatically reduced beta-secretase activity and promotion of BACE1 alternative splicing reduces Abeta production. These findings illustrate the importance of BACE1 alternative splicing in affecting the level of Abeta produced in cells and suggest that targeting regulation of BACE1 alternative splicing is a potential therapeutic strategy for lowering beta-secretase activity.","0021-9258","The Journal of biological chemistry","(283) 18694-701",2008,"Karen R","Mowrer","KR","Center for Neurologic Diseases, Brigham Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts 02115, USA."

Amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides are hypothesized to cause the initiation and progression of AD based on pathologic data from AD patients, genetic analysis of mutations that cause early onset forms of AD, and preclinical studies. Based on this hypothesis, beta-site amyloid precursor protein (APP)-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) inhibitors are an attractive therapeutic approach for AD because cleavage of the APP by BACE1 is required to form Abeta. In this study, three potent BACE1 inhibitors are characterized. All three inhibitors decrease Abeta formation in cultured cells with IC(50) values less than 10 nM. Analysis of APP C-terminal fragments by immunoblotting and Abeta peptides by mass spectrometry showed that these inhibitors decreased Abeta by inhibiting BACE1. An assay for Abeta1-40 in mice was developed and used to show that these BACE1 inhibitors decreased plasma Abeta1-40, but not brain Abeta1-40, in wild-type mice. Because these BACE1 inhibitors were substrates for P-glycoprotein (P-gp), a member of the ATP-binding cassette superfamily of efflux transporters, these inhibitors were administered to P-gp knockout (KO) mice. These studies showed that all three BACE1 inhibitors decreased brain Abeta1-40 in P-gp KO mice, demonstrating that P-gp is a major limitation for development of BACE1 inhibitors to test the amyloid hypothesis. A comparison of plasma Abeta1-40 and brain Abeta1-40 dose responses for these three compounds revealed differences in relative ED(50) values, indicating that factors other than P-gp can also contribute to poor brain activity by BACE1 inhibitors.","1521-0103","The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics","(326) 502-13",2008,"Jere E","Meredith","JE","Research and Development, Bristol Myers Squibb, 5 Research Parkway, Wallingford, CT, USA. jere.meredith@bms.com"

Medium chain triglycerides (MCTs), which are rapidly converted to ketone bodies, were tested for their ability to provide an alternate energy source to neurons suffering from compromised glucose metabolism. The present study determined the short-term effects of ketosis in aged dogs, a natural model of amyloidosis. The animals were administered a 2 g/kg/day dose of MCTs for 2 months. Mitochondrial function and oxidative damage assays were then conducted on the frontal and parietal lobes.

Aged dogs receiving MCTs, as compared to age-matched controls, showed dramatically improved mitochondrial function, as evidenced by increased active respiration rates. This effect was most prominent in the parietal lobe. The improved mitochondrial function may have been due to a decrease in oxidative damage, which was limited to the mitochondrial fraction. Steady-state APP levels were also decreased in the parietal lobe after short-term MCT administration. Finally, there was a trend towards a decrease in total Abeta levels in the parietal lobe. BACE1 levels remained unchanged.

The key step in the generation of Abeta is cleavage of APP by beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1). There is increasing evidence supporting an interaction between APP, Abeta and metal ions. Both APP and Abeta affect ion homeostasis. Conversely, metal ions may interact with several AD-associated pathways involved in neurofibrillary tangle formation, secretase cleavage of APP, proteolytic degradation of Abeta and the generation of reactive oxygen species. However, the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here we first reported the differential effects of AD-related metal ions at subtoxic concentrations on the transcription levels of APP and BACE1 in PC12 cells. Copper (Cu(2+), 50-100 microM) and manganese (Mn(2+), 50-100 microM) potently increased the expression of both APP and BACE1 in a time- and concentration-dependent pattern, while zinc (Zn(2+)), iron (Fe(2+)) and aluminum (Al(3+)) did not. To uncover the mechanism(s) of the increasing expression by these ions, we observed the effects of several antioxidants and some specific inhibitors on the up-expression of APP and BACE1 by metal ions. Curcumin almost completely blocked the effects of these irons, while minocycline and sodium ferulate slightly suppressed the increased BACE1 mRNA level. Signaling pathway specific inhibitors PD98059, SB203580 and CEP11004 modestly blocked the up-transcription of APP induced by copper.

BACE1-AS concentrations were elevated in subjects with Alzheimer's disease and in amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice. These data show that BACE1 mRNA expression is under the control of a regulatory noncoding RNA that may drive Alzheimer's disease-associated pathophysiology.

Pathological mechanisms are already active early in the presymptomatic stage of AD. BACE1, beta-secretase, is one of the two key enzymes in amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing; the other being gamma-secretase. The Abeta peptide results from cleavage of APP initially by BACE1 to produce the C99 fragment and releases soluble APPbeta (sAPPbeta); C99 is then further cleaved by gamma-secretase leading to the Abeta peptide. Increased BACE1 activity and elevated levels of insoluble Abeta peptide have been shown in brain tissue of patients with sporadic AD. Since the CSF is in direct contact with the extracellular space of the central nervous system, biochemical changes in the brain can potentially be reflected in CSF. Therefore, CSF-based detection of BACE1 levels and activity might be valuable in aiding early detection and prediction, particularly in preclinical or even presymptomatic subjects who are at risk of AD. Recently, we were among the first groups to quantitatively analyse the enzymatic activities and protein levels of BACE1 in the CSF. Preliminary research using recently developed BACE1 ELISAs, BACE1 enzymatic activity, sAPPbeta and total Abeta1-x ELISAs were used by examining these hypothesis driven functional candidate markers in subjects with clinically diagnosed AD and amnestic MCI. Two sandwich ELISAs were used and BACE1 enzymatic activities were seen by synthetic fluorescence substrate and total Abeta levels by sandwich-ELISA. Moreover, elevated CSF levels of BACE1 protein were associated with an increased risk ratio in MCI. Interestingly, amnestic MCI subjects showed increased levels of BACE1 activity compared to HC and AD patients. For total Abeta and tau, increased CSF levels were associated with a higher risk of MCI compared to HC as well. BACE1 activity was significantly correlated with BACE1 protein concentration and total Abeta levels, with Abeta being itself correlated with the BACE1 protein level. Currently, independent studies are ongoing to validate BACE1 and functionally associated proteins as candidate biomarkers for early detection, prediction, progression as well as for biological activity in AD.","1502-7686","Scandinavian journal of clinical and laboratory investigation","(69) 8-12",2009,"Harald","Hampel","H","1Discipline of Psychiatry, School of Medicine and Trinity College Institute of Neuroscience, Trinity College Dublin, Ireland. harald.hampel@tcd.ie"

18650447,"Proteolytic shedding of ST6Gal-I by BACE1 regulates the glycosylation and function of alpha4beta1 integrins.","Differentiation of monocytes into macrophages is accompanied by increased cell adhesiveness, due in part to the activation of alpha4beta1 integrins. Here we report that the sustained alpha4beta1 activation associated with macrophage differentiation results from expression of beta1 integrin subunits that lack alpha2-6-linked sialic acids, a carbohydrate modification added by the ST6Gal-I sialyltransferase. During differentiation of U937 monocytic cells and primary human CD14(+) monocytes, ST6Gal-I is down-regulated, leading to beta1 hyposialylation and enhanced alpha4beta1-dependent VCAM-1 binding. Importantly, ST6Gal-I down-regulation results from cleavage by the BACE1 secretase, which we show is dramatically up-regulated during macrophage differentiation. BACE1 up-regulation, ST6Gal-I shedding, beta1 hyposialylation, and alpha4beta1-dependent VCAM-1 binding are all temporally correlated and share the same signaling mechanism (protein kinase C/Ras/ERK). Preventing ST6Gal-I down-regulation (and therefore integrin hyposialylation), through BACE1 inhibition or ST6Gal-I constitutive overexpression, eliminates VCAM-1 binding. Similarly, preventing integrin hyposialylation inhibits a differentiation-induced increase in the expression of an activation-dependent conformational epitope on the beta1 subunit. Collectively, these results describe a novel mechanism for alpha4beta1 regulation and further suggest an unanticipated role for BACE1 in macrophage function.","0021-9258","The Journal of biological chemistry","(283) 26364-73",2008,"Alencia V","Woodard-Grice","AV","Department of Physiology and Biophysics, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Alabama 35294, USA."

Specifically, BACE1 is transiently acetylated on seven lysine residues in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum/endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ER/ERGIC). The acetylated intermediates of the nascent protein are able to reach the Golgi apparatus, whereas the non-acetylated ones are retained and degraded in a post-ER compartment. Here, we report that the serine protease PCSK9 (proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin type 9) contributes to the disposal of non-acetylated BACE1. Both overexpression and small interfering RNA-mediated downregulation of PCSK9 affected the levels of BACE1. The downregulation of PCSK9 affected the levels of the loss-of-acetylation mutants (BACE1(Ala) and BACE1(Arg)) but not those of the gain-of-acetylation mutant (BACE1(Gln)). In addition, Pcsk9(-/-) mice showed increased levels of BACE1 and Abeta in the brain. Finally, we found that nascent low-density lipoprotein receptor, a known substrate of PCSK9, is also acetylated.","1469-3178","EMBO reports","(9) 916-22",2008,"Mary Cabell","Jonas","MC","Department of Medicine, University of Wisconsin-Madison, VAH-GRECC 11G, 2500 Overlook Terrace, Madison, Wisconsin 53705, USA."

However, it is not clear whether and how increased lipid peroxidation might lead to amyloidogenesis, a hallmark of AD. Glutathione peroxidase 4 (Gpx4) is an essential antioxidant defense enzyme that protects an organism against lipid peroxidation. Gpx4+/- mice show increased lipid peroxidation in brain, as evidenced by their elevated levels of 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal. To understand the role of lipid peroxidation in amyloidogenesis, we studied secretase activities in Gpx4+/- mice as a function of age. Both young (6 months) and middle-aged (17-20 months) Gpx4+/- mice had higher levels of beta-secretase activity than their age-matched wildtype controls, and the increased beta-secretase activity in Gpx4+/- mice was a result of up-regulation of beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleavage enzyme 1 (BACE1) expression at the protein level. The high level of BACE1 protein led to increased endogenous beta-amyloid (Abeta)(1-40) in middle-aged Gpx4+/- mice. We further studied amyloidogenesis in APPGpx4+/- mice. Our data indicate that APPGpx4+/- mice had significantly increased amyloid plaque burdens and increased Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) levels compared with APPGpx4+/+ mice. Therefore, our results indicate that increased lipid peroxidation leads to increased amyloidogenesis through up-regulation of BACE1 expression in vivo, a mechanism that may be important in pathogenesis of AD at early stages.","1471-4159","Journal of neurochemistry","(107) 197-207",2008,"Liuji","Chen","L","Department of Cellular and Structural Biology, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, Texas, USA."

We found a significantly increased percentage of TNF-alpha, COX-2, PARP-1, CD38, C99 or presenilin-1 positive PBMCs in AD patients compared with healthy subjects. FACS analyses revealed that the percentage of C99 or presenilin-1 positive PBMCs, which also express TNF-alpha, COX-2, PARP-1 or CD38 is also increased in AD patients. Additionally, AD patients had significantly increased plasma oxLDL and TNF-alpha levels. Furthermore, we found positive correlations between plasma oxLDL or TNF-alpha concentrations and the percentage of TNFalpha+, COX-2+ or PARP-1+, as well as PS-1+, C99+ or BACE+ PBMCs.

Therefore, BACE1 is one of the key therapeutic targets that can prevent the progression of AD. Previous studies showed that knocking out the BACE1 gene prevents Abeta formation, but results in behavioral deficits and specific synaptic dysfunctions at Schaffer collateral to CA1 synapses. However, BACE1 protein is most highly expressed at the mossy fiber projections in CA3. Here, we report that BACE1 knock-out mice display reduced presynaptic function, as measured by an increase in paired-pulse facilitation ratio. More dramatically, mossy fiber long-term potentiation (LTP), which is normally expressed via an increase in presynaptic release, was eliminated in the knock-outs. Although long-term depression was slightly larger in the BACE1 knock-outs, it could not be reversed. The specific deficit in mossy fiber LTP was upstream of cAMP signaling and could be ""rescued"" by transiently elevating extracellular Ca2+ concentration. These results suggest that BACE1 may play a critical role in regulating presynaptic function, especially activity-dependent strengthening of presynaptic release, at mossy fiber synapses.","1529-2401","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","(28) 8677-81",2008,"Hui","Wang","H","Department of Biology, College of Chemical and Life Sciences, University of Maryland, College Park, Maryland 20742, USA."

18798280,"Inhibition by KMI-574 leads to dislocalization of BACE1 from lipid rafts.","BACE1 initiates processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the production of amyloid beta (Abeta) peptide. After beta-cleavage by BACE1, the C-terminal stub of the APP fragment is further processed by the gamma-secretase complex to produce Abeta. Because APP, Abeta, the gamma-secretase complex, and BACE1 are found in lipid raft membranes, Abeta production is widely accepted to occur in lipid rafts. However, whether BACE1 is activated within the rafts is unclear. To analyze the relationship between the activity and the localization of BACE1, we used a new BACE1 inhibitor, KMI-574, and separated raft membranes on sucrose density gradients. In the presence of KMI-574, the localization of BACE1 shifted from the rafts to nonraft membranes in HEK293 cells. We also analyzed the proteolytically inactive mutants, D93A, D289A, and D93A/D289A, of BACE1. These mutants also moved from rafts to nonrafts, and the D93A/D289A double-mutant localized exclusively to nonraft membranes. The mutants were defective in maturation by glynosylation and formed hyperoligomers, suggesting that the BACE1 oligomers could not exit from the ER and be transported to the Golgi apparatus. Our findings suggest that the activated conformation of BACE1 is important for protein transport and localization to lipid rafts.","1097-4547","Journal of neuroscience research","(87) 360-8",2009,"Maiko","Ebina","M","Department of Life Sciences, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, University of Tokyo, Meguro-ku, Tokyo, Japan."

We found that the positive labeled cells of activated caspase-3, Abeta, and BACE1 were significantly and time-dependently increased in the ipsilateral striatum. The results of Western blotting and RT-PCR showed that caspase-3 inhibitor Z-DEVD-FMK reduced BACE1 mRNA and protein levels, and inhibited its protease activity, thereby decreasing the amount of APP C99 and Abeta in ischemic brains. Moreover, Z-DEVD-FMK reduced BACE1 and GFAP double-labeled cells, but not GFAP protein levels or GFAP-labeled cells, in the ipsilateral striatum. Thus, we demonstrated that caspase-3 inhibition attenuated ischemia-induced Abeta formation by reducing BACE1 production and activity.

Hypercholesterolemia is a risk factor for AD and has been shown by laboratory studies to cause Abeta accumulation. Abeta levels in the brain are governed by its generation from amyloid precursor protein by beta-secretase (BACE1), degradation by the insulin degrading enzyme (IDE), clearance from the brain by the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP-1), and transport from circulation into the brain by receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE). However, the mechanisms by which hypercholesterolemia causes Abeta accumulation in the brain and contributes to the pathogenesis of AD are still to be determined. In the present study, we determined the extent to which hypercholesterolemia-induced Abeta accumulation is associated with alterations in BACE1, IDE, LRP-1, and RAGE expression levels. We show that hypercholesterolemia increases Abeta production, an effect that is associated with increased levels of BACE1 and RAGE and reduced levels of IDE and LRP-1. These results suggest that reducing Abeta accumulation in the brain may require strategies that combine reduction of generation and transport of Abeta in addition to acceleration of degradation and clearance of this peptide.","0047-6374","Mechanisms of ageing and development","(129) 649-55",2008,"R P","Jaya Prasanthi","RP","Department of Pharmacology, Physiology and Therapeutics, University of North Dakota School of Medicine and Health Sciences, 501 North Columbia Road, Grand Forks, ND 58202, United States."

Although previous mouse studies have shown brain A beta lowering after BACE1 inhibition, extension of such studies to nonhuman primates or man was precluded by poor potency, brain penetration, and pharmacokinetics of available inhibitors. In this study, a novel tertiary carbinamine BACE1 inhibitor, tertiary carbinamine (TC)-1, was assessed in a unique cisterna magna ported rhesus monkey model, where the temporal dynamics of A beta in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma could be evaluated. TC-1, a potent inhibitor (IC(50) approximately 0.4 nM), has excellent passive membrane permeability, low susceptibility to P-glycoprotein transport, and lowered brain A beta levels in a mouse model. Intravenous infusion of TC-1 led to a significant but transient lowering of CSF and plasma A beta levels in conscious rhesus monkeys because it underwent CYP3A4-mediated metabolism. Oral codosing of TC-1 with ritonavir, a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, twice daily over 3.5 days in rhesus monkeys led to sustained plasma TC-1 exposure and a significant and sustained reduction in CSF sAPP beta, A beta 40, A beta 42, and plasma A beta 40 levels. CSF A beta 42 lowering showed an EC(50) of approximately 20 nM with respect to the CSF [TC-1] levels, demonstrating excellent concordance with its potency in a cell-based assay.

Cholesterol dependency of beta cleavage prompted us to analyze immunoisolated APP-containing detergent-resistant membranes from rodent brains. We found syntaxin 1 as a key molecule for activity-dependent regulation of APP processing in cholesterol-dependent microdomains. In living cells, APP associates with syntaxin 1-containing microdomains through X11-Munc18, which inhibits the APP-BACE1 interaction and beta cleavage via microdomain segregation. Phosphorylation of Munc18 by cdk5 causes a shift of APP to BACE1-containing microdomains. Neuronal hyperactivity, implicated in Abeta overproduction, promotes the switching of APP microdomain association as well as beta cleavage in a partially cdk5-dependent manner. We propose that microdomain switching is a mechanism of cholesterol- and activity-dependent regulation of APP processing in neurons.","1540-8140","The Journal of cell biology","(183) 339-52",2008,"Takashi","Sakurai","T","Laboratory for Structural Neuropathology, RIKEN Brain Science Institute, Wako, Saitama 351-0198, Japan."

The VGSC alpha subunit gene family consists of 10 members, which have distinct tissue-specific and developmental expression profiles. So far, four beta subunits (beta1-beta4) and one splice variant of beta1 (beta1A, also called beta1B) have been identified. VGSC beta subunits are multifunctional, serving as modulators of channel activity, regulators of channel cell surface expression, and as members of the immunoglobulin superfamily, cell adhesion molecules (CAMs). beta subunits are substrates of beta-amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme (BACE1) and gamma-secretase, yielding intracellular domains (ICDs) that may further modulate cellular activity via transcription. Recent evidence shows that beta1 regulates migration and pathfinding in the developing postnatal CNS in vivo. The alpha and beta subunits, together with other components of the VGSC signaling complex, may have dynamic interactive roles depending on cell/tissue type, developmental stage, and pathophysiology. In addition to excitable cells like nerve and muscle, VGSC alpha and beta subunits are functionally expressed in cells that are traditionally considered nonexcitable, including glia, vascular endothelial cells, and cancer cells. In particular, the alpha subunits are up-regulated in line with metastatic potential and are proposed to enhance cellular migration and invasion. In contrast to the alpha subunits, beta1 is more highly expressed in weakly metastatic cancer cells, and evidence suggests that its expression enhances cellular adhesion. Thus, novel roles are emerging for VGSC alpha and beta subunits in regulating migration during normal postnatal development of the CNS as well as during cancer metastasis.","1073-8584","The Neuroscientist : a review journal bringing neurobiology, neurology and psychiatry","(14) 571-83",2008,"William J","Brackenbury","WJ","Department of Pharmacology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, MI 48109-0632, USA."

Both proteins display acetyl-CoA:lysine acetyltransferase activity, can interact with and acetylate BACE1, and display an ER/ERGIC localization with the catalytic site facing the lumen of the organelle. Both ATase1 and ATase2 regulate the steady-state levels of BACE1 and the rate of amyloid beta-peptide generation. Finally, their transcripts are up-regulated by ceramide treatment.

Here, we elaborate on the recent finding that auxiliary subunits of voltage-gated sodium channels (beta2 and beta4) are BACE substrates. BACE1 produced complex effects on sodium channel gating that could be only partially explained by beta2/beta4 cleavage. To characterize the unexpected non-proteolytic effect of BACE1, we examined HEK cells co-transfected with only Nav1.2 and either normal or catalytically inactive BACE1. Both BACE1 variants produced virtually identical effects on sodium channel gating, which would lead to enhanced cellular excitability. The non-proteolytic BACE1 effect on Nav1.2 current was confirmed in murine neuroblastoma cells, which express sodium channels endogenously, but lack beta2 and beta4. Our study reveals an important facet of BACE1 function that should help to decipher the role of BACE1 in normal and demented brain.","1095-953X","Neurobiology of disease","(33) 282-9",2009,"Tobias","Huth","T","Institutes of Physiology, University of Kiel Olshausenstr. 40, 24098 Kiel, Germany."

In the present study, this concept was extended to investigations in primary hippocampal neurons to test whether Abeta release was coregulated by cathepsins and electrical activity, proposed components of a regulated secretory pathway. Inhibition of cathepsin B (catB) activity with CA074Me or attenuation of catB expression through small interfering RNA produced decreases in Abeta release, similar to levels produced with suppression of beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) expression. To test whether the catB-dependent release of Abeta was linked to ongoing electrical activity, neurons were treated with tetrodotoxin (TTX) and CA074Me. These comparisons demonstrated no additivity between decreases in Abeta release produced by TTX and CA074Me. In contrast, pharmacological inhibition of cathepsin L (catL) selectively elevated Abeta42 levels but not Abeta40 or total Abeta. Mechanistic studies measuring C-terminal fragments of amyloid precursor protein (APP) suggested that catL elevated alpha-secretase activity, thereby suppressing Abeta42 levels. The mechanism of catB-mediated regulation of Abeta release remains unclear but may involve elevation of beta-secretase. In summary, these studies provide evidence for a significant alternative pathway for APP processing that involves catB and activity-dependent release of Abeta in a regulated secretory pathway for primary neurons.","1521-0103","The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics","(328) 813-21",2009,"Donna M","Klein","DM","Drug Discovery, Johnson and Johnson Pharmaceutical Research and Development, L.L.C., Welsh and McKean Roads, Spring House, Pennsylvania, USA.

19074428,"Alzheimer disease Abeta production in the absence of S-palmitoylation-dependent targeting of BACE1 to lipid rafts.","Alzheimer disease beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides are generated via sequential proteolysis of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by BACE1 and gamma-secretase. A subset of BACE1 localizes to cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains, termed lipid rafts. BACE1 processing in raft microdomains of cultured cells and neurons was characterized in previous studies by disrupting the integrity of lipid rafts by cholesterol depletion. These studies found either inhibition or elevation of Abeta production depending on the extent of cholesterol depletion, generating controversy. The intricate interplay between cholesterol levels, APP trafficking, and BACE1 processing is not clearly understood because cholesterol depletion has pleiotropic effects on Golgi morphology, vesicular trafficking, and membrane bulk fluidity. In this study, we used an alternate strategy to explore the function of BACE1 in membrane microdomains without altering the cellular cholesterol level. We demonstrate that BACE1 undergoes S-palmitoylation at four Cys residues at the junction of transmembrane and cytosolic domains, and Ala substitution at these four residues is sufficient to displace BACE1 from lipid rafts. Analysis of wild type and mutant BACE1 expressed in BACE1 null fibroblasts and neuroblastoma cells revealed that S-palmitoylation neither contributes to protein stability nor subcellular localization of BACE1. Surprisingly, non-raft localization of palmitoylation-deficient BACE1 did not have discernible influence on BACE1 processing of APP or secretion of Abeta. These results indicate that post-translational S-palmitoylation of BACE1 is not required for APP processing, and that BACE1 can efficiently cleave APP in both raft and non-raft microdomains.","0021-9258","The Journal of biological chemistry","(284) 3793-803",2009,"Kulandaivelu S","Vetrivel","KS","Department of Neurobiology, Neurology, and Pathology, The University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60637, USA."

Here it is shown that mice treated with Al plus D-gal represent a good model of AD with altered expression of Abeta metabolism-associated molecules. The work shows that Al/D-gal causes memory impairment and high Abeta levels in the cortex (Co) and hippocampus (Hi). Then, we found that beta-site APP cleavage enzyme 1 (BACE1) was increased in mouse Co and Hi. Al or Al plus D-gal suppressed mRNA of the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1(LRP1). D-gal also decreased the LRP expression in Hi, but not in Co. However, Al/D-gal did not affect the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) expression in mouse brains. Furthermore, Al/D-gal reduced the expression of neprilysin (NEP), but not the insulin degrading enzyme (IDE).

In the present study, we used recently developed sandwich ELISA systems that specifically detect the soluble cleaved form of ST6Gal I in plasma. We found that the level of plasma ST6Gal I was increased in two different types of liver injury models. In zone 1 hepatocyte-injured rats, the level of plasma ST6Gal I was increased together with acute phase reactions. Meanwhile, in zone 3 hepatocyte-injured rats, ST6Gal I secretion was most likely triggered by oxidative stress. Taken together, we propose two possible mechanisms for the upregulation of plasma ST6Gal I in hepatopathological situations: one accompanied by acute phase reactions to increase hepatic ST6Gal I expression and the other triggered by oxidative stress in the liver. We also found that the serum level of ST6Gal I in hepatitis C patients was correlated with the activity of hepatic inflammation.","1460-2423","Glycobiology","(19) 479-87",2009,"Shinobu","Kitazume","S","Glyco-chain Functions Laboratory, RIKEN, 2-1 Hirosawa, Wako-shi, Saitama 351-0198, Japan. shinobuk@riken.jp"

Copper exposure resulted in altered amyloid precursor protein processing; increased accumulation of the amyloid precursor protein and its proteolytic product, C99 fragment, along with increased generation of amyloid-beta peptides and oligomers. These changes were found to be mediated via up-regulation of BACE1 as significant increases in BACE1 levels and deposits were detected around plaques in mice following copper exposure. Furthermore, tau pathology within hippocampal neurons was exacerbated in copper-exposed 3xTg-AD group. Increased tau phosphorylation was closely correlated with aberrant cdk5/p25 activation, suggesting a role for this kinase in the development of copper-induced tau pathology.

19196431,"The up-regulation of BACE1 mediated by hypoxia and ischemic injury: role of oxidative stress and HIF1alpha.","While it is well established that stroke and cerebral hypoperfusion are both significant risk factors for Alzheimer's disease, the molecular link between ischemia and amyloid precursor protein processing has only been recently established. Specifically, hypoxia significantly increases beta-site APP cleaving enzyme (BACE1) gene transcription through the over-expression of hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha, resulting in increased BACE1 secretase activity and amyloid-beta production. In this study, we significantly extend these findings both in vitro, in differentiated SK-N-BE neuroblastoma cells, and in vivo, in rats subjected to cerebral ischemia, showing that hypoxia up-regulates BACE1 expression through a biphasic mechanism. The early post-hypoxic up-regulation of BACE1 depends on the production of reactive oxygen species mediated by the sudden interruption of the mitochondrial electron transport chain, while the later expression of BACE1 is caused by hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha activation. The involvement of reactive oxygen species released by mitochondria in the BACE1 up-regulation was confirmed by the complete protection exerted by complex I inhibitors such as rotenone and diphenyl-phenylen iodonium. Moreover, the oxidative stress-mediated up-regulation of BACE1 is mediated by c-jun N terminal kinase pathway as demonstrated by the protection exerted by the silencing of c-jun N-terminal kinase isoforms 1 and 2.

Here we show that PS1 mutations, expressed both transiently and stably, in non-neuronal and neuronal cell lines increase the expression and the activity of the beta-secretase (BACE1), the rate-limiting step of Abeta production. Also, BACE1 expression and activity are elevated in brains of PS1 mutant knock-in mice compared with wild type littermates as well as in cerebral cortex of FAD cases bearing various PS1 mutations compared with in sporadic AD cases and controls. The up-regulation of BACE1 by PS1 mutations requires the gamma-secretase cleavage of APP and is proportional to the amount of secreted Abeta42. Abeta42, and not AICD (APP intracellular domain), is indeed the APP derivative that mediates the overexpression of BACE1.

Epidemiological studies on the hypercholesterolemia-AD risk relation and some reports indicating a beneficial effect of statin therapy suggest cholesterol as a susceptibility factor in AD. The ApoE4 genotype as a prevalent genetic risk factor for AD and the function of ApoE as main cholesterol carrier in the brain also underlie a close cholesterol load-AD risk relation. Finally, cell biology evidences support a critical involvement of lipid raft cholesterol in the modulation of beta- and gamma-secretase cleavage of APP with altered Abeta production. However, little exchange does exist between circulating and brain cholesterol, the latter arising from endogenous synthesis. In addition, increasing evidence supports the idea that amyloid cytotoxicity in most cases is initiated by oligomer recruitment at the cell membrane with loss of membrane integrity, Ca(2+) ingress into the cell, oxidative stress and apoptosis. In such a scenario, increased membrane cholesterol seems to be protective by disfavouring aggregate binding to the membrane. Recent findings also indicate that a reduction of cellular cholesterol favours co-localization of BACE1 and APP in non-raft membrane domains and hinders generation of plasmin, an Abeta-degrading enzyme. Finally, recent researches on Seladin-1, involved in cholesterol biosynthesis, show that modulation of membrane cholesterol affects Abeta generation and cell resistance against Abeta oligomer toxicity. These data confirm previous findings indicating a reduction of the cholesterol/phospholipid ratio in aged and AD brains. The aim of this review is to critically discuss some of the main results reported in the recent years in this field supporting a role of cholesterol either as a susceptibility factor or as a protective agent in AD.","1875-5828","Current Alzheimer research","(6) 15-29",2009,"Massimo","Stefani","M","Department of Biochemical Sciences and Research Centre on Neurodegeneration (CIMN), University of Florence, Florence, Italy. stefani@scibio.unifi.it"

On the other hand, exogenous Aβ(1-40) enhanced TD-induced production of ROS. A study on mice indicated that TD also caused Aβ accumulation in the brain, which was reversed by thiamine supplementation.

Insulin modulates metabolism of beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) in neurons, decreasing the intracellular accumulation of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides, which are pivotal in AD pathogenesis. The present study investigates whether the widely prescribed insulin-sensitizing drug, metformin (Glucophage(R)), affects APP metabolism and Abeta generation in various cell models. We demonstrate that metformin, at doses that lead to activation of the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), significantly increases the generation of both intracellular and extracellular Abeta species. Furthermore, the effect of metformin on Abeta generation is mediated by transcriptional up-regulation of beta-secretase (BACE1), which results in an elevated protein level and increased enzymatic activity. Unlike insulin, metformin exerts no effect on Abeta degradation. In addition, we found that glucose deprivation and various tyrphostins, known inhibitors of insulin-like growth factors/insulin receptor tyrosine kinases, do not modulate the effect of metformin on Abeta. Finally, inhibition of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) by the pharmacological inhibitor Compound C largely suppresses metformin's effect on Abeta generation and BACE1 transcription, suggesting an AMPK-dependent mechanism. Although insulin and metformin display opposing effects on Abeta generation, in combined use, metformin enhances insulin's effect in reducing Abeta levels. Our findings suggest a potentially harmful consequence of this widely prescribed antidiabetic drug when used as a monotherapy in elderly diabetic patients.","1091-6490","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","(106) 3907-12",2009,"Yaomin","Chen","Y","Neurodegenerative Disease Research Program, Burnham Institute for Medical Research, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA."

We previously demonstrated that the C-terminal 37 amino acids of lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) robustly promoted Abeta generation independent of FE65 and specifically interacted with Ran-binding protein 9 (RanBP9). In this study we found that RanBP9 strongly increased BACE1 cleavage of APP and Abeta generation. This pro-amyloidogenic activity of RanBP9 did not depend on the KPI domain or the Swedish APP mutation. In cells expressing wild type APP, RanBP9 reduced cell surface APP and accelerated APP internalization, consistent with enhanced beta-secretase processing in the endocytic pathway. The N-terminal half of RanBP9 containing SPRY-LisH domains not only interacted with LRP but also with APP and BACE1. Overexpression of RanBP9 resulted in the enhancement of APP interactions with LRP and BACE1 and increased lipid raft association of APP. Importantly, knockdown of endogenous RanBP9 significantly reduced Abeta generation in Chinese hamster ovary cells and in primary neurons, demonstrating its physiological role in BACE1 cleavage of APP. These findings not only implicate RanBP9 as a novel and potent regulator of APP processing but also as a potential therapeutic target for Alzheimer disease.","0021-9258","The Journal of biological chemistry","(284) 11863-72",2009,"Madepalli K","Lakshmana","MK","Department of Neurosciences, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093, USA."
19276086,"Intracellular trafficking of presenilin 1 is regulated by beta-amyloid precursor protein and phospholipase D1.","Excessive accumulation of beta-amyloid peptides in the brain is a major cause for the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. beta-Amyloid is derived from beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) through sequential cleavages by beta- and gamma-secretases, whose enzymatic activities are tightly controlled by subcellular localization. Delineation of how intracellular trafficking of these secretases and APP is regulated is important for understanding Alzheimer disease pathogenesis. Although APP trafficking is regulated by multiple factors including presenilin 1 (PS1), a major component of the gamma-secretase complex, and phospholipase D1 (PLD1), a phospholipid-modifying enzyme, regulation of intracellular trafficking of PS1/gamma-secretase and beta-secretase is less clear. Here we demonstrate that APP can reciprocally regulate PS1 trafficking; APP deficiency results in faster transport of PS1 from the trans-Golgi network to the cell surface and increased steady state levels of PS1 at the cell surface, which can be reversed by restoring APP levels. Restoration of APP in APP-deficient cells also reduces steady state levels of other gamma-secretase components (nicastrin, APH-1, and PEN-2) and the cleavage of Notch by PS1/gamma-secretase that is more highly correlated with cell surface levels of PS1 than with APP overexpression levels, supporting the notion that Notch is mainly cleaved at the cell surface. In contrast, intracellular trafficking of beta-secretase (BACE1) is not regulated by APP. Moreover, we find that PLD1 also regulates PS1 trafficking and that PLD1 overexpression promotes cell surface accumulation of PS1 in an APP-independent manner. Our results clearly elucidate a physiological function of APP in regulating protein trafficking and suggest that intracellular trafficking of PS1/gamma-secretase is regulated by multiple factors, including APP and PLD1.","0021-9258","The Journal of biological chemistry","(284) 12145-52",2009,"Yun","Liu","Y","Burnham Institute for Medical Research, La Jolla, California 92037, USA."

Because RAGE stimulates intracellular calcium, nuclear factor of activated T-cells 1 (NFAT1) was examined. NFAT1 was activated following RAGE-induced BACE1 expression followed by Abeta generation. Injection of soluble RAGE (sRAGE), which acts as a competitor with full-length RAGE (fRAGE), into aged Tg2576 mouse brains reduced the levels of plaques, Abeta, BACE1, and the active form of NFAT1 compared with fRAGE-injected Tg2576 mice.

The results showed that HFD-STZ treatment induced obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, hyperinsulinemia, hyperglycemia and insulin resistance, characteristics of type 2 diabetes. The performance of rats in the Morris water maze test was impaired in MCAO-NPD and Sham-HFD-STZ rats, indicating cognitive deficits. Hippocampal caspase-3+ and beta amyloid (Abeta+) cell numbers, as well as beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme (BACE1) levels and activity, increased in both groups. Moreover, HFD-STZ treatment exacerbated stroke-induced cognitive deficits, additively increased MCAO-induced activation of caspase-3, and increased levels of BACE1, C99 and Abeta. However, the level of insulin decreased in MCAO-HFD-STZ rats. These results suggested that type 2 diabetes deteriorated stroke-induced brain damage and cognitive impairment, which might be associated with increased Abeta generation and cytotoxicity.

In the present study, we investigated whether the absence of CC chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) results in activation of astrocytes, Abeta deposit and memory dysfunction in CCR5 knock (CCR5(-/-)) out mice. We found that long-term and spatial memory functions were impaired in CCR5(-/-) mice. There was a significant increased expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in the brain of CCR5(-/-) mice as compared with that of wild type of CCR5 (CCR5(+/+)) mice. The expression of CCR5 was observed in CCR5(+/+) astrocytes, but was reduced in the CCR5(-/-) astrocytes even though the expression of GFAP was much higher. Paralleling with the activation of astorcytes, the Abeta(1-42) level was higher in the brains of CCR5(-/-) mice than that of CCR5(+/+) mice. Expression of beta-secretase (BACE1) and its product C99 was significantly elevated in CCR5(-/-) mice. The activation of CC chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) causes activation of astrocytes that leads to Abeta deposit and memory dysfunction in CCR5(-/-) mice. In CCR5(-/-) mice, CCR2 expression was high and co-localized with GFAP. These findings suggest that the absence of CCR5 increases expression of CCR2, which leads to the activation of astrocytes causing Abeta deposit, and thereby impairs memory function.

Recently, we and others identified reticulon 3 (RTN3) and reticulon 4-B/C (RTN4-B/C or Nogo-B/C) as membrane proteins that interact with BACE1 and inhibit its ability to produce Abeta. In this study, we employed various mutants of RTN3 and RTN4-C and C. elegans RTN to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which RTNs regulate BACE1. We found that RTN3 mutants lacking the N-terminal or C-terminal or loop domain as well as a RTN4-C mutant lacking the C-terminal domain bound to BACE1 comparably to wild-type RTN3 and RTN4-C. Furthermore, overexpression of wild-type RTN3, RTN4-C, and these RTN mutants similarly reduced Abeta40 and Abeta42 secretion by cells expressing Swedish mutant APP. C. elegans RTN, which has low homology to human RTNs, also interacted with BACE1 and inhibited Abeta secretion. In contrast, two RTN3 mutants containing deletions of the first or second potential transmembrane domains and an RTN3 swap mutant of the second transmembrane domain bound BACE1 but failed to inhibit Abeta secretion. Collectively, these results suggest that the two-transmembrane-domain tertiary structure of RTN proteins is critical for the ability of RTNs to modulate BACE1 activity, whereas N-terminal, C-terminal and loop regions are not essential for this function.","1097-4547","Journal of neuroscience research","(87) 2963-72",2009,"Hideaki","Kume","H","Department of Demyelinating Disease and Aging, National Institute of Neuroscience, NCNP, Tokyo, Japan."

Indeed, Abeta plays an early and central role in this disease. beta-site amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is the initiating enzyme in Abeta genesis and BACE1 levels are elevated under a variety of conditions.

However, nine years on from the initial identification of BACE1, and despite intense research, a number of key questions regarding BACE1 remain unanswered. Indeed, drug discovery and development for AD continues to be challenging. While current AD therapies temporarily slow cognitive decline, treatments that address the underlying pathologic mechanisms of AD are completely lacking. Here we review the basic biology of BACE1. We pay special attention to recent research that has provided some answers to questions such as those involving the identification of novel BACE1 substrates, the potential causes of BACE1 elevation and the putative function of BACE1 in health and disease.

Here, we show that p75-deficient sympathetic neurons are more sensitive to Abeta-induced neurite growth inhibition. To investigate the role of p75 in the sympathetic nervous system of AD, p75 mutant mice were crossed with a mouse line of AD model. The majority of p75-deficient AD mice died by 3 weeks of age. The lethality is associated with severe defects in sympathetic innervation to multiple organs. When 1 copy of the BACE1 gene encoding a protein essential in Abeta production was deleted in p75-deficient AD mice, sympathetic innervation was significantly restored.

BACE1 is the principle beta-secretase, since its knock-out completely prevents Abeta generation. BACE1 is likely to process a number of different substrates and consequently several independent physiological functions may be exerted by BACE1. Currently the function of BACE1 in myelination is best understood. BACE1 cleaves and activates Neuregulin-1 and is thus directly involved in myelination of the peripheral nervous system during early postnatal development. However, additional physiological functions specifically within the central nervous system are so far less understood. BACE1 is upregulated in at least some AD brains. Multiple cellular mechanisms for BACE1 regulation are known including post-transcriptional regulation via its 5'-untranslated region, microRNA and non-coding anti-sense RNA. BACE1 is a primary target for Abeta lowering therapies, however the development of high affinity bio-available inhibitors has been a major challenge so far.","1084-9521","Seminars in cell & developmental biology","(20) 175-82",2009,"Michael","Willem","M","Center for Integrated Protein Science Munich, Adolf-Butenandt-Institute, Department of Biochemistry, Laboratory for Neurodegenerative Disease Research, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, 80336 Munich, Germany. mwillem@med.uni-muenchen.de"

Two polymorphisms (-918G/A, rs4938369; -2014T/C, rs3017608) were identified in the BACE1 promoter.

A more marked increase in -918G/-2014T transcriptional activity was seen when under hypoxia treatment. EMSA indicated that the -918G allele bound nuclear factors more strongly than -918A allele did.

The three approaches of the current study evaluated the effects of chronic nicotine treatment in the prevention of Aβ-induced impairment of learning and short-term memory. Rat AD model was induced by 14-day i.c.v. osmotic pump infusion of a 1:1 mixture of 300 pmol/day Aβ(1-40)/Aβ(1-42) or Aβ(40-1) (inactive peptide, control). The effect of nicotine (2 mg/(kg day)) on Aβ-induced spatial learning and memory impairments was assessed by evaluation of performance in the radial arm water maze (RAWM), in vivo electrophysiological recordings of early-phase long-term potentiation (E-LTP) in urethane-anesthetized rats, and immunoblot analysis to determine changes in the levels of beta-site amyloid precursor protein (APP)-cleaving enzyme (BACE), Aβ and memory-related proteins. The results indicate that 6 weeks of nicotine treatment reduced the levels of Aβ(1-40) and BACE1 peptides in hippocampal area CA1 and prevented Aβ-induced impairment of learning and short-term memory. Chronic nicotine also prevented the Aβ-induced inhibition of basal synaptic transmission and LTP in hippocampal area CA1. Furthermore, chronic nicotine treatment prevented the Aβ-induced reduction of α(7)- and α(4)-nAChR.

Protein expression of β-amyloid (Aβ), β-secretase (BACE1), neprilysin (NEP), insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) and receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) in the brain was measured. The results indicated that Al + D-gal induced an AD-like behavioral deficit at 90 days. The period from 45 to 75 days showed no significant behavioral deficit, and we tentatively define this as predementia in this model. A significant increase in BACE1 and decreasing NEP characterized days 45–90 in the cortex and hippocampus. However, high Aβ occurred at day 60. IDE increased from day 60 to day 75. There was no change in RAGE. The results suggest that the observed changes in BACE1, NEP and Aβ in predementia might relate to a different stage of the AD-like pathology, which may be developed into useful biomarkers for the diagnosis of very early AD.","1574-4647","Age (Dordrecht, Netherlands)","(31) 277-84",2009,"Zong-Zheng","Sun","ZZ","Department of Neurology, Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital, Nanjing University Medical School, 321 Zhong Shan Road, Nanjing, Jiangsu, People’s Republic of China."
19476501,"Regulation of secretases by all-trans-retinoic acid.","One of the emerging approaches for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease aims at reducing toxic levels of Alphabeta-species through the modulation of secretases, namely by inducing alpha-secretase or inhibiting beta-secretase and/or gamma-secretase activities, or a combination of both. Although there is increasing evidence for the involvement of retinoids in Alzheimer's disease, their significance in the regulation of Alphabeta-peptide production remains unresolved. Our work concentrated on the regulation of all secretases mediated by all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), and supports the hypothesis that ATRA is capable of regulating them in an antiamyloidogenic sense at the levels of transcription, translation, and activation. Apart from increased alpha-secretase activity, we show a complex chain of regulatory events, resulting in impaired beta-secretase trafficking and membrane localization upon protein kinase C (PKC) activation by ATRA. Furthermore, ATRA demonstrates substrate specificity for beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme (BACE) 1 over nonamyloidogenic BACE2 in beta-secretase regulation, which probably promotes competition for amyloid precursor protein between ADAM17 and BACE1. Additionally, we report enhanced secretion of soluble amyloid precursor protein alpha after ATRA exposure, possibly due to PKC activation, as pretreatment with the PKC inhibitor Gö6976 abolished all these events.","1742-4658","The FEBS journal","(276) 2645-55",2009,"Anna","Koryakina","A","Institute of Pharmaceutical Biology, University of Basel, Switzerland."

Cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein by the beta-secretase, BACE1, is the first step in the production of the Abeta peptide and is a prime target for therapeutic intervention. Using circular dichroism, we reveal that the secondary structure of BACE1 in a membrane environment is significantly different from what was determined from the previously resolved crystal structure, and, we provide the first evidence that show differences in stability between the active (pH 4.8) and inactive (pH 7.4) forms of BACE1. In this study we have also examined Ca(2+) binding to BACE1, the effect of this binding on the secondary and tertiary structural characteristics of BACE1, and the influence of this binding on the specific activity of the purified protein. Circular dichroism and endogenous tryptophan fluorescence measurements demonstrated that the secondary and tertiary structures, respectively, are sensitive to increasing concentrations of Ca(2+). Isothermal titration calorimetry was then used to characterize the Ca(2+)-BACE1 interaction in more detail. Our results suggest that there is a high affinity of binding (k(d) = 2.0 x microM) between Ca(2+) and BACE1 and that the binding process was exothermic (DeltaH= -3.5 kcal/mol). We also could demonstrate that low concentrations of Ca(2+) (microM range) significantly increased the proteolytic activity of BACE1. Collectively, these results identify a direct interaction between BACE1 and Ca(2+) and suggest that under physiological conditions, the function(s) of BACE1 must also be influenced by Ca(2+).","0006-3002","Biochimica et biophysica acta","(1788) 1933-8",2009,"Michael","Hayley","M","Department of Biophysical Chemistry, Biozentrum, University of Basel, 4056 Basel, Switzerland. michael.hayley@unibas.ch"

Although BACE1 is expressed primarily in neurons, which are a principal source of Abeta in the brain, the mechanism that underlies basal expression of BACE1 in neurons has not been studied thoroughly. In the present study, we found that endogenous BACE1 expression was mediated by constitutive JAK2/STAT1 activation in neurons. Inhibition of the JAK2/STAT1 signaling pathway, using AG490 (a JAK2 inhibitor), a dominant-negative form of STAT1, and SOCS1 and SOCS3 overexpression, reduced levels of BACE1 promoter activity, expression of endogenous BACE1, and generation of Abeta. These results were recapitulated in the SH-SY5Y neuronal cell line, primary cultured neurons, and mouse brains. Therefore, we propose that constitutive JAK2/STAT1 activation mediates endogenous BACE1 expression in neurons and that inhibition of JAK2/STAT1 signaling abrogates basal levels of BACE1 expression and Abeta generation.","1090-2104","Biochemical and biophysical research communications","(386) 175-80",2009,"Hyun Jin","Cho","HJ","Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Jongrogu, Seoul, Republic of Korea."
19519664,"Differential effects of gamma-secretase and BACE1 inhibition on brain Abeta levels in vitro and in vivo.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is hypothesized to result from elevated brain levels of beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) which is the main component of plaques found in AD brains and which cause memory impairment in mice. Therefore, there has been a major focus on the development of inhibitors of the Abeta producing enzymes gamma-secretase and beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1). In this study, we investigated the Abeta-lowering effects of the BACE1 inhibitor LY2434074 in vitro and in vivo, comparing it to the well characterized gamma-secretase inhibitor LY450139. We sampled interstitial fluid Abeta from awake APPswe/PS1dE9 AD mice by in vivo Abeta microdialysis. In addition, we measured levels of endogenous brain Abeta extracted from wildtype C57BL/6 mice. In our in vitro assays both compounds showed similar Abeta-lowering effects. However, while systemic administration of LY450139 resulted in transient reduction of Abeta in both in vivo models, we were unable to show any Abeta-lowering effect by systemic administration of the BACE1 inhibitor LY2434074 despite brain exposure exceeding the in vitro IC(50) value several fold. In contrast, significant reduction of 40-50% of interstitial fluid Abeta and wildtype cortical Abeta was observed when infusing LY2434074 directly into the brain by means of reverse microdialysis or by dosing the BACE1 inhibitor to p-glycoprotein (p-gp) mutant mice. The effects seen in p-gp mutant mice and subsequent data from our cell-based p-gp transport assay suggested that LY2434074 is a p-gp substrate. This may partly explain why BACE1 inhibition by LY2434074 has lower in vivo efficacy, with respect to decreased Abeta40 levels, compared with gamma-secretase inhibition by LY450139.","1471-4159","Journal of neurochemistry","(110) 1377-87",2009,"Anders Brandt","Elvang","AB","Department of In Vivo Neurobiology-Neurodegeneration, H.

Disruption of miRNA-based post-transcriptional regulation has been implicated in a range of CNS disorders as one miRNA is predicted to impact the expression of numerous downstream mRNA targets. The intricate molecular networks mediated by an miRNA form a robust mechanism for rapid and potent responses to cellular events throughout the development of the human brain.

COL25A1 mice displayed reduced anxiety-like behavior in elevated plus maze and open field tests and significantly slower swimming speed in Morris water maze. In stable cell lines, motifs in noncollagenous domains of COL25A1 were important for the induction of BACE1 expression. These findings demonstrate that COL25A1 leads to AD-like pathology in vivo.

PrP(C) is bound to the plasma membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor, although a secreted, soluble form has also been identified. Previously we reported that PrP(C) is subject to ectodomain shedding from the membrane by zinc metalloproteinases with a similar inhibition profile to those involved in shedding the amyloid precursor protein. Here we have used gain-of-function (overexpression) and loss-of-function (small interfering RNA knockdown) experiments in cells to identify the ADAMs (a disintegrin and metalloproteinases) involved in the ectodomain shedding of PrP(C). These experiments revealed that ADAM9 and ADAM10, but not ADAM17, are involved in the shedding of PrP(C) and that ADAM9 exerts its effect on PrP(C) shedding via ADAM10. Using dominant negative, catalytically inactive mutants, we show that the catalytic activity of ADAM9 is required for its effect on ADAM10. Mass spectrometric analysis revealed that ADAM10, but not ADAM9, cleaved PrP between Gly(228) and Arg(229), three residues away from the site of glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor attachment. The shedding of another membrane protein, the amyloid precursor protein beta-secretase BACE1, by ADAM9 is also mediated via ADAM10. Furthermore, we show that pharmacological inhibition of PrP(C) shedding or activation of both PrP(C) and PrP(Sc) shedding by ADAM10 overexpression in scrapie-infected neuroblastoma N2a cells does not alter the formation of proteinase K-resistant PrP(Sc). Collectively, these data indicate that although PrP(C) can be shed through the action of ADAM family members, modulation of PrP(C) or PrP(Sc) ectodomain shedding does not regulate prion conversion.","1083-351X","The Journal of biological chemistry","(284) 22590-600",2009,"David R","Taylor","DR","Proteolysis Research Group, Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Faculty of Biological Sciences, University of Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, United Kingdom."

However, very little is known regarding the post-transcriptional processes that operate within the different classes of RNA molecules. To characterize the post-transcriptional properties of expressed sequences from human chromosome 21 (HSA21), we separated RNA molecules from three cell lines (GM06990, HeLa S3, and SK-N-AS) according to their ribosome content by sucrose gradient fractionation. Polyribosomal-associated RNA and total RNA were subsequently hybridized to genomic tiling arrays. We found that approximately 50% of the transcriptional signals were located outside of annotated exons and were considered as TARs (transcriptionally active regions). Although TARs were observed among polysome-associated RNAs, RT-PCR and RACE experiments revealed that approximately 40% were likely to represent nonspecific cross-hybridization artifacts. Bioinformatics discrimination of TARs according to conservation and sequence complexity allowed us to identify a set of high-confidence TARs. This set of TARs was significantly depleted in the polysomes, suggesting that it was not likely to be involved in translation. Analysis of polysome representation of RefSeq exons showed that at least 15% of RefSeq transcripts undergo significant post-transcriptional regulation in at least two of the three cell lines tested. Among the regulated transcripts, enrichment analysis revealed an over-representation of genes involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD), including APP and the BACE1 protease that cleaves APP to produce the pathogenic beta 42 peptide. We demonstrate that the combination of RNA fractionation and tiling arrays is a powerful method to assess the transcriptional and post-transcriptional properties of genomic regions.","1088-9051","Genome research","(19) 1471-9",2009,"Sergey I","Nikolaev","SI","Department of Genetic Medicine and Development, University of Geneva Medical School, Geneva, Switzerland."

To determine if caffeine intake can have beneficial effects in ""aged"" APPsw mice already demonstrating cognitive impairment, we administered caffeine in the drinking water of 18-19 month old APPsw mice that were impaired in working memory. At 4-5 weeks into caffeine treatment, those impaired transgenic mice given caffeine (Tg/Caff) exhibited vastly superior working memory compared to the continuing impairment of control transgenic mice. In addition, Tg/Caff mice had substantially reduced Abeta deposition in hippocampus (decrease 40%) and entorhinal cortex (decrease 46%), as well as correlated decreases in brain soluble Abeta levels. Mechanistically, evidence is provided that caffeine suppression of BACE1 involves the cRaf-1/NFkappaB pathway. We also determined that caffeine concentrations within human physiological range effectively reduce active and total glycogen synthase kinase 3 levels in SweAPP N2a cells. Even with pre-existing and substantial Abeta burden, aged APPsw mice exhibited memory restoration and reversal of AD pathology, suggesting a treatment potential of caffeine in cases of established AD.","1875-8908","Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD","(17) 661-80",2009,"Gary W","Arendash","GW","Department of Cell Biology, Florida Alzheimer's Disease Research Center, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL 33620, USA. arendash@cas.usf.edu"

We compared profiles of AbetaPP mRNA, AbetaPP protein, and Abeta levels in rodents and primates. We also tracked a transcriptional regulator of the AbetaPP gene, specificity protein 1 (SP1), and the beta amyloid precursor cleaving enzyme (BACE1). In mice, AbetaPP and SP1 mRNA and their protein products were elevated late in life; Abeta levels declined in old age. In monkeys, SP1, AbetaPP, and BACE1 mRNA declined in old age, while protein products and Abeta levels rose. Proteolytic processing in both species did not match production of Abeta. In primates, AbetaPP and SP1 mRNA levels coordinate, but an inverse relationship exists with corresponding protein products as well as Abeta levels. Comparison of human DNA and mRNA sequences to monkey and mouse counterparts revealed structural features that may explain differences in transcriptional and translational processing.

19625507,"Reduced amyloid deposition in mice overexpressing RTN3 is adversely affected by preformed dystrophic neurites.","Reticulon 3 (RTN3) was initially identified as a negative modulator of BACE1, an enzyme that cleaves amyloid precursor protein (APP) to release beta-amyloid peptide. Interestingly, RTN3 can also form aggregates after accumulation, and increased RTN3 aggregation correlates with the formation of RTN3 immunoreactive dystrophic neurites (RIDNs) in brains of Alzheimer's cases. Transgenic mice expressing RTN3 alone develop RIDNs in their hippocampus but not in their cortex. To determine the in vivo effects of RTN3 and preformed RIDNs on amyloid deposition, we crossed bitransgenic mice expressing APP and presenilin 1 (PS1) mutations with mice overexpressing RTN3. We found that amyloid deposition in cortex, the hippocampal CA3 region, and dentate gyrus was significantly reduced in triple transgenic mice compared with bitransgenic controls. However, reduction of amyloid deposition in the hippocampal CA1 region, where RIDNs predominantly formed before amyloid deposition, was less significant. Hence, preformed RTN3 aggregates in RIDNs clearly offset the negative modulation of BACE1 activity by RTN3. Furthermore, our study indicates that the increased expression of RTN3 could result in an alteration of BACE1 intracellular trafficking by retaining more BACE1 in the endoplasmic reticulum compartment where cleavage of APP by BACE1 is less favored. Our results suggest that inhibition of RTN3 aggregation is likely to be beneficial by reducing both amyloid deposition and the formation RIDNs.","1529-2401","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","(29) 9163-73",2009,"Qi","Shi","Q","Department of Neurosciences, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio 44195, USA."

As SAH is a potent inhibitor of all cellular methyltransferases, we herein examined the hypothesis that SAH may increase the formation of amyloid beta-peptide (Abeta) in BV-2 mouse microglial cells through hypomethylation of presenilin 1 protein (PS1) and beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), both of which cleave Abeta precursor protein (APP) to form Abeta. The results showed that SAH increased Abeta protein formation in a concentration-dependent manner (10-500 nM), and this effect of SAH was accompanied by significantly increased expression of APP and PS1 proteins, although SAH only significantly increased the expression of BACE1 at the highest concentration used (500 nM). SAH (500 nM) markedly induced hypomethylation of APP and PS1 gene promoters. Incubation of cells with 5'-azc (20 microM), also an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferases enhanced Abeta protein expression and APP and PS1 gene promoters hypomethylation. By contrast, pre-incubation of cells with betaine (1.0 mM), 30 min followed by incubation with SAH (500 nM) or 5'-azc (20 microM) for 24h markedly prevented the expression of Abeta protein (by 50%, P<0.05) and the gene promoter hypomethylation of APP and PS1.

Non-synonymous SNPs of interest were also included. Genotyping was performed by Sequenom iPLEX and TaqMan technologies. Alleles, genotypes and multi-marker haplotypes were tested for association with AD, and platelet beta-secretase activities were measured for a subset of individuals (n = 231). Eight SNPs in RTN3 and 7 in PPIL2 were genotyped. We found no significant associations between allele, genotype or haplotype frequencies and risk of AD. Further, there was no effect of genotype on platelet membrane beta-secretase activity.

These processes lead to the formation of 40-42 amino acids long Alzheimer amyloid beta (Abeta) peptides (Abeta40 and Abeta42, respectively). In the absence of an X-ray structure of PS1, based on the substrate specificity and structural characteristics of the active site, another aspartyl protease BACE1 was selected as a model for PS1. The general acid/base mechanism utilized by PS1 is divided into the following two steps: (1) formation of the gem-diol intermediate, and (2) cleavage of the Val-Ile or Ala-Thr peptide bond. The MD simulations indicate that the electronic nature of the cleavage site (Val-Ile and Ala-Thr) plays a critical role in the formation of the enzyme-substrate complex. The calculated barrier (at B3LYP level) for the generation of the gem-diol intermediate in the Val-Ile and Ala-Thr peptide bond cleaving pathways is 16.6 and 24.4 kcal/mol, respectively, and it is endothermic by 6.2 and 17.4 kcal/mol, respectively. This step is the rate-limiting step in both reactions. In the second step, the splitting of the Val-Ile and Ala-Thr bonds encounters the barrier of 10.9 and 21.3 kcal/mol, respectively.

We previously reported that RanBP9 promotes Abeta generation by scaffolding APP/BACE1/LRP complexes together. Interestingly, the RanBP9-Delta1/N60 (residues 1-392) deletion mutant interacted much more strongly with APP/BACE1/LRP than full-length RanBP9. In this study, we found that RanBP9-N60, a processed form of RanBP9 virtually identical to the RanBP9-Delta1/N60 mutant, was strongly increased in AD brains compared with controls. To evaluate the potential pathogenic consequences of this phenotype, we studied the differential biological properties of full-length RanBP9 vs. RanBP9-Delta1/N60 in HEK293T and Neuro-2A cells. The RanBP9-Delta1/N60 fragment, which lacks a nuclear localization signal, displayed enhanced cytoplasmic vs. nuclear localization and >3-fold enhanced stability than full-length RanBP9. Importantly, RanBP9-Delta1/N60, which contains the LisH dimerization domain, retained the capacity to form self-interacting multimeric complexes and increased Abeta generation by approximately 5-fold over vector controls, more potent than the approximately 3-fold increase seen by full-length RanBP9. Taken together, these data indicate that RanBP9-N60 may further drive the amyloid cascade in AD and that the proteolytic processing of RanBP9 may be an attractive therapeutic target.","1530-6860","FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology","(24) 119-27",2010,"Madepalli K","Lakshmana","MK","Department of Neurosciences, University of California-San Diego, 9500 Gilman Dr., La Jolla, CA 92093, USA."

19738368,"Destruxin E decreases Beta-amyloid generation by reducing colocalization of beta-amyloid-cleaving enzyme 1 and beta-amyloid protein precursor.","Alzheimer-disease-associated beta-amyloid (Abeta) is produced by sequential endoproteolysis of beta-amyloid protein precursor (betaAPP): the extracellular portion is shed by cleavage in the juxtamembrane region by beta-amyloid-cleaving enzyme (BACE)/beta-secretase, after which it is cleaved by presenilin (PS)/gamma-secretase near the middle of the transmembrane domain. Thus, inhibition of either of the secretases reduces Abeta generation and is a fundamental strategy for the development of drugs to prevent Alzheimer disease. However, it is not clear how small compounds reduce Abeta production without inhibition of the secretases. Such compounds are expected to avoid some of the side effects of secretase inhibitors. Here, we report that destruxin E (Dx-E), a natural cyclic hexadepsipeptide, reduces Abeta generation without affecting BACE or PS/gamma-secretase activity. In agreement with this, Dx-E did not inhibit Notch signaling. We found that Dx-E decreases colocalization of BACE1 and betaAPP, which reduces beta-cleavage of betaAPP. Therefore, the data demonstrate that Dx-E represents a novel Abeta-reducing process which could have fewer side effects than secretase inhibitors.","1660-2862","Neuro-degenerative diseases","(6) 230-9",2009,"Naohiro","Itoh","N","Psychiatry, Department of Integrated Medicine, Division of Internal Medicine, Osaka University Graduate School of Medicine, Osaka 565-0871, Japan."
19747481,"Signaling effect of amyloid-beta(42) on the processing of AbetaPP.","The effects of amyloid-beta are extremely complex. Current work in the field of Alzheimer disease is focusing on discerning the impact between the physiological signaling effects of soluble low molecular weight amyloid-beta species and the more global cellular damage that could derive from highly concentrated and/or aggregated amyloid. Being able to dissect the specific signaling events, to understand how soluble amyloid-beta induces its own production by up-regulating BACE1 expression, could lead to new tools to interrupt the distinctive feedback cycle with potential therapeutic consequences. Here we describe a positive loop that exists between the secretases that are responsible for the generation of the amyloid-beta component of Alzheimer disease. According to our hypothesis, in familial Alzheimer disease, the primary overproduction of amyloid-beta can induce BACE1 transcription and drive a further increase of amyloid-beta precursor protein processing and resultant amyloid-beta production. In sporadic Alzheimer disease, many factors, among them oxidative stress and inflammation, with consequent induction of presenilins and BACE1, would activate a loop and proceed with the generation of amyloid-beta and its signaling role onto BACE1 transcription. This concept of a signaling effect by and feedback on the amyloid-beta precursor protein will likely shed light on how amyloid-beta generation, oxidative stress, and secretase functions are intimately related in sporadic Alzheimer disease.","1090-2430","Experimental neurology","(221) 18-25",2010,"Massimo","Tabaton","M","Departments of Neuroscience, Ophthalmology, and Genetics, University of Genova, Genova, Italy. mtabaton@neurologia.unige.it"

Results presented herein demonstrated that, like brain cells, cultured skin fibroblasts from AD patients contained more cholesterol esters than fibroblasts from healthy subjects. Particularly, Oil Red-O, Nile Red, and filipin staining highlighted higher levels of neutral lipids which responded to inhibitors of acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyl-transferase (ACAT-1), associated with an increase in free cholesterol. ACAT-1 mRNA levels increased significantly in AD fibroblasts, whereas those of sterol regulatory element binding protein-2, neutral cholesterol ester hydrolase, and ATP-binding cassette transporter member 1 were markedly down-regulated. Instead, mRNA levels of low-density lipoprotein receptor, hydroxy-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, caveolin-1, and amyloid-beta protein precursor (AbetaPP) were virtually unchanged. Notably, mRNA levels of both beta-site AbetaPP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and neprilysin were significantly down-regulated. An increase in Abeta(40) and Abeta(42) immunostaining and a decrease in BACE1 active form were also found in AD versus control fibroblasts. Altogether, these findings support the hypothesis that the derangement of cholesterol homeostasis is a systemic alteration involving central but also peripheral cells of AD patients, and point to cholesterol ester levels in AD fibroblasts as an additional metabolic hallmark useful in the laboratory and clinical practice.","1875-8908","Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD","(18) 829-41",2009,"Alessandra","Pani","A","Department of Biomedical Sciences and Technologies, University of Cagliari, 09100 Cagliari, Italy."

While beta-secretase shedding of Swedish APP (APPswe) largely results from an activity localized in the late secretory pathway, cleavage of wild-type APP occurs mainly in endocytic compartments. However, we show that liberation of Abeta from APPswe is still dependent on functional internalization from the cell surface. Inspite the unchanged overall beta-secretase cleaved soluble APP released from APP(swe) secretion, mutations of the APPswe internalization motif strongly reduced C99 levels and substantially decreased Abeta secretion. We point out that alpha-secretase activity-mediated conversion of C99 to C83 is the main cause of this Abeta reduction. Furthermore, we demonstrate that alpha-secretase cleavage of C99 even contributes to the reduction of Abeta secretion of internalization deficient wild-type APP. Therefore, inhibition of alpha-secretase cleavage increased Abeta secretion through diminished conversion of C99 to C83 in APP695, APP695swe or C99 expressing cells.","1471-4159","Journal of neurochemistry","(111) 1369-82",2009,"Sebastian","Jäger","S","Molecular Neurodegeneration Group, Institute of Physiological Chemistry and Pathobiochemistry, Johannes Gutenberg-University Mainz, Mainz, Germany."

Seladin-1 protects cells against beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide 42- and oxidative stress-induced apoptosis activated by caspase-3, a key mediator of apoptosis. Here, we have employed RNA interference to assess the molecular effects of seladin-1 down-regulation on the beta-secretase (BACE1) function and beta-amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells in both normal and apoptotic conditions. Our results show that approximately 60% reduction in seladin-1 protein levels, resembling the decrease observed in AD brain, did not significantly affect APP processing or Abeta secretion in normal growth conditions. However, under apoptosis, seladin-1 small interfering RNA (siRNA)-transfected cells showed increased caspase-3 activity on average by 2-fold when compared with control siRNA-transfected cells. Increased caspase-3 activity coincided with a significant depletion of the BACE1-sorting protein, GGA3 (Golgi-localized gamma-ear-containing ADP-ribosylation factor-binding protein), and subsequently augmented BACE1 protein levels and activity. Augmented BACE1 activity in turn correlated with the enhanced beta-amyloidogenic processing of APP and ultimately increased Abeta production. These adverse changes associated with decreased cell viability in seladin-1 siRNA-transfected cells under apoptosis. No changes in GGA3 or BACE1 levels were found after seladin-1 knockdown in normal growth conditions. Collectively, our results suggest that under stress conditions, reduced seladin-1 expression results in enhanced GGA3 depletion, which further leads to augmented post-translational stabilization of BACE1 and increased beta-amyloidogenic processing of APP. These mechanistic findings related to seladin-1 down-regulation are important in the context of AD as the oxidative stress-induced apoptosis plays a key role in the disease pathogenesis.","1083-351X","The Journal of biological chemistry","(284) 34433-43",2009,"Timo","Sarajärvi","T","Department of Neurology, University of Kuopio and Kuopio University Hospital, FIN-70211 Kuopio, Finland."

However, the in vivo function of BACE2 has not yet been elucidated. The aim of the present work has been to analyse the impact of in vivo BACE2 overexpression using a transgenic mouse model. Our results suggest that BACE2 is not involved in the amyloidogenic pathway, cognitive dysfunction or cholinergic degeneration.

In this study, we examined whether caspase-3 activation participates in the regulation of UBB(+1) generation and UBB(+1)-mediated BACE1 stability in ischemic injured brains. The results showed that UBB(+1) and activated caspase-3-immunopositive-stained cells were time dependently increased in the ipsilateral striatum of rat brains after middle cerebral artery occlusion. UBB(+1)-immunopositive cells could be co-stained with caspase-3, Abeta (UBB(+1)-Abeta), and BACE1 (UBB(+1)-BACE1). BACE1 protein could also be pulled down by immunoprecipitation with UBB(+1) antibody. Z-DEVD-FMK (DEVD), a caspase-3 inhibitor, significantly decreased the level of UBB(+1) protein and the number of UBB(+1)-Abeta and UBB(+1)-BACE1 double-stained cells in the ischemic striatum, as well as the level of UBB(+1)/BACE1 protein complex. We conclude that activation of caspase-3 might be upstream of UBB(+1) formation and that excessive UBB(+1) could bind to BACE1 and increase the stability of BACE1, thereby increasing Abeta in ischemic injured brains. These results suggest new biological and pathological effects of caspases and regulation of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in the brain. Our results provide new therapeutic targets to prevent further neurodegeneration in patients after stroke.","1559-7016","Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism","(30) 566-75",2010,"Yong","Zhang","Y","Department of Neurobiology, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, State Key Laboratory of Medical Neurobiology, Shanghai Medical College of Fudan University, Shanghai 200032, People's Republic of China."
19885829,"Oxidative stress up-regulates presenilin 1 in lipid rafts in neuronal cells.","Oxidative stress is associated with beta-amyloid peptide (A beta) accumulation in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients. A beta is generated upon the sequential proteolytic cleavage of transmembrane amyloid precursor protein (APP) by two membrane-bound proteases, beta-secretase (BACE1) and the gamma-secretase complex comprising presenilin 1 (PS1), nicastrin, APH-1 and PEN-2. Recent evidence suggests that significant amounts of BACE1 and gamma-secretase components localize in the cholesterol-rich region of membranes known as lipid rafts, where A beta production occurs preferentially. In this study, we investigated the effects of oxidative stress on the BACE1 and gamma-secretase components in lipid rafts using human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells exposed to ethacrynic acid (EA), a compound that induces cellular glutathione depletion. Following exposure of cells to EA, heme oxygenase-1, a marker protein of oxidative stress, was strongly induced. Moreover, treatment with EA resulted in a significant increase in PS1 protein levels, but not those of nicastrin, APH-1, PEN-2 or BACE1, in both cell lysates and the lipid raft fraction. This increase in PS1 protein expression was prevented by co-treatment with an antioxidant, N-acetylcysteine (NAC). EA additionally induced a significant increase in PS1 mRNA expression, which was inhibited by NAC. Finally, EA treatment was found to promote A beta secretion from cells expressing Swedish mutant APP. It appears that in our cell culture model, oxidative stress enhances PS1 protein levels in lipid rafts via up-regulation of PS1 transcription, which may constitute the mechanism underlying the oxidative stress-associated promotion of A beta production.","1097-4547","Journal of neuroscience research","(88) 1137-45",2010,"Akiko","Oda","A","Department of Demyelinating Disease and Aging, National Institute of Neuroscience, NCNP, Tokyo, Japan."

Cathepsin D (CD) is a member of the aspartic protease family and has sequence similarity to BACE1. Therefore, we examined whether heparin and other glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) can influence the activity of CD. Heparin and other GAGs were found to stimulate the activity of recombinant proCD. Desulfation of heparin almost abolished the stimulation, indicating that sulfate groups were important for the stimulatory effect. In addition, the stimulation was dependent on the length of the GAG chain, as larger GAGs were more potent in their ability to stimulate proCD than shorter fragments. In the presence of heparin, limited autocatalytic proteolysis of the proenzyme was increased, suggesting that heparin increases the activity of proCD by accelerating the conversion of proCD, which has little activity, to pseudoCD, an active form lacking residues 1-26 of the prodomain. Furthermore, the activity of spleen-derived mature CD, which lacks the entire 44 amino acid residue prodomain, was also increased by heparin, indicating that the catalytic domain of CD contains at least one region to which GAGs bind and stimulate enzyme activity. Because heparin also stimulated the activity of pseudoCD, proenzyme activation was probably accelerated by the interaction of heparin with the catalytic domain of pseudoCD. However, it is possible that heparin may also activate the proenzyme directly. On the basis of this study, we propose that GAGs may regulate CD activity in vivo.","1742-4658","The FEBS journal","(276) 7343-52",2009,"Marie","Beckman","M","Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Monash University, Clayton, Australia. marie.beckman@sh.se"
19926793,"beta-Secretase inhibitor potency is decreased by aberrant beta-cleavage location of the ""Swedish mutant"" amyloid precursor protein.","The amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide, widely known as the causative molecule of Alzheimer disease (AD), is generated by the sequential cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the aspartyl proteases BACE1/beta-secretase and presenilin/gamma-secretase. Inhibition of BACE1, therefore, is a promising strategy for preventing the progression of AD. However, beta-secretase inhibitors (BSIs) exhibit unexpectedly low potency in cells expressing ""Swedish mutant"" APP (APPswe) and in the transgenic mouse Tg2576, an AD model overexpressing APPswe. The Swedish mutation dramatically accelerates beta-cleavage of APP and hence the generation of Abeta; this acceleration has been assumed to underlie the poor inhibitory activity of BSI against APPswe processing. Here, we studied the mechanism by which the Swedish mutation causes this BSI potency decrease. Surprisingly, decreased BSI potency was not observed in an in vitro assay using purified BACE1 and substrates, indicating that the accelerated beta-cleavage resulting from the Swedish mutation is not its underlying cause. By focusing on differences between the cell-based and in vitro assays, we have demonstrated here that the potency decrease is caused by the aberrant subcellular localization of APPswe processing and not by accelerated beta-cleavage or the accumulation of the C-terminal fragment of beta-cleaved APP. Because most patients with sporadic AD express wild type APP, our findings suggest that the wild type mouse is superior to the Tg2576 mouse as a model for determining the effective dose of BSI for AD patients. This work provides novel insights into the potency decrease of BSI and valuable suggestions for its development as a disease-modifying agent.","1083-351X","The Journal of biological chemistry","(285) 1634-42",2010,"Hidekuni","Yamakawa","H","From the Department of Life Sciences, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, University of Tokyo, Meguro-ku, Tokyo 153-8902, Japan."

Though BACE2 is also expressed in the brain, its potential role in AD has not been resolved. In this study, we compared the activities of both BACE1 and BACE2, which were isolated from the same samples of frontal cortex from both AD-affected individuals and age-matched controls. BACE1 activity showed a significant positive correlation with the amount of extractable Abeta, and BACE1 protein and activity were significantly increased in AD cases. Unexpectedly, there were substantial total amounts of BACE2 protein and enzymatic activity in the human brain. BACE2 activity did not change significantly in the AD brain, and was not related to Abeta concentration. These data indicate that BACE1 likely accounts for most of the Abeta produced in the human brain, and that BACE2 activity is not a likely contributor. However, as both forms of BACE compete for the same substrate pool, even small changes in BACE2 activity could have consequences for human disease.","1471-4159","Journal of neurochemistry","(112) 1045-53",2010,"Rachel R","Ahmed","RR","Department of Molecular and Cellular Biochemistry, University of Kentucky, Lexington, Kentucky, USA."

The amount of p25, an aberrant cleavage product of p35 that activates cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), is elevated in AD brains. The role of Cdk5 in neurotransmitter release has been well established. In this study, we examined whether p25 was linked to altered neurotransmitter release in AD. Transient or stable expression of p25 significantly increased basal secretion of human growth hormone (hGH) or neurotransmitter in PC12 cells. Expression of a p25 phosphorylation-deficient mutant, T138A, inhibited basal hGH secretion relative to the p25 wild type, suggesting the involvement of Thr138 phosphorylation in secretion. The expression and activity of beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), a key protease in the generation of beta-amyloid, are increased in AD brains. Our previous studies indicated that overexpression of BACE1 enhanced basal secretion of hGH in PC12 cells. Transient coexpression of p25 and BACE1 further stimulated spontaneous basal secretion. These results indicate a novel role for p25 in the secretory pathway and suggest that elevated levels of p25 and BACE1 in AD brains may contribute to altered neurotransmitter pathology of AD through enhancing spontaneous basal secretion.","0219-1032","Molecules and cells","(29) 51-6",2010,"Mi-Young","Son","MY","Graduate Program in Neuroscience, Institute for Brain Science and Technology, Inje University, Busan, 614-735, Korea."

Emerging evidence from mouse models has identified the importance of BACE1 in myelination and cognitive performance. However, the substrates that BACE1 processes to regulate these functions are unknown, and to date only a few beta-secretase substrates have been identified through candidate-based studies. Using an unbiased approach to substrate identification, we performed quantitative proteomic analysis of two human epithelial cell lines stably expressing BACE1 and identified 68 putative beta-secretase substrates, a number of which we validated in a cell culture system. The vast majority were of type I transmembrane topology, although one was type II and three were GPI-linked proteins. Intriguingly, a preponderance of these proteins are involved in contact-dependent intercellular communication or serve as receptors and have recognized roles in the nervous system and other organs. No consistent sequence motif predicting BACE1 cleavage was identified in substrates versus non-substrates.

The results indicated that 1-h MCAO significantly upregulated hippocampal NO and A beta levels. In addition, the NO elevation preceded the A beta changes. The Western blotting suggested that acute hypoperfusion could increase the expression of beta-secretase 1 (BACE1) but not BACE2. The enhanced NO concentration in acute stage of MCAO/R was coincident with increased eNOS expression, while in subacute stage was coincident with increased iNOS and nNOS. Our results also indicated that pretreatment of L-NAME, one non-selective NOS inhibitor could decrease the BACE1 expression, reverse both NO and A beta changes and rescue the delayed neuronal death. These preliminary findings indicated that activation of NOS/NO signaling system could trigger A beta production through BACE1 pathway during acute ischemic episode.

20066010,"A GPCR/secretase complex regulates beta- and gamma-secretase specificity for Abeta production and contributes to AD pathogenesis.","Dysregulation of beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme (BACE) and/or gamma-secretase leads to anomalous production of amyloid-beta peptide (Abeta) and contributes to the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Since these secretases mediate proteolytic processing of numerous proteins, little success has been achieved to treat AD by secretase inhibitors because of inevitable undesired side effects. Thus, it is of importance to unravel the regulatory mechanisms of these secretases. Here, we show that delta-opioid receptor (DOR) promotes the processing of Abeta precursor protein (APP) by BACE1 and gamma-secretase, but not that of Notch, N-cadherin or APLP. Further investigation reveals that DOR forms a complex with BACE1 and gamma-secretase, and activation of DOR mediates the co-endocytic sorting of the secretases/receptor complex for APP endoproteolysis. Dysfunction of the receptor retards the endocytosis of BACE1 and gamma-secretase and thus the production of Abeta. Consistently, knockdown or antagonization of DOR reduces secretase activities and ameliorates Abeta pathology and Abeta-dependent behavioral deficits, but does not affect the processing of Notch, N-cadherin or APLP in AD model mice. Our study not only uncovers a molecular mechanism for the formation of a DOR/secretase complex that regulates the specificity of secretase for Abeta production but also suggests that intervention of either formation or trafficking of the GPCR/secretase complex could lead to a new strategy against AD, potentially with fewer side effects.","1748-7838","Cell research","(20) 138-53",2010,"Lin","Teng","L","Laboratory of Molecular Cell Biology, Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200031, China."

BACE1 is synthesized as a partially active zymogen (proBACE1). We previously showed that the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) heparin can increase the enzyme activity of proBACE1. In this study, the structural requirements and the mechanism for the GAG-induced activation were examined. The effect of heparin on proBACE1 was influenced by the degree of sulfation and carboxylation of the GAG, as well as by the length of the sugar. Although low molecular weight heparin fragments did not strongly stimulate proBACE1, they inhibited heparin-induced activation of the enzyme. The structure of the zymogen was modeled using the known X-ray structures of the BACE1 catalytic domain and the homologous prodomain of porcine pepsinogen. The modeled structure suggested that a heparin-binding domain may reside close to the prodomain, and that movement of a loop region between residues 46-65, lying adjacent to the prodomain, may be needed to accommodate heparin binding. The presence of the loop domain adjacent to the active site may account for the lower activity of the zymogen relative to the mature enzyme. Movement of the loop region upon heparin binding could expose the active site region to allow for increased substrate binding. The results suggest a model in which conformational changes close to the prodomain may be involved in the mechanism of heparin-induced activation of proBACE1.","1471-4159","Journal of neurochemistry","(112) 1552-61",2010,"David W","Klaver","DW","Menzies Research Institute, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia."

In this study, we used heterozygous BACE1 gene knockout (BACE1+/-) mice to evaluate the effects of partial BACE1 suppression on different types of synaptic and cognitive dysfunctions in Alzheimer's transgenic mice (5XFAD model). We found that approximately 50% BACE1 reductions rescued deficits of 5XFAD mice not only in hippocampus-dependent memories as tested by contextual fear conditioning and spontaneous alternation Y-maze paradigms but also in cortex-dependent remote memory stabilization during 30 days after contextual conditioning. Furthermore, 5XFAD-associated impairments in long-term potentiation (a synaptic model of learning and memory) and declines in synaptic plasticity/learning-related brain-derived neurotrophic factor-tyrosine kinase B signaling pathways were prevented in BACE1+/-.5XFAD mice. Finally, these improvements were related with reduced levels of beta-secretase-cleaved C-terminal fragment (C99), Abeta peptides and plaque burden in relevant brain regions of BACE1+/-.5XFAD mice. Therefore, our findings provide compelling evidence for beneficial effects of partially BACE1-inhibiting approaches on multiple forms of functional defects associated with AD.","1471-4159","Journal of neurochemistry","(113) 248-61",2010,"Ryoichi","Kimura","R","Center for Dementia Research, Nathan Kline Institute, New York University School of Medicine, Orangeburg, New York 10962, USA."

However, multiple memory systems become impaired in AD as the disease progresses and it is important to test whether other forms of memory are affected in AD models. This study was designed to use conditioned taste aversion (CTA) and contextual fear conditioning paradigms to compare the phenotypes of hippocampus-independent and -dependent memory functions, respectively, in 5XFAD amyloid precursor protein/presenilin-1 transgenic mice that harbor five familial AD mutations. Although both types of memory were significantly impaired in 5XFAD mice, the onset of CTA memory deficits ( approximately 9 months of age) was delayed compared with that of contextual memory deficits ( approximately 6 months of age). Furthermore, 5XFAD mice that were genetically engineered to have reduced levels of beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) (BACE1(+/-).5XFAD) exhibited improved CTA memory, which was equivalent to the performance of wild-type controls. Importantly, elevated levels of cerebral beta-secretase-cleaved C-terminal fragment (C99) and Abeta peptides in 5XFAD mice were significantly reduced in BACE1(+/-).5XFAD mice. Furthermore, Abeta deposition in the insular cortex and basolateral amygdala, two brain regions that are critically involved in CTA performance, was also reduced in BACE1(+/-).5XFAD compared with 5XFAD mice. Our findings indicate that the CTA paradigm is useful for evaluating a hippocampus-independent form of memory defect in AD model mice, which is sensitive to rescue by partial reductions of the beta-secretase BACE1 and consequently of cerebral Abeta.","1460-9568","The European journal of neuroscience","(31) 110-8",2010,"Latha","Devi","L","Center for Dementia Research, Nathan Kline Institute, New York University School of Medicine, 140 Old Orangeburg Road, Orangeburg, NY 10962, USA."

However, the origin of extracellular beta-amyloid peptide (Abeta) deposits and the process of plaque development remain poorly understood. The present study attempted to explore plaque pathogenesis by localizing beta-secretase-1 (BACE1) elevation relative to Abeta accumulation and synaptic/neuritic alterations in the forebrain, using transgenic mice harboring familial AD (FAD) mutations (5XFAD and 2XFAD) as models. In animals with fully developed plaque pathology, locally elevated BACE1 immunoreactivity (IR) coexisted with compact-like Abeta deposition, with BACE1 IR occurring selectively in dystrophic axons of various neuronal phenotypes or origins (GABAergic, glutamatergic, cholinergic or catecholaminergic). Prior to plaque onset, localized BACE1/Abeta IR occurred at swollen presynaptic terminals and fine axonal processes. These BACE1/Abeta-containing axonal elements appeared to undergo a continuing process of sprouting/swelling and dystrophy, during which extracellular Abeta IR emerged and accumulated in surrounding extracellular space. These data suggest that BACE1 elevation and associated Abeta overproduction inside the sprouting/dystrophic axonal terminals coincide with the onset and accumulation of extracellular amyloid deposition during the development of neuritic plaques in transgenic models of AD. Our findings appear to be in harmony with an early hypothesis that axonal pathogenesis plays a key or leading role in plaque formation.","1460-9568","The European journal of neuroscience","(30) 2271-83",2009,"Xue-Mei","Zhang","XM","Department of Anatomy, Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, Carbondale, IL 62901, USA."

There has been suggestion of interaction between aluminum and several AD-associated pathways. However, the underlying mechanisms still remain unclear. Here, we report the effects of aluminum chloride (AlCl(3)) in Abeta-induced toxicity using differentiated neuronal SH-SY5Y cells. The metal significantly enhances Abeta-induced cell death at concentrations ranging from 50 to 300 microM after 24 and 48 h. After 72 and 96 h treatment, cell death is increased already at 10 microM. Early coexposure of cells to 10 microM AlCl(3) and 2 microM Abeta differentially affected beta-secretase mRNA levels as compared to single Abeta treatment after 1 and 3 h. BACE1 levels were slightly reduced after 1 h and significantly increased after 3 h exposure, whereas BACE2 levels were increased at both times considered. Both genes' mRNA levels were downregulated at longer times (6, 12, and 24 h). Although these results indicate that aluminum toxicity is correlated to changes in both BACE1 and BACE2 expression levels, the subsequent common downregulation observed suggests that aluminum involvement in the Abeta cascade is subtle, and other underlying mechanisms might be involved.","1573-6822","Cell biology and toxicology","(26) 367-77",2010,"Alessandro","Castorina","A","Department of Anatomy, Diagnostic Pathology, Legal Medicine, Hygiene and Public Health, University of Catania, Catania, Italy."

In this work we tested whether cholesterol accumulation upon NPC1 dysfunction, which causes Niemann Pick type C disease (NPC), causes increased partitioning of APP into lipid rafts leading to increased CTF/Abeta formation in these cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains. To test this we used CHO NPC1(-/-) cells (NPC cells) and parental CHOwt cells. By sucrose density gradient centrifugation we observed a shift in fl-APP/CTF compartmentalization into lipid raft fractions upon cholesterol accumulation in NPC vs. wt cells. Furthermore, gamma-secretase inhibitor treatment significantly increased fl-APP/CTF distribution in raft fractions in NPC vs. wt cells, suggesting that upon cholesterol accumulation in NPC1-null cells increased formation of APP-CTF and its increased processing towards Abeta occurs in lipid rafts. Our results support that cholesterol overload, such as in NPC disease, leads to increased partitioning of APP/CTF into lipid rafts resulting in increased amyloidogenic processing of APP in these cholesterol-rich membranes.

20163459,"beta-Secretase cleavage is not required for generation of the intracellular C-terminal domain of the amyloid precursor family of proteins.","The amyloid precursor family of proteins are of considerable interest, both because of their role in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis and because of their normal physiological functions. In mammals, the amyloid precursor protein (APP) has two homologs, amyloid precursor-like protein (APLP) 1 and APLP2. All three proteins undergo ectodomain shedding and regulated intramembrane proteolysis, and important functions have been attributed to the full-length proteins, shed ectodomains, C-terminal fragments and intracellular domains (ICDs). One of the proteases that is known to cleave APP and that is essential for generation of the amyloid beta-protein is the beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1). Here, we investigated the effects of genetic manipulation of BACE1 on the processing of the APP family of proteins. BACE1 expression regulated the levels and species of full-length APLP1, APP and APLP2, of their shed ectodomains, and of their membrane-bound C-terminal fragments. In particular, APP processing appears to be tightly regulated, with changes in beta-cleaved APPs (APPsbeta) being compensated for by changes in alpha-cleaved APPs (APPsalpha). In contrast, the total levels of soluble cleaved APLP1 and APLP2 species were less tightly regulated, and fluctuated with BACE1 expression. Importantly, the production of ICDs for all three proteins was not decreased by loss of BACE1 activity. These results indicate that BACE1 is involved in regulating ectodomain shedding, maturation and trafficking of the APP family of proteins. Consequently, whereas inhibition of BACE1 is unlikely to adversely affect potential ICD-mediated signaling, it may alter other important facets of amyloid precursor-like protein/APP biology.","1742-4658","The FEBS journal","(277) 1503-18",2010,"Carlo","Sala Frigerio","C","Laboratory for Neurodegenerative Research, The Conway Institute for Biomolecular and Biomedical Research, University College Dublin, Republic of Ireland."

Patients were classified according to their Abeta(42), t-tau, and p-tau CSF biomarker levels, with either an AD-like biomarker profile (two or three biomarkers abnormal: Abeta(42) < 495 pg/ml in combination with t-tau > 356 pg/ml, and/or p-tau > 54 pg/ml) or a normal biomarker profile (<or= one biomarker abnormal). This resulted in 19 subjects with an AD-like biomarker profile (66 +/- 6 years, 53% female, and Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) score: 23 +/- 5) and 28 subjects with a normal biomarker profile (62 +/- 11 years, 43% female, and MMSE score: 27 +/- 4). Subjects with an AD-like biomarker profile had higher CSF BACE1 activity levels, compared to patients with a normal biomarker profile (20 pg/ml and 16 pg/ml respectively; p=0.01), when controlled for age and gender. In the whole sample, BACE1 activity correlated with CSF levels of Abeta(40), t-tau, and p-tau (r=0.38, r=0.63, and r=0.65; all p< 0.05), but not with Abeta(42). These data suggest that increased BACE1 activity in CSF relates to AD pathology in the brain.","1875-8908","Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD","(20) 253-60",2010,"Sandra D","Mulder","SD","Department of Clinical Chemistry, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. sd.mulder@vumc.nl"

20182419,"Interactions between age, stress and insulin on cognition: implications for Alzheimer's disease.","There is much interest in understanding the mechanisms responsible for interactions among stress, aging, memory and Alzheimer's disease. Glucocorticoid secretion associated with early life stress may contribute to the variability of the aging process and to the development of neuro- and psychopathologies. Maternal separation (MS), a model of early life stress in which rats experience 3 h of daily separation from the dam during the first 3 weeks of life, was used to study the interactions between stress and aging. Young (3 months) MS rats showed an altered hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis reactivity, depressive-like behavior in the Porsolt swimming test and cognitive impairments in the Morris water maze and new object recognition test that persisted in aged (18 months) rats. Levels of insulin receptor, phosphorylated insulin receptor and markers of downstream signaling pathways (pAkt, pGSK3 beta, pTau, and pERK1 levels) were significantly decreased in aged rats. There was a significant decrease in pERK2 and in the plasticity marker ARC in MS aged rats compared with single MS or aged rats. It is interesting to note that there was a significant increase in the C99 : C83 ratio, A beta levels, and BACE1 levels the hippocampus of MS aged rats, suggesting that in aged rats subjected to early life stress, there was an increase in the amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP). These results are integrated in a tentative mechanism through which aging interplay with stress to influence cognition as the basis of Alzheimer disease (AD). The present results may provide the proof-of-concept for the use of glucocorticoid-/insulin-related drugs in the treatment of AD.","1740-634X","Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology","(35) 1664-73",2010,"Maite","Solas","M","Department of Pharmacology, School of Medicine, Center for Applied Medical Research, University of Navarra, Pamplona, Spain."

Both are multifunctional proteins with roles in a variety of neurodevelopmental processes, including progenitor cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation. Here, we provide evidence linking these factors together in a single pathway, which is mediated by ErbB receptors and PI3K/Akt. We show that signaling by NRG1 and NRG2, but not NRG3, increase expression of an isoform of DISC1 in vitro. Receptors ErbB2 and ErbB3, but not ErbB4, are responsible for transducing this effect, and PI3K/Akt signaling is also required. In NRG1 knockout mice, this DISC1 isoform is selectively reduced during neurodevelopment. Furthermore, a similar decrease in DISC1 expression is seen in beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE1) knockout mice, in which NRG1/Akt signaling is reportedly impaired. In contrast to neuronal DISC1 that was reported and characterized, expression of DISC1 in other types of cells in the brain has not been addressed. Here we demonstrate that DISC1, like NRG and ErbB proteins, is expressed in neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and radial progenitors. These findings may connect NRG1, ErbBs, Akt, and DISC1 in a common pathway, which may regulate neurodevelopment and contribute to susceptibility to schizophrenia.","1091-6490","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","(107) 5622-7",2010,"Saurav","Seshadri","S","Departments of Psychiatry, Neuroscience, and Pathology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21287, USA."

As such, lentiviral-expressed siRNA against BACE1 is a therapeutic possibility in the treatment of Alzheimer disease.

Its muscle-fiber phenotype shares several molecular similarities with Alzheimer-disease (AD) brain, including increased AbetaPP, accumulation of amyloid-beta (Abeta), and increased BACE1 protein. Abeta42 is prominently increased in AD brain and within s-IBM fibers, and its oligomers are putatively toxic to both tissues--accordingly, minimizing Abeta42 production can be a therapeutic objective in both tissues. The pathogenic development of s-IBM is unknown, including the mechanisms of BACE1 protein increase. BACE1 is an enzyme essential for production from AbetaPP of Abeta42 and Abeta40, which are proposed to be detrimental within s-IBM muscle fibers. Novel noncoding BACE1-antisense (BACE1-AS) was recently shown (a) to be increased in AD brain, and (b) to increase BACE1 mRNA and BACE1 protein. We studied BACE1-AS and BACE1 transcripts by real-time PCR (a) in 10 s-IBM and 10 age-matched normal muscle biopsies; and (b) in our established ER-Stress-Human-Muscle-Culture-IBM Model, in which we previously demonstrated increased BACE1 protein. Our study demonstrated for the first time that (a) in s-IBM biopsies BACE1-AS and BACE1 transcripts were significantly increased, suggesting that their increased expression can be responsible for the increase of BACE1 protein; and (b) experimental induction of ER stress significantly increased both BACE1-AS and BACE1 transcripts, suggesting that ER stress can participate in their induction in s-IBM muscle. Accordingly, decreasing BACE1 through a targeted downregulation of its regulatory BACE1-AS, or reducing ER stress, might be therapeutic strategies in s-IBM, assuming that it would not impair any normal cellular functions of BACE1.","1872-7972","Neuroscience letters","(474) 140-143",2010,"Anna","Nogalska","A","USC Neuromuscular Center, Department of Neurology, University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine, Good Samaritan Hospital, Los Angeles, CA, USA."

Using a proteomic approach based on in-cell chemical cross-linking and tandem affinity purification (TAP), we herein identify sorting nexin 6 (SNX6) as a BACE1-associated protein. SNX6, a PX domain protein, is a putative component of retromer, a multiprotein cargo complex that mediates the retrograde trafficking of the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CI-MPR) and sortilin. RNA interference suppression of SNX6 increased BACE1-dependent secretion of soluble APP (sAPPbeta) and cell-associated fragments (C99), resulting in increased Abeta secretion. Furthermore, SNX6 reduction led to elevated steady-state BACE1 levels as well as increased retrograde transport of BACE1 in the endocytic pathway, suggesting that SNX6 modulates the retrograde trafficking and basal levels of BACE1, thereby regulating BACE1-mediated APP processing and Abeta biogenesis. Our study identifies a novel cellular pathway by which SNX6 negatively modulates BACE1-mediated cleavage of APP.","1530-6860","FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology","(24) 2783-94",2010,"Hirokazu","Okada","H","Integrated Program in Cellular, Molecular, and Biophysical Studies, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, New York, USA."
20371462,"Modeling an anti-amyloid combination therapy for Alzheimer's disease.","As only symptomatic treatments are now available for Alzheimer's disease (AD), safe and effective mechanism-based therapies remain a great unmet need for patients with this neurodegenerative disease. Although gamma-secretase and BACE1 [beta-site beta-amyloid (Abeta) precursor protein (APP) cleaving enzyme 1] are well-recognized therapeutic targets for AD, untoward side effects associated with strong inhibition or reductions in amounts of these aspartyl proteases have raised concerns regarding their therapeutic potential. Although moderate decreases of either gamma-secretase or BACE1 are not associated with mechanism-based toxicities, they provide only modest benefits in reducing Abeta in the brains of APPswe/PS1DeltaE9 mice. Because the processing of APP to generate Abeta requires both gamma-secretase and BACE1, it is possible that moderate reductions of both enzymes would provide additive and significant protection against Abeta amyloidosis. Here, we test this hypothesis and assess the value of this novel anti-amyloid combination therapy in mutant mice. We demonstrate that genetic reductions of both BACE1 and gamma-secretase additively attenuate the amyloid burden and ameliorate cognitive deficits occurring in aged APPswe/PS1DeltaE9 animals. No evidence of mechanism-based toxicities was associated with such decreases in amounts of both enzymes. Thus, we propose that targeting both gamma-secretase and BACE1 may be an effective and safe treatment strategy for AD.","1946-6242","Science translational medicine","(2) 13ra1",2010,"Vivian W","Chow","VW","Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, 558 Ross Research Building, 720 Rutland Avenue, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA."

Reticulons are known to accumulate in the dystrophic neurites of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and studies have suggested that alterations in reticulons, such as increased aggregation, impair BACE1 binding, increasing amyloid-β production, and facilitating reticulon deposition in dystrophic neurites. To further characterize the cellular distribution of reticulon, we examined reticulon-3 expression in cases of AD, Parkinson's disease, and diffuse Lewy body disease. A more widespread cellular distribution of reticulon-3 was noted than in previous reports, including deposits in dystrophic neurites, neuropil threads, granulovacuolar degeneration, glial cells, morphologically normal neurons in both hippocampal pyramidal cell layer and cerebral neocortex, and specifically neurofibrillary tangles and Lewy bodies. These results are compatible with reticulon alterations as nonspecific downstream stress responses, consistent with its expression during periods of endoplasmic reticulum stress. This emphasizes the increasing recognition that much of the AD pathological spectrum represents a response to the disease rather than cause, and emphasizes the importance of examining upstream processes, such as oxidative stress, that have functional effects prior to the onset of structural alterations.","1440-1789","Neuropathology : official journal of the Japanese Society of Neuropathology","(30) 574-9",2010,"Jonathon E","Heath","JE","Department of Pathology, University of Maryland, Baltimore, Maryland, USA."

Whether and how brain/neuronal activity might modulate certain pathological processes of AD are interesting topics of recent clinical and basic research in the field, and may be of potential medical relevance in regard to both the disease etiology and intervention. Using the Tg2576 transgenic mouse model of AD, this study characterized a promotive effect of neuronal hypoactivity associated with functional deprivation on amyloid plaque pathogenesis in the olfactory pathway. Unilateral naris-occlusion caused beta-secretase-1 (BACE1) elevation in neuronal terminals in the deprived relative to the non-deprived bulb and piriform cortex in young adult mice. In parallel with the overall age-related plaque development in the forebrain, locally increased BACE1 immunoreactivity co-occurred with amyloid deposition first in the piriform cortex then within the bulb, more prominent on the deprived relative to the non-deprived side. Biochemical analyses confirmed elevated BACE1 protein levels, enzymatic activity and products in the deprived relative to non-deprived bulbs. Plaque-associated BACE1 immunoreactivity in the bulb and piriform cortex was localized preferentially to swollen/sprouting glutamatergic axonal terminals, with Abeta immunoreactivity occurring inside as well as around these terminals. Together, these findings suggest that functional deprivation or neuronal hypoactivity facilitates amyloid plaque formation in the forebrain in a transgenic model of AD, which operates synergistically with age effect. The data also implicate an intrinsic association of amyloid accumulation and plaque formation with progressive axonal pathology.","1460-9568","The European journal of neuroscience","(31) 710-21",2010,"Xue-Mei","Zhang","XM","Department of Anatomy, Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, Carbondale, IL 62901, USA."

Moreover, chalcones and flavonols were reported to exert higher bioactivities than flavanones. These findings have led to a further search for other possible constituents potentially contributing to the strong inhibitory activity of the S. flavescens extract. In this study, BACE1 activities were significantly inhibited by 8-lavandulylkaempferol (IC(50) 7.29 microM), kuraridinol (IC(50) 7.10 microM), kuraridin (IC(50) 6.03 microM), and kushenol C (IC(50) 5.45 microM) from the ethyl acetate fraction, along with desmethylanhydroicaritin (IC(50) 1.86 microM), xanthohumol (IC(50) 7.19 microM), and leachianone G (IC(50) 8.56 microM) from the dichloromethane fraction of the extract. The results indicate that the prenyl group, rather than the lavandulyl group, and the flavonols and chalcones, rather than flavanones, might make predominant contributions to BACE1 inhibition. In particular, 8-lavandulylkaempferol exhibited significant inhibitory effects with IC(50) values of 7.10 and 8.11 microM for butyrylcholinesterase and acetylcholinesterase, respectively, when compared to its counterpart, desmethylanhydroicaritin. This indicates that the lavandulyl group might play a predominant role in both cholinesterase inhibitions. This is the first study indicating that prenylated flavonoids exert varying degrees of inhibition primarily through their skeleton (flavonols, chalcones, flavanones), as well as their lipophilic chain length (prenyl and lavandulyl groups). Therefore, S. flavescens and its prenylated flavonoids, possessing low molecular weights and lipophilic moieties may be potent preventive and therapeutic candidates for Alzheimer's disease.","1793-6853","The American journal of Chinese medicine","(38) 415-29",2010,"Hyun Ah","Jung","HA","Division of Food Science and Biotechnology, Pukyong National University, Busan, Republic of Korea."

One of the typical hallmarks of AD is the deposition of senile plaque that is contributed mainly by amyloid-beta (Abeta), whose production is initiated by beta-site amyloid precursor protein (APP)-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1). Inhibition of BACE1 is thereby regarded as an attractive strategy for anti-AD drug discovery. Here, we reported that the natural product 2,2',4'-trihydroxychalcone (TDC) from Glycyrrhiza glabra functioned as a specific non-competitive inhibitor against BACE1 enzyme, and potently repressed beta-cleavage of APP and production of Abeta in human embryo kidney cells-APPswe cells. Moreover, the amelioration ability of this compound against the in vivo memory impairment was further evaluated by APP-PS1 double transgenic mice model. It is discovered that treatment of 9 mg/kg/day of TDC could obviously decrease Abeta production and Abeta plaque formation, while efficiently improve the memory impairment based on Morris water maze test.

We investigated CSF levels of the protease BACE1, which processes AbetaPP into Abeta, in relation to Cg-levels. Finally, we measured Cg levels in cell media from untreated and BACE1-inhibited SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells.

20451519,"Beyond the signaling effect role of amyloid-ß42 on the processing of APP, and its clinical implications.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) currently has over 6 million victims in the USA, alone. The recently FDA approved drugs for AD only provide mild, transient relief for symptoms without addressing underlying mechanisms to a significant extent. Basic understanding of the activities of the amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) and associated proteins such as beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is necessary to develop effective medical responses to AD. Recently (Exper. Neurol. 2010. 221, 18-25), Tabaton et al. have presented a model of both non-pathological and pathological Abeta activities and suggest potential therapeutic pathways based on their proposed framework of Abeta acting as the signal that induces a kinase cascade, ultimately stimulating transcription factors that upregulate genes such as BACE1. We respond by presenting evidence of Abeta's other activities, including protection against metal-induced reactive oxidizing species (ROS), modification of cholesterol transport, and potential activity as a transcription factor in its own right. We touch upon clinical implications of each of these functions and highlight the currently unexplored implications of our suggested novel function of Abeta as a transcription factor. Abeta appears to be a highly multi-functional peptide, and any or all of the pathways it engages in is a likely candidate for antiAD drug development.","1090-2430","Experimental neurology","(225) 51-4",2010,"Debomoy K","Lahiri","DK","Department of Psychiatry, Institute of Psychiatric Research, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN 46202, USA. dlahiri@iupui.edu"

PCSK9 has also been shown to regulate the levels of additional membrane-bound proteins in vitro, including the very low-density lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR), apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (ApoER2) and the beta-site amyloid precursor protein (APP)-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), which are all highly expressed in the CNS and have been implicated in Alzheimer's disease. To better understand the role of PCSK9 in regulating these additional target proteins in vivo, their steady-state levels were measured in the brain of wild-type, PCSK9-deficient, and human PCSK9 overexpressing transgenic mice. We found that while PCSK9 directly bound to recombinant LDLR, VLDLR, and apoER2 protein in vitro, changes in PCSK9 expression did not alter the level of these receptors in the mouse brain. In addition, we found no evidence that PCSK9 regulates BACE1 levels or APP processing in the mouse brain. In conclusion, our results suggest that while PCSK9 plays an important role in regulating circulating LDL cholesterol levels by reducing the number of hepatic LDLRs, it does not appear to modulate the levels of LDLR and other membrane-bound proteins in the adult mouse brain.","1539-7262","Journal of lipid research","(51) 2611-8",2010,"Mali","Liu","M","Neurology Department, Merck Research Laboratories, West Point, PA, USA."

These methods can elucidate patterns between measures that can then be applied to discerning their validity in discriminating between experimental conditions. Here a hierarchical clustering method is used to analyze the results of an imaging genetics study using multiple brain morphology and cognitive testing endpoints for older adults with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or cognitive complaints (CC) compared to healthy controls (HC). The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are a subset of those included on a larger array that are found in a reported Alzheimer's disease (AD) and neurodegeneration pathway. The results indicate that genetic models within the endpoints cluster together, while there are 4 distinct sets of SNPs that differentiate between the endpoints, with most significant results associated with morphology endpoints rather than cognitive testing of patients' reported symptoms. The genes found in at least one cluster are ABCB1, APBA1, BACE1, BACE2, BCL2, BCL2L1, CASP7, CHAT, CST3, DRD3, DRD5, IL6, LRP1, NAT1, and PSEN2. The greater associations with morphology endpoints suggests that changes in brain structure can be influenced by an individual's genetic background in the absence of dementia and in some cases (Cognitive Complaints group) even without those effects necessarily being detectable on commonly used clinical tests of cognition. The results are consistent with polygenic influences on early neurodegenerative changes and demonstrate the effectiveness of hierarchical clustering in identifying genetic associations among multiple related phenotypic endpoints.","1552-485X","American journal of medical genetics.

The BACE1 C-terminal fragment contains a DXXLL motif that has been shown to bind the VHS (VPS27, Hrs, and STAM) domain of GGA1-3 (Golgi-localized gamma-ear-containing ARF-binding proteins). GGAs are trafficking molecules involved in the transport of proteins containing the DXXLL signal from the Golgi complex to endosomes. Moreover, GGAs bind ubiquitin and traffic synthetic and endosomal ubiquitinated cargoes to lysosomes. We have previously shown that depletion of GGA3 results in increased BACE1 levels and activity because of impaired lysosomal degradation. Here, we report that the accumulation of BACE1 is rescued by the ectopic expression of GGA3 in H4 neuroglioma cells depleted of GGA3. Accordingly, the overexpression of GGA3 reduces the levels of BACE1 and beta-amyloid. We then established that mutations in the GGA3 VPS27, Hrs, and STAM domain (N91A) or in BACE1 di-leucine motif (L499A/L500A), able to abrogate their binding, did not affect the ability of ectopically expressed GGA3 to rescue BACE1 accumulation in cells depleted of GGA3. Instead, we found that BACE1 is ubiquitinated at lysine 501 and is mainly monoubiquitinated and Lys-63-linked polyubiquitinated. Finally, a GGA3 mutant with reduced ability to bind ubiquitin (GGA3L276A) was unable to regulate BACE1 levels both in rescue and overexpression experiments. These findings indicate that levels of GGA3 tightly and inversely regulate BACE1 levels via interaction with ubiquitin sorting machinery.","1083-351X","The Journal of biological chemistry","(285) 24108-19",2010,"Eugene L","Kang","EL","Alzheimer's Disease Research Laboratory, Department of Neuroscience, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, MA 02111, USA."

In addition, we found, for the first time, a reduction of beta-secretase (BACE1) enzyme activity, mRNA level and protein expression in the male APP23/Ar(+/-) mice, suggesting that endogenous testosterone, independent from estrogen, may protect against AD in males via two major mechanisms, downregulation of BACE1 activities at transcriptional level to reduce beta amyloid production and upregulation of NEP activities to enhance bate amyloid degradation.","1529-2401","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","(30) 7326-34",2010,"Carrie","McAllister","C","Banner Sun Health Research Institute, Sun City, Arizona 85351, USA."

Our recent studies demonstrate pharmacogenetic differences in the effects of inhibitors of cathepsin B to improve memory and reduce Abeta in different mouse models of AD. The inhibitors improve memory and reduce brain Abeta in mice expressing the wild-type (WT) beta-secretase site of human APP, expressed in most AD patients. However, these inhibitors have no effect in mice expressing the rare Swedish (Swe) mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP). Knockout of the cathepsin B decreased brain Abeta in mice expressing WT APP, validating cathepsin B as the target. The specificity of cathepsin B to cleave the WT beta-secretase site, but not the Swe mutant site, of APP for Abeta production explains the distinct inhibitor responses in the different AD mouse models. In contrast to cathepsin B, the BACE1 beta-secretase prefers to cleave the Swe mutant site. Discussion of BACE1 data in the field indicate that they do not preclude cathepsin B as also being a beta-secretase. Cathepsin B and BACE1 could participate jointly as beta-secretases. Significantly, the majority of AD patients express WT APP and, therefore, inhibitors of cathepsin B represent candidate drugs for AD.","1437-4315","Biological chemistry","(391) 861-72",2010,"Vivian","Hook","V","Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093, USA. vhook@ucsd.edu"
20552043,"Oxidative stress mediates the pathogenic effect of different Alzheimer's disease risk factors.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder affecting the elderly population. Mechanistically, the major cause of the disease bases on the altered processing of the amyloid-beta (Abeta) precursor protein (APP), resulting in the accumulation and aggregation of neurotoxic forms of Abeta. Abeta derives from the sequential proteolytic cleavage of the beta- and gamma-secretases on APP. The causes of Abeta accumulation in the common sporadic form of AD are not completely known, but they are likely to include oxidative stress (OS). OS and Abeta are linked to each other since Abeta aggregation induces OS in vivo and in vitro, and oxidant agents increase the production of Abeta. Moreover, OS produces several effects that may contribute to synaptic function and cell death in AD. We and others have shown that the expression and activity of beta-secretase (named BACE1; beta-site APP cleaving enzyme) is increased by oxidant agents and by lipid peroxidation product 4-hydroxynonenal and that there is a significant correlation between BACE1 activity and oxidative markers in sporadic AD. OS results from several cellular insults such as aging, hyperglycemia, hypoxic insults that are all well known risk factors for AD development. Thus, our data strengthen the hypothesis that OS is a basic common pathway of Abeta accumulation, common to different AD risk factors.","1663-4365","Frontiers in aging neuroscience","(2) 3",2010,"Michela","Guglielmotto","M","Department of Experimental Medicine and Oncology, University of Turin Turin, Italy."

AD is considered to be a complex, multifactorial syndrome, with numerous causal factors contributing to its pathogenesis. Thus, for any novel therapeutic molecule to have a ""disease-modifying"" effect on AD, it must be able to modulate multiple, synergistic targets simultaneously. In this context, we have studied two compounds of plant origin [withanolide A (1) and asiatic acid (2)] for their potential activities against multiple targets associated with Abeta pathways (BACE1, ADAM10, IDE, and NEP). BACE1 is a rate-limiting enzyme in the production of Abeta from amyloid-beta precursor protein (AbetaPP), while ADAM10 is involved in non-amyloidogenic processing of AbetaPP. IDE and NEP are two of the prominent enzymes involved in effectively degrading Abeta. It was found that both 1 and 2 significantly down-regulated BACE1 and also up-regulated ADAM10 in primary rat cortical neurons. In addition, 1 significantly up-regulated IDE levels, which may help in degrading excess Abeta from the AD brain. On the basis of the data obtained, the two multifunctional compounds may prove valuable in developing novel, effective therapeutics for the prevention and treatment of AD-associated amyloid pathology.","1520-6025","Journal of natural products","(73) 1196-202",2010,"Sachin P","Patil","SP","Department of Chemical Engineering and Material Science, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824, USA."

Furthermore, population spikes were significantly increased in BACE1-null brain slices, indicating hyperexcitability of BACE1-null neurons.

Here we demonstrate a role of calpain in the neuropathology in amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin 1 (PS1) double-transgenic mice, an established mouse model of AD. We found that overexpression of endogenous calpain inhibitor calpastatin (CAST) under the control of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II promoter in APP/PS1 mice caused a remarkable decrease of amyloid plaque burdens and prevented Tau phosphorylation and the loss of synapses. Furthermore, CAST overexpression prevented the decrease in the phosphorylation of the memory-related molecules CREB and ERK in the brain of APP/PS1 mice and improved spatial learning and memory. Interestingly, treatment of cultured primary neurons with amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides caused an increase in the level of beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), the key enzyme responsible for APP processing and Abeta production. This effect was inhibited by CAST overexpression. Consistently, overexpression of calpain in heterologous APP expressing cells up-regulated the level of BACE1 and increased Abeta production. Finally, CAST transgene prevented the increase of BACE1 in APP/PS1 mice. Thus, calpain activation plays an important role in APP processing and plaque formation, probably by regulating the expression of BACE1.","1083-351X","The Journal of biological chemistry","(285) 27737-44",2010,"Bin","Liang","B","Institute of Neuroscience and State Key Laboratory of Neuroscience, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200031, China."

This neuropathological hallmark has been attributed to the overexpression of APP but could also be contributed by other HSA21 genes. BACE2 maps to HSA21 and is homologous to BACE1, a β-secretase involved in the amyloidogenic pathway of APP proteolysis, and thus it has been hypothesized that the co-overexpression of both genes could contribute to Alzheimer's like neuropathology present in Down syndrome. The aim of the present study has been to analyse the impact of the co-overexpression of BACE2 and APP, using a double transgenic mouse model. Double transgenic mice did not present any neurological or sensorimotor alterations, nor genotype-dependent anxiety-like behaviour or age-associated cognitive dysfunction. Interestingly, TgBACE2-APP mice showed deregulation of BACE2 expression levels that were significantly increased with respect to single TgBACE2 mice. Co-overexpression of BACE2 and APP did not increase amyloid-β peptide concentration in brain.

Salidroside had no effect on the level of APP, ADAM10 and ADAM17. ELISA analysis revealed that salidroside was able to inhibit the increase of beta-secretase activity and Abeta generation induced by hypoxia, with no effect on gamma-secretase activity. Notably, under hypoxia condition, mRNA of BACE1 and protein level of HIF-1alpha were decreased by salidroside pretreatment.

Recent studies show that Gal may affect amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism and increase release of secretory APPα (sAPPα). However the effect of Gal on amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) release and β-site cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) expression is still unknown. Consequently, we investigated the effect of Gal on the level of Aβ and BACE1. In a differentiated human neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y), Gal (0.3 μM) was found to significantly decrease Aβ release and BACE1 expression following treatment for 6, 12, and 24h. Increasing Gal to 0.9 μM or 10 μM had no further effect. The effect of Gal (0.3 μM for 18h) was maximal on BACE1 expression but not on Aβ secretion. At higher concentration (0.9 μM and 10 μM), Gal had no effect on the level of full-length APP but could still stimulate further decrease in Aβ secretion and release of sAPPα. These observations suggested that 0.3 μM Gal exerts its effect on Aβ production by inhibiting BACE1 expression, while 0.9 μM or 10 μM Gal mainly reduces Aβ production by stimulating the non-amyloidogenic pathway to decrease the amount of APP substrate available for β-secretase cleavage.

Starvation can increase the secretion of Abeta(42) by altering the expression of beta-secretases (BACE1) and gamma-secretases (APH and PEN2). This process is regulated by macroautophagy. Suppression of macroautophagy induction by 3MA further increased the level of Abeta(42) produced under starvation in HUVECs. These results suggest that starvation-induced Abeta(42) secretion might contribute to the formation of CAA and hence vascular degeneration in AD.","1873-3468","FEBS letters","(584) 3101-6",2010,"Jian-Fang","Ma","JF","Department of Neurology & Institute of Neurology, Rui Jin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, PR China."
20638753,"AGEs/RAGE complex upregulates BACE1 via NF-κB pathway activation.","Although the pathogenesis of sporadic Alzheimer disease (AD) is not clearly understood, it is likely dependent on several age-related factors. Diabetes is a risk factor for AD, and multiple mechanisms connecting the 2 diseases have been proposed. Hyperglycemia enhances the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) that result from the auto-oxidation of glucose and fructose. The interaction of AGEs with their receptor, named RAGE, elicits the formation of reactive oxygen species that are also believed to be an early event in AD pathology. To investigate a functional link between the disorders diabetes and AD, the effect of 2 AGEs, pentosidine and glyceraldehydes-derived pyridinium (GLAP), was studied on BACE1 expression both in vivo, in streptozotocin treated rats, and in vitro in differentiated neuroblastoma cells. We showed that pentosidine and GLAP were able to upregulate BACE1 expression through their binding with RAGE and the consequent activation of NF-κB. In addition, both pentosidine and GLAP were found to be increased in the brain in sporadic AD patients. Our findings demonstrate that activation of the AGEs/RAGE axis, by upregulating the key enzyme for amyloid-β production, provides a pathologic link between diabetes mellitus and AD.","1558-1497","Neurobiology of aging","(33) 196.e13-27",2012,"Michela","Guglielmotto","M","Department of Experimental Medicine and Oncology, University of Turin, Turin, Italy."

Genetic studies have further confirmed that BACE1 is essential for processing amyloid precursor protein (APP) at the beta-secretase site. Only after this cleavage can the membrane-bound APP C-terminal fragment be subsequently cleaved by gamma-secretase to release so-called AD-causing Abeta peptides. Hence, in the past decade, a wide variety of BACE1 inhibitors have been developed for AD therapy. This review will summarize the major historical events during the evolution of BACE1 inhibitors designed through different strategies of drug discovery. Although BACE1 inhibitors are expected to be safe in general, careful titration of drug dosage to avoid undesirable side effects in BACE1-directed AD therapy is also emphasized.","1936-2625","International journal of clinical and experimental pathology","(3) 618-28",2010,"Xiaoyang","Luo","X","Department of Neurosciences, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA."
20685197,"The role of low-density receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) as a competitive substrate of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) for BACE1.","Cleavage of APP by BACE1 is the first proteolytic step in the production of amyloid-beta (Abeta), which accumulates in senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease. Through its interaction with APP, the low-density receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) enhances APP internalization. Recently, BACE1 has been shown to interact with and cleave the light chain (lc) of LRP1. Since LRP1 is known to compete with APP for cleavage by gamma-secretase, we tested the hypothesis that LRP1 also acts as a competitive substrate for beta-secretase. We found that the increase in secreted APP (sAPP) mediated by over-expression of BACE1 in APP-transfected cells could be decreased by simultaneous LRP1 over-expression. Analysis by multi-spot ELISA revealed that this is due to a decrease in sAPPbeta, but not sAPPalpha. Interaction between APP and BACE1, as measured by immunoprecipitation and fluorescence lifetime assays, was impaired by LRP1 over-expression. We also demonstrate that APP over-expression leads to decreased LRP1 association with and cleavage by BACE1. In conclusion, our data suggest that--in addition to its role in APP trafficking--LRP1 affects APP processing by competing for cleavage by BACE1.","1090-2430","Experimental neurology","(225) 85-93",2010,"Bjoern","von Einem","B","Dept. of Neurology, Ulm University, Albert Einstein Allee 11, 89081 Ulm, Germany. christine.arnim@uni-ulm.de"
20690163,"Quercetin activates AMP-activated protein kinase by reducing PP2C expression protecting old mouse brain against high cholesterol-induced neurotoxicity.","It is known that a high-cholesterol diet induces oxidative stress, inflammatory response, and beta-amyloid (Abeta) accumulation in mouse brain, resulting in neurodegenerative changes. Quercetin, a naturally occurring flavonoid, has been reported to possess numerous biological activities beneficial to health. Our previous studies have demonstrated that quercetin protects mouse brain against D-galactose-induced oxidative damage. Against this background, we evaluated the effect of quercetin on high-cholesterol-induced neurotoxicity in old mice and explored its potential mechanism. Our results showed that oral administration of quercetin significantly improved the behavioural performance of high-cholesterol-fed old mice in both a step-through test and the Morris water maze task. This is at least in part caused by decreasing ROS and protein carbonyl levels and restoring Cu--Zn superoxide dismutase (Cu, Zn-SOD) activity. Furthermore, quercetin also significantly activated the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) via down-regulation of protein phosphatase 2C (PP2C), which reduced the integral optical density (IOD) of activated microglia cells and CD11b expression, down-regulated iNOS and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression, and decreased IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha expression in the brains of high-cholesterol-fed old mice through the suppression of NF-kappaB p65 nuclear translocation. Moreover, AMPK activation significantly increased 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) phosphorylation and reduced fatty acid synthase (FAS) expression in the brains of high-cholesterol-fed old mice, which reduced cholesterol levels, down-regulated cholesterol 24-hydroxylase (CYP46A1) and beta-amyloid converting enzyme 1 (BACE1) expression, decreased eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2alpha (eIF2alpha) phosphorylation, and lowered Abeta deposits. However, the neuroprotective effect of quercetin was weakened by intraperitoneal injection of compound C, an AMPK inhibitor. These results suggest that AMPK activated by quercetin may be a potential target to enhance the resistance of neurons to age-related diseases.","1096-9896","The Journal of pathology","(222) 199-212",2010,"Jun","Lu","J","Key Laboratory for Biotechnology on Medicinal Plants of Jiangsu Province, School of Life Science, Xuzhou Normal University, Xuzhou 221116, Jiangsu Province, P R China."

Here, we show that infection by a broad range of papillomavirus types requires the intramembrane protease γ secretase. The γ-secretase inhibitor (S,S)-2-[2-(3,5-difluorophenyl)-acetylamino]-N-(1-methyl-2-oxo-5-phenyl-2,3-dihydro-1H-benzo[e][1,4]diazepin-3-yl)-propionamide (compound XXI) inhibits infection in vitro by all types of papillomavirus pseudovirions tested, with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of 130 to 1,000 pM, regardless of reporter construct and without impacting cellular viability. Conversely, XXI does not inhibit in vitro infection by adenovirus or pseudovirions derived from the BK or Merkel cell polyomaviruses. Vaginal application of XXI prevents infection of the mouse genital tract by human papillomavirus type 16 (HPV16) pseudovirions. Nicastrin and presenilin-1 are essential components of the γ-secretase complex, and mouse embryo fibroblasts deficient in any one of these components were not infected by HPV16, whereas wild-type and β-secretase (BACE1)-deficient cells were susceptible. Neither the uptake of HPV16 into Lamp-1-positive perinuclear vesicles nor the disassembly of capsid to reveal both internal L1 and L2 epitopes and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-labeled encapsidated DNA is dependent upon γ-secretase activity. However, blockade of γ-secretase activity by XXI prevents the BrdU-labeled DNA encapsidated by HPV16 from reaching the ND10 subnuclear domains. Since prior studies indicate that L2 is critical for endosomal escape and targeting of the viral DNA to ND10 and that γ secretase is located in endosomal membranes, our findings suggest that either L2 or an intracellular receptor are cleaved by γ secretase as papillomavirus escapes the endosome.","1098-5514","Journal of virology","(84) 10661-70",2010,"Balasubramanyam","Karanam","B","Department of Pathology, Johns Hopkins University, Room 308, Cancer Research Building 2, 1550 Orleans St., Baltimore, MD 21231, USA."

In this study, the effects of expression of human ABCA2 on endogenous amyloid precursor protein (APP) expression, trafficking and processing were examined in mouse N2a neuronal cells. ABCA2 expression increased the steady-state APP mRNA levels through transcription. ABCA2 also induced increased synthesis of APP holoprotein and altered APP processing and metabolite generation. ABCA2 expression promoted b-secretase (BACE1) cleavage of APP not at the common Asp1 amino acid site (β-site) of Aβ in APP but at the Glu11 site (β'-site) to increase C89 carboxyl-terminal fragment levels (β'-CTF/C89). The levels of N-terminally truncated Aβ11-40 peptides were also increased by ABCA2 expression. The delivery of newly synthesized APP to the cell surface through the secretary pathway was not perturbed by ABCA2 expression; however, ABCA2 expression increased the amount of APP in early-endosomal compartments, which also contained the highest levels of β'-CTF/C89 and is likely the site of increased BACE1 processing of APP. This report identifies ABCA2 as a key regulator of endogenous APP expression and processing and suggests a possible biochemical mechanism linking ABCA2 expression, APP processing and Alzheimer's disease.","1875-5828","Current Alzheimer research","(7) 566-77",2010,"W","Davis","W","Department of Biological Sciences/Pharmacology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC 29403, USA. davisw@musc.edu"

To explore potential pathogenic links among some of these lesions, we examined β-secretase-1 (BACE1) alterations relative to Aβ deposition, neuritic pathology and vascular organization in aged monkey and AD human cerebral cortex. Western blot analyses detected increased levels of BACE1 protein and β-site-cleavage amyloid precursor protein C-terminal fragments in plaque-bearing human and monkey cortex relative to controls. In immunohistochemistry, locally elevated BACE1 immunoreactivity (IR) occurred in AD but not in control human cortex, with a trend for increased overall density among cases with greater plaque pathology. In double-labeling preparations, BACE1 IR colocalized with immunolabeling for Aβ but not for phosphorylated tau. In perfusion-fixed monkey cortex, locally increased BACE1 IR co-existed with intra-axonal and extracellular Aβ IR among virtually all neuritic plaques, ranging from primitive to typical cored forms. This BACE1 labeling localized to swollen/sprouting axon terminals that might co-express one or another neuronal phenotype markers (GABAergic, glutamatergic, cholinergic, or catecholaminergic). Importantly, these BACE1-labeled dystrophic axons resided near to or in direct contact with blood vessels. These findings suggest that plaque formation in AD or normal aged primates relates to a multisystem axonal pathogenesis that occurs in partnership with a potential vascular or metabolic deficit. The data provide a mechanistic explanation for why senile plaques are present preferentially near the cerebral vasculature.","1460-9568","The European journal of neuroscience","(32) 1223-38",2010,"Yan","Cai","Y","Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology, Central South University Xiangya Medical School, Changsha, Hunan, China."

Aβ(42) isoform is more easily aggregate and more toxic to neurons than any other Aβ isoforms, thus being regarded as the primary toxic specie in AD. Curcumin mix has potent anti-amyloidogenic effect and shows great promise for AD treatment and prevention. The present study was conducted to examine the effects of curcumin mix and its different curcuminoids including curcumin (Cur), demethoxycurcumin (DMC) and bisdemethoxycurcumin (BDMC) on Aβ(42), APP and BACE1. We found that Cur was the most active curcuminoid fraction in suppressing Aβ(42) production and the order of inhibitory potency of other curcuminoids was DMC>curcumin mix>BDMC. Cur, but not other curcuminoids, could reduce APP protein expression and none of curcuminoids affected APP mRNA level. BDMC could reduce BACE1 mRNA and protein levels, while DMC only affected BACE1 mRNA expression. Our data indicate that the anti-amyloidogenic effect of Cur may be mediated through the modulation of APP, while the anti-amyloidogenic effect of BDMC may be mediated through the modulation of BACE1.","1872-7972","Neuroscience letters","(485) 83-8",2010,"Hongying","Liu","H","Department of Neurology, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou 510080, People's Republic of China."

Abeta is a fragment of a much larger precursor protein, the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Sequential proteolytic cleavage of APP by beta-secretase and gamma-secretase liberates Abeta from APP. The aspartyl protease BACE1 (beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1) catalyses the rate-limiting step in the production of Abeta, and as such it is considered to be a major target for drug development in Alzheimer's disease. However, the development of a BACE1 inhibitor therapy is problematic for two reasons. First, BACE1 has been found to have important physiological roles. Therefore, inhibition of the enzyme could have toxic consequences. Second, the active site of BACE1 is relatively large, and many of the bulky compounds that are needed to inhibit BACE1 activity are unlikely to cross the blood-brain barrier.

MO-QSPR was implemented using Derringer and Suich desirability algorithm to identify the optimal level of independent variables (X) that could confer a trade-off between selectivity and activity. The results obtained from FB-QSAR were further substantiated using MIF (Molecular Interaction Fields) studies.

Along with the development of BACE1 inhibitors, and the generation of its knock-out mice, accumulating data raise concerns regarding a total inhibition of the enzyme as it shares the processing of other substrates. We described a novel approach to interfere with the specific interaction between AβPP and BACE1 using monoclonal antibodies directed to the β-secretase cleavage site upon the substrate, AβPP. Such antibodies limit AβPP cleavage in a cellular model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and avoid the total inhibition of BACE1. Here, we demonstrate the ability of AβPP β-site antibodies to interfere with Aβ production in vivo. Systemic antibody treatment diminished Aβ plaques, membrane-associated oligomers, and intracellular Aβ accumulation, all of which have been implicated in cellular death and synaptic loss, suggesting that this approach may be an applicable strategy for AD treatment.","1875-8908","Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD","(22) 469-82",2010,"Michal","Arbel-Ornath","M","Department of Molecular Microbiology & Biotechnology, George S.

In a study of 12 animals, we treated dogs with 80 mg/day of atorvastatin for 14.5 months. We did not observe improvements in discrimination learning; however, there were transient impairments in reversal learning, suggesting frontal dysfunction. Spatial memory function did not change with treatment. Peripheral levels of cholesterol, LDLs, triglycerides, and HDL were significantly reduced in treated dogs. Aβ in cerebrospinal fluid and brain remained unaffected. However, β-secretase-1 (BACE1) protein levels and activity decreased and correlated with reduced brain cholesterol. Finally, lipidomic analysis revealed a significant decrease in the ratio of omega-6 to omega-3 essential fatty in temporal cortex of treated aged dogs. Aged beagles are a unique model that may provide novel insights and translational data that can predict outcomes of statin use in human clinical trials.

Because the excess level of β-amyloid in the brain is a leading factor in Alzheimer's disease (AD), memapsin 2 is a major therapeutic target for inhibitor drugs. The substrate-binding cleft of memapsin 2 accommodates 12 subsite residues, from P(8) to P(4)'. We have determined the hydrolytic preference as relative k(cat)/K(M) (preference constant) in all 12 subsites and used these data to establish a predictive algorithm for substrate hydrolytic efficiency. Using the sequences from 12 reported memapsin 2 protein substrates, the predicted and experimentally determined preference constants have an excellent correlation coefficient of 0.97. The predictive model indicates that the hydrolytic preference of memapsin 2 is determined mainly by the interaction with six subsites (from P(4) to P(2)'), a conclusion supported by the crystal structure B-factors calculated for the various residues of transition-state analogs bound to different memapsin 2 subsites. The algorithm also predicted that the replacement of the P(3), P(2), and P(1) subsites of APP from Val, Lys, and Met, respectively, to Ile, Asp, and Phe, respectively, (APP(IDF)) would result in a highest hydrolytic rate for β-amyloid-generating APP variants. Because more β-amyloid was produced from cells expressing APP(IDF) than those expressing APP with Swedish mutations, this designed APP variant may be useful in new memapsin 2 substrates or transgenic mice for AD studies.","1469-896X","Protein science : a publication of the Protein Society","(19) 2175-85",2010,"Xiaoman","Li","X","Protein Studies Program, Oklahoma Medical Research Foundation, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma 73104, USA."

The ubiquitin-proteasome system, a major intracellular protein quality control system, has been implicated recently in BACE1 metabolism. We report that the SCF(Fbx2) -E3 ligase is involved in the binding and ubiquitination of BACE1 via its Trp 280 residue of F-box-associated domain. Physiologically, we found that Fbx2 was expressed in various intracellular organelles in brain neurons and that BACE1 is colocalized with Fbx2 and the amyloid precursor protein (APP), mainly at the early endosome and endoplasmic reticulum. The former are believed to be the major intracellular compartments where the APP is cleaved by BACE1 and β-amyloid is produced. Importantly, we found that overexpression of Fbx2 in the primary cortical and hippocampal neurons derived from Tg2576 transgenic mice significantly promoted BACE1 degradation and reduced β-amyloid production. In the search for specific endogenous modulators of Fbx2 expression, we found that PPARγ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α) was capable of promoting the degradation of BACE1 through a mechanism involving Fbx2 gene expression. Interestingly, we found that the expression of both Fbx2 and PGC-1α was significantly decreased in the brains of aging Tg2576 mice. Our in vivo studies using a mouse model of AD revealed that exogenous adenoviral Fbx2 expression in the brain significantly decreased BACE1 protein levels and activity, coincidentally reducing β-amyloid levels and rescuing synaptic deficits.

Notably, increasing evidence indicates that BACE1 levels become elevated in AD brains as disease progresses; however, it remains unclear how the BACE1 upregulation may affect efficacies of therapeutic interventions including BACE1-inhibiting approaches. Here, we crossed heterozygous BACE1 knockout mice with AD transgenic mice (5XFAD model) and compared the abilities of partial BACE1 reduction to rescue AD-like phenotypes at earlier (6-month-old) and advanced (15-18-month-old) stages of disease, which expressed normal (∼100%) and elevated (∼200%) levels of BACE1, respectively. BACE1(+/-) deletion rescued memory deficits as tested by the spontaneous alternation Y-maze task in 5XFAD mice at the earlier stage and prevented their septohippocampal cholinergic deficits associated with significant neuronal loss. Importantly, BACE1(+/-) deletion was no longer able to rescue memory deficits or cholinergic neurodegeneration in 5XFAD mice at the advanced stage. Moreover, BACE1(+/-) deletion significantly reduced levels of Aβ42 and the β-secretase-cleaved C-terminal fragment (C99) in 6-month-old 5XFAD mouse brains, while these neurotoxic β-cleavage products dramatically elevated with age and were not affected by BACE1(+/-) deletion in 15-18-month-old 5XFAD brains. Interestingly, although BACE1(+/-) deletion lowered BACE1 expression by ∼50% in 5XFAD mice irrespective of age in concordance with the reduction in gene copy number, BACE1 equivalent to wild-type controls remained in BACE1(+/-)·5XFAD mice at the advanced age. In accord, phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2α, an important mediator of BACE1 elevation, was dramatically increased (∼9-fold) in 15-18-month-old 5XFAD mice and remained highly upregulated (∼6-fold) in age-matched BACE1(+/-)·5XFAD mice. Together, our results indicate that partial reduction of BACE1 is not sufficient to block the phospho-eIF2α-dependent BACE1 elevation during the progression of AD, thus limiting its abilities to reduce cerebral Aβ/C99 levels and rescue memory deficits and cholinergic neurodegeneration.","1932-6203","PloS one","(5) e12974",2010,"Latha","Devi","L","Center for Dementia Research, Nathan Kline Institute, New York University School of Medicine, Orangeburg, New York, United States of America."

Experimental evidence suggests that muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (CHRM) regulate BACE1 expression. Having recently shown that CHRM1 levels are decreased selectively in frontal cortex regions of a subpopulation of schizophrenic patients (muscarinic receptor deficit schizophrenia, MRDS) we aimed to compare the protein expression of BACE1 and NRG1 in the agranular frontal cortex Brodmann's area 6 of SCZ subjects with normal levels of CHRM1 (N = 19), MRDS (N = 20), and age/gender-matched non-psychiatric (healthy) controls (HC; N = 20). Western blot analysis of post-mortem samples showed that the levels of BACE1 and full-length NRG1 precursor (130 kDa) did not differ significantly between the three groups. In contrast, the levels of the NRG1 C-terminal fragment (NRG1-CTF) were decreased by approximately 50% in both schizophrenic groups compared to the HC group (p<0.0027).

There was no correlation between the levels of either full-length NRG1, NRG1-CTF, or BACE1 and the final recorded doses of antipsychotic drugs for the subjects with schizophrenia. A positive correlation was found between BACE1 and full-length NRG1 precursor in the HC group (r(2) = 0.671, p<0.001) but not in the schizophrenic groups.

BACE1 mRNA levels were measured using quantitative realtime PCR (qPCR) and analyzed by qbasePLUS using validated stably-expressed reference genes. Expression of glial and neuronal markers (glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and neuron-specific enolase (NSE), respectively) were also analyzed to quantify the changing activities of these cell populations in the tissue. BACE1 mRNA levels were significantly elevated in medial temporal and superior parietal gyri, compared to the PD/DLB and/or control groups. Superior frontal gryus BACE1 mRNA levels were significantly increased in the PD/DLB group, compared to AD and control groups. For the AD group, BACE1 mRNA changes were analyzed in the context of the reduced NSE mRNA, and strongly increased GFAP mRNA levels apparent as AD progressed (indicated by Braak stage). This analysis suggested that increased BACE1 mRNA expression in remaining neuronal cells may contribute to the increased BACE1 protein levels and activity found in brain regions affected by AD.","1875-8908","Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD","(22) 1111-22",2010,"David T R","Coulson","DT","Queen's University Belfast, School of Medicine, Dentistry and Biomedical Sciences, Northern Ireland."

The objectives of the present study were to characterize the localization of BACE proteins in human pancreas and determine their function. High levels of BACE enzymatic activity were detected in human pancreas. In normal human pancreas, BACE1 was observed in endocrine as well as in exocrine pancreas, whereas BACE2 expression was restricted to β-cells. Intracellular analysis using immunofluorescence showed colocalization of BACE1 with insulin and BACE2 with clathrin-coated vesicles of the plasma membrane in MIN6 cells. When BACE1 and -2 were pharmacologically inhibited, BACE1 localization was not altered, whereas BACE2 content in clathrin-coated vesicles was increased. Insulin internalization rate was reduced, insulin receptor β-subunit (IRβ) expression was decreased at the plasma membrane and increased in the Golgi apparatus, and a significant reduction in insulin gene expression was detected. Similar results were obtained after specific BACE2 silencing in MIN6 cells. All these data point to a role for BACE2 in the IRβ trafficking and insulin signaling.

We report here that in mice, the potent PKC activator bryostatin1 protects against mTBI induced learning and memory deficits and reduction in pre-synaptic synaptophysin and post-synaptic spinophylin immunostaining. An effective treatment has to start within the first 8h after injury, and includes 5 × i.p. injections over a period of 14 days. The treatment is dose dependent. Exploring the effects of the repeated bryostatin1 treatment on the processing of the amyloid precursor protein, we found that the treatment induced an increase in the putative α-secretase ADAM10 and a reduction in β-secretase activities. Both these effects could contribute towards a reduction in β-amyloid production. These results suggest that bryostatin1 protects against mTBI cognitive and synaptic sequela by rescuing synapses, which is possibly mediated by an increase in ADAM10 and a decrease in BACE1 activity.

21073551,"β-Secretase activity in rat astrocytes: translational block of BACE1 and modulation of BACE2 expression.","BACE1 and BACE2 are two closely related membrane-bound aspartic proteases. BACE1 is widely recognized as the neuronal β-secretase that cleaves the amyloid-β precursor protein, thus allowing the production of amyloid-β, i.e. the peptide that has been proposed to trigger the neurodegenerative process in Alzheimer's disease. BACE2 has ubiquitous expression and its physiological and pathological role is still unclear. In light of a possible role of glial cells in the accumulation of amyloid-β in brain, we have investigated the expression of these two enzymes in primary cultures of astrocytes. We show that astrocytes possess β-secretase activity and produce amyloid-β because of the activity of BACE2, but not BACE1, the expression of which is blocked at the translational level. Finally, our data demonstrate that changes in the astrocytic phenotype during neuroinflammation can produce both a negative as well as a positive modulation of β-secretase activity, also depending on the differential responsivity of the brain regions.","1460-9568","The European journal of neuroscience","(33) 236-43",2011,"Barbara","Bettegazzi","B","San Raffaele Scientific Institute, via Olgettina 58, I-20132, Milano, Italy Vita-Salute San Raffaele University, Milano, Italy Italian Institute of Technology, Research Unit of Molecular Neuroscience, Milano, Italy."

Based upon structure-activity relationships, 3,4'-dihydroxy flavonols with a prenyl or lavandulyl group substitution at the C-8 position, and a hydroxy group at the C-5, are important for such inhibition. In our ongoing study to isolate active principles from S. flavescens by an activity-guided isolation procedure, further detailed phytochemical investigations of the CH(2)Cl(2) fraction were conducted via repeated chromatography over silica gel and Sephadex LH-20 columns. This ultimately resulted in the isolation of a promising active sophoflavescenol with higher inhibitory activities among the current prenylated flavonols isolated from S. flavescens against RLAR, HRAR, AGE, BACE1 and ChEs. The results further support that 3,4'-dihydroxy flavonols with a prenyl or lavandulyl substitution at the C-8 position and a methoxy group at C-5 represent a new class of RLAR, HRAR and AGE inhibitors. Nevertheless, the C-5 hydroxyl group of prenylated flavonoids is important for inhibition of BACE1 and ChEs, indicating that the hydroxyl group at C-5 might be the main contributor to the augmentation and/or modification of prenylated flavonol activity.","1099-1573","Phytotherapy research : PTR","(25) 709-15",2011,"Hyun Ah","Jung","HA","Department of Food Science and Human Nutrition, Chonbuk National University, Jeonju, Republic of Korea."

Here, we apply our strategy to the brain. By combining high-density lipoprotein (HDL) as a second carrier with α-tocopherol-conjugated siRNA (Toc-siRNA) in the brain, we achieved dramatic improvement of siRNA delivery to neurons. After direct intracerebroventricular (ICV) infusion of Toc-siRNA/HDL for 7 days, extensive and specific knock-down of a target gene, β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), was observed in both mRNA and protein levels, especially in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. This new delivery method achieved a much more prominent down-regulation effect than conventional silencing methods of the brain gene, i.e., ICV infusion of nonconjugated siRNA or oligonucleotides. With only 3 nmol Toc-siRNA with HDL, BACE1 mRNA in the parietal cortex could be reduced by ∼ 70%. We suppose that this dramatic improvement of siRNA delivery to the brain is due to the use of lipoprotein receptor-mediated endocytosis because the silencing efficiency was significantly increased by binding of Toc-siRNA to the lipoprotein, and in contrast, was clearly decreased in lipoprotein-receptor knockout mice. These results suggest exogenous siRNA could be used clinically for otherwise incurable neurological diseases.","1557-7422","Human gene therapy","(22) 711-9",2011,"Yoshitaka","Uno","Y","Department of Neurology and Neurological Science, Graduate School, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-0034, Japan."

We have previously identified the contribution of elevated BACE1 activity to voltage-gated sodium channel Na(v)1.1 density and neuronal function. Here, we analyzed physiological changes in sodium channel metabolism in BACE1-null mice. Mechanistically, we first confirmed that endogenous BACE1 requires its substrate, the β-subunit Na(v)β(2), to regulate levels of the pore-forming α-subunit Na(v)1.1 in cultured primary neurons. Next, we analyzed sodium channel α-subunit levels in brains of BACE1-null mice at 1 and 3 months of age. At both ages, we found that Na(v)1.1 protein levels were significantly decreased in BACE1-null versus wild-type mouse brains, remaining unchanged in BACE1-heterozygous mouse brains. Interestingly, levels of Na(v)1.2 and Na(v)1.6 α-subunits also decreased in 1-month-old BACE1-null mice. In the hippocampus of BACE1-null mice, we found a robust 57% decrease of Na(v)1.1 levels. Next, we performed surface biotinylation studies in acutely dissociated hippocampal slices from BACE1-null mice. Hippocampal surface Na(v)1.1 levels were significantly decreased, but Na(v)1.2 surface levels were increased in BACE1-null mice perhaps as a compensatory mechanism for reduced surface Na(v)1.1. We also found that Na(v)β(2) processing and Na(v)1.1 mRNA levels were significantly decreased in brains of BACE1-null mice. This suggests a mechanism consistent with BACE1 activity regulating mRNA levels of the α-subunit Na(v)1.1 via cleavage of cell-surface Na(v)β(2). Together, our data show that endogenous BACE1 activity regulates total and surface levels of voltage-gated sodium channels in mouse brains. Both decreased Na(v)1.1 and elevated surface Na(v)1.2 may result in a seizure phenotype. Our data caution that therapeutic BACE1 activity inhibition in Alzheimer disease patients may affect Na(v)1 metabolism and alter neuronal membrane excitability in Alzheimer disease patients.","1083-351X","The Journal of biological chemistry","(286) 8106-8116",2011,"Doo Yeon","Kim","DY","From the Neurobiology of Disease Laboratory, Genetics and Aging Research Unit, Massachusetts General Institute for Neurodegenerative Disease, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Charlestown, Massachusetts 02129 and."

Cognitively normal control subjects (n = 170) and AD patients (n = 92) were genotyped for 19 putative regulatory tagging SNPs within 9 genes (APP, ADAM10, BACE1, BACE2, PSEN1, PSEN2, PEN2, NCSTN and APH1B) involved in the APP processing pathway. SNP genotypes were tested for their association with CSF APPα, APPβ, and Aβ42, AD risk and age-at-onset while taking into account age, gender, race and APOE ε4. After adjusting for multiple comparisons, a significant association was found between ADAM10 SNP rs514049 and APPα levels. In controls, the rs514049 CC genotype had higher APPα levels than the CA, AA collapsed genotype, whereas the opposite effect was seen in AD patients. These results suggest that genetic variation within ADAM10, an APP processing gene, influences CSF APPα levels in an AD specific manner.","1558-1497","Neurobiology of aging","(32) 556.e13-23",2011,"L M","Bekris","LM","Geriatric Research, Education and Clinical Center (GRECC), VA Puget Sound Health Care System, Seattle, WA, USA. lbekris@u.washington.edu"
21203578,"A novel statistical algorithm for gene expression analysis helps differentiate pregnane X receptor-dependent and independent mechanisms of toxicity.","Genome-wide gene expression profiling has become standard for assessing potential liabilities as well as for elucidating mechanisms of toxicity of drug candidates under development. Analysis of microarray data is often challenging due to the lack of a statistical model that is amenable to biological variation in a small number of samples. Here we present a novel non-parametric algorithm that requires minimal assumptions about the data distribution. Our method for determining differential expression consists of two steps: 1) We apply a nominal threshold on fold change and platform p-value to designate whether a gene is differentially expressed in each treated and control sample relative to the averaged control pool, and 2) We compared the number of samples satisfying criteria in step 1 between the treated and control groups to estimate the statistical significance based on a null distribution established by sample permutations. The method captures group effect without being too sensitive to anomalies as it allows tolerance for potential non-responders in the treatment group and outliers in the control group. Performance and results of this method were compared with the Significant Analysis of Microarrays (SAM) method. These two methods were applied to investigate hepatic transcriptional responses of wild-type (PXR(+/+)) and pregnane X receptor-knockout (PXR(-/-)) mice after 96 h exposure to CMP013, an inhibitor of β-secretase (β-site of amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 or BACE1). Our results showed that CMP013 led to transcriptional changes in hallmark PXR-regulated genes and induced a cascade of gene expression changes that explained the hepatomegaly observed only in PXR(+/+) animals. Comparison of concordant expression changes between PXR(+/+) and PXR(-/-) mice also suggested a PXR-independent association between CMP013 and perturbations to cellular stress, lipid metabolism, and biliary transport.","1932-6203","PloS one","(5) e15595",2010,"M Ann","Mongan","MA","Comparative Biology and Safety Sciences, Amgen Inc, Thousand Oaks, California, United States of America. thuyv@amgen.com"
21209097,"Inhibition of beta-secretase in vivo via antibody binding to unique loops (D and F) of BACE1.","β-Secretase (BACE1) is an attractive drug target for Alzheimer disease. However, the design of clinical useful inhibitors targeting its active site has been extremely challenging. To identify alternative drug targeting sites we have generated a panel of BACE1 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that interfere with BACE1 activity in various assays and determined their binding epitopes. mAb 1A11 inhibited BACE1 in vitro using a large APP sequence based substrate (IC(50) ∼0.76 nm), in primary neurons (EC(50) ∼1.8 nm), and in mouse brain after stereotactic injection. Paradoxically, mAb 1A11 increased BACE1 activity in vitro when a short synthetic peptide was used as substrate, indicating that mAb 1A11 does not occupy the active-site. Epitope mapping revealed that mAb 1A11 binds to adjacent loops D and F, which together with nearby helix A, distinguishes BACE1 from other aspartyl proteases. Interestingly, mutagenesis of loop F and helix A decreased or increased BACE1 activity, identifying them as enzymatic regulatory elements and as potential alternative sites for inhibitor design. In contrast, mAb 5G7 was a potent BACE1 inhibitor in cell-free enzymatic assays (IC(50) ∼0.47 nm) but displayed no inhibitory effect in primary neurons. Its epitope, a surface helix 299-312, is inaccessible in membrane-anchored BACE1. Remarkably, mutagenesis of helix 299-312 strongly reduced BACE1 ectodomain shedding, suggesting that this helix plays a role in BACE1 cellular biology. In conclusion, this study generated highly selective and potent BACE1 inhibitory mAbs, which recognize unique structural and functional elements in BACE1, and uncovered interesting alternative sites on BACE1 that could become targets for drug development.","1083-351X","The Journal of biological chemistry","(286) 8677-8687",2011,"Lujia","Zhou","L","From the Department of Molecular and Developmental Genetics, VIB and; the Center for Human Genetics, KULeuven, 3000 Leuven, Belgium."

It has been reported that BACE1 intracellular trafficking, in particular endosome-to-TGN sorting, is mediated by adaptor complexes, such as retromer and Golgi-localized γ-ear-containing ARF-binding proteins (GGAs). Here we investigated whether sortilin, a Vps10p domain-sorting receptor believed to participate in retromer-mediated transport of select membrane cargoes, contributes to the subcellular trafficking and activity of BACE1. Our initial studies revealed increased levels of sortilin in post-mortem brain tissue of AD patients and that overexpression of sortilin leads to increased BACE1-mediated cleavage of APP in cultured cells. In contrast, RNAi suppression of sortilin results in decreased BACE1-mediated cleavage of APP. We also found that sortilin interacts with BACE1 and that a sortilin construct lacking its cytoplasmic domain, which contains putative retromer sorting motifs, remains bound to BACE1. However, expression of this truncated sortilin redistributes BACE1 from the trans-Golgi network to the endosomes and substantially reduces the retrograde trafficking of BACE1. Site-directed mutagenesis and chimera experiments reveal that the cytoplasmic tail of sortilin, but not those from other VPS10p domain receptors (e.g. SorCs1b and SorLA), plays a unique role in BACE1 trafficking. Our studies suggest a new function for sortilin as a modulator of BACE1 retrograde trafficking and subsequent generation of Aβ.","1083-351X","The Journal of biological chemistry","(286) 12602-16",2011,"Gina M","Finan","GM","Graduate Program in Pathobiology and Molecular Medicine, Department of Pathology and cell Biology, Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Columbia University Medical Center, New York, NY 10032, USA."

NPD1 reduces Aβ42 peptide release from aging human brain cells and is severely depleted in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. Here we further characterize the mechanism of NPD1's neurogenic actions using 3xTg-AD mouse models and human neuronal-glial (HNG) cells in primary culture, either challenged with Aβ42 oligomeric peptide, or transfected with beta amyloid precursor protein (βAPP)(sw) (Swedish double mutation APP695(sw), K595N-M596L). We also show that NPD1 downregulates Aβ42-triggered expression of the pro-inflammatory enzyme cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and of B-94 (a TNF-α-inducible pro-inflammatory element) and apoptosis in HNG cells. Moreover, NPD1 suppresses Aβ42 peptide shedding by down-regulating β-secretase-1 (BACE1) while activating the α-secretase ADAM10 and up-regulating sAPPα, thus shifting the cleavage of βAPP holoenzyme from an amyloidogenic into the non-amyloidogenic pathway. Use of the thiazolidinedione peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) agonist rosiglitazone, the irreversible PPARγ antagonist GW9662, and overexpressing PPARγ suggests that the NPD1-mediated down-regulation of BACE1 and Aβ42 peptide release is PPARγ-dependent. In conclusion, NPD1 bioactivity potently down regulates inflammatory signaling, amyloidogenic APP cleavage and apoptosis, underscoring the potential of this lipid mediator to rescue human brain cells in early stages of neurodegenerations.","1932-6203","PloS one","(6) e15816",2011,"Yuhai","Zhao","Y","School of Medicine, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, New Orleans, Louisiana, United States of America."

Notably, the β4-subunit was recently identified as a novel substrate of the β-secretase, BACE1, a key enzyme of the amyloidogenic pathway in Alzheimer's disease. Here, we asked whether BACE1-mediated cleavage of β4-subunit has an impact on I (NaR) and, consequently, on the firing properties of Purkinje cells. In cerebellar tissue of BACE1-/- mice, mRNA levels of Na(+) channel α-subunits 1.1, 1.2, and 1.6 and of β-subunits 1-4 remained unchanged, but processing of β4 peptide was profoundly altered. Patch-clamp recordings from acutely isolated Purkinje cells of BACE1-/- and WT mice did not reveal any differences in steady-state properties and in current densities of transient, persistent, and resurgent Na(+) currents. However, I (NaR) was found to decay significantly faster in BACE1-deficient Purkinje cells than in WT cells. In modeling studies, the altered time course of I (NaR) decay could be replicated when we decreased the efficiency of open-channel block. In current-clamp recordings, BACE1-/- Purkinje cells displayed lower spontaneous firing rate than normal cells. Computer simulations supported the hypothesis that the accelerated decay kinetics of I (NaR) are responsible for the slower firing rate. Our study elucidates a novel function of BACE1 in the regulation of neuronal excitability that serves to tune the firing pattern of Purkinje cells and presumably other neurons endowed with I (NaR).","1432-2013","Pflugers Archiv : European journal of physiology","(461) 355-71",2011,"Tobias","Huth","T","Institute of Physiology and Pathophysiology, University of Erlangen-Nürnberg, Universitätsstr. 17, 91054, Erlangen, Germany.

The neurotrophin receptor p75NTR has been proposed to mediate Aβ-induced neurotoxicity; however, its role in the development of AD remains to be clarified. The p75NTR/ExonIII-/- mice and APPSwe/PS1dE9 mice were crossed to generate transgenic AD mice with deletion of p75NTR gene. In APPSwe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice, p75NTR expression was localized in the basal forebrain neurons and degenerative neurites in neocortex, increased with aging, and further activated by Aβ accumulation. Deletion of the p75NTR gene in APPSwe/PS1dE9 mice reduced soluble Aβ levels in the brain and serum, but increased the accumulation of insoluble Aβ and Aβ plaque formation. There was no change in the levels of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its proteolytic derivatives, or α-, β-, and γ-secretase activities, or in levels of BACE1, neprilysin (NEP), and insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) proteins. Aβ production by cortical neurons of APPSwe/PS1dE9 mice was reduced by deletion of p75NTR gene in vitro. Recombinant extracellular domain of p75NTR attenuated the oligomerization and fibrillation of synthetic Aβ(42) peptide in vitro, and reduced local Aβ plaques after hippocampus injection in vivo. In addition, deletion of p75NTR attenuated microgliosis but increased the microhemorrhage profiles in the brain. The deletion of p75NTR did not significantly change the cognitive function of the mice up to the age of 9 months. Our data suggest that p75NTR plays a critical role in regulating Aβ levels by both increasing Aβ production and attenuating its aggregation, and they caution that a therapeutic intervention simply reducing p75NTR may exacerbate AD pathology.","1529-2401","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","(31) 2292-304",2011,"Yan-Jiang","Wang","YJ","Department of Human Physiology and Centre for Neuroscience, Flinders University, Adelaide 5001, South Australia, Australia. yanjiang_wang@tmmu.edu.cn"

The intake of the polyunsaturated fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) has been associated with decreased amyloid deposition and a reduced risk in Alzheimer disease in several epidemiological trials; however, the exact underlying molecular mechanism remains to be elucidated. Here, we systematically investigate the effect of DHA on amyloidogenic and nonamyloidogenic APP processing and the potential cross-links to cholesterol metabolism in vivo and in vitro. DHA reduces amyloidogenic processing by decreasing β- and γ-secretase activity, whereas the expression and protein levels of BACE1 and presenilin1 remain unchanged. In addition, DHA increases protein stability of α-secretase resulting in increased nonamyloidogenic processing. Besides the known effect of DHA to decrease cholesterol de novo synthesis, we found cholesterol distribution in plasma membrane to be altered. In the presence of DHA, cholesterol shifts from raft to non-raft domains, and this is accompanied by a shift in γ-secretase activity and presenilin1 protein levels. Taken together, DHA directs amyloidogenic processing of APP toward nonamyloidogenic processing, effectively reducing Aβ release. DHA has a typical pleiotropic effect; DHA-mediated Aβ reduction is not the consequence of a single major mechanism but is the result of combined multiple effects.","1083-351X","The Journal of biological chemistry","(286) 14028-39",2011,"Marcus O W","Grimm","MO","Department of Neurodegeneration and Neurobiology, Deutsches Institut für DemenzPrävention, Saarland University, 66421 Homburg, Germany. marcus.grimm@uks.eu"

BACE1 cleaves β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) to generate amyloid β protein (Aβ), a central component of neuritic plaques in AD brains. Nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) signalling plays an important role in gene regulation and is implicated in inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis. In this report we found that both BACE1 and NF-κB p65 levels were significantly increased in the brains of AD patients. Two functional NF-κB-binding elements were identified in the human BACE1 promoter region. We found that NF-κB p65 expression resulted in increased BACE1 promoter activity and BACE1 transcription, while disruption of NF-κB p65 decreased BACE1 gene expression in p65 knockout (RelA-knockout) cells. In addition, NF-κB p65 expression leads to up-regulated β-secretase cleavage and Aβ production, while non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibited BACE1 transcriptional activation induced by strong NF-κB activator tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α). Taken together, our results clearly demonstrate that NF-κB signalling facilitates BACE1 gene expression and APP processing, and increased BACE1 expression mediated by NF-κB signalling in the brain could be one of the novel molecular mechanisms underlying the development of AD in some sporadic cases. Furthermore, NSAIDs could block the inflammation-induced BACE1 transcription and Aβ production.

Furthermore, BACE1 promoter activity is, but PSEN1 not, decreased by nicotine in the cell line. All the results suggest that activation of α4β2 nAChR decreases Aβ through regulating BACE1 transcription by ERK1-NFκB pathway. Additionally, analysis of BACE1 promoter activity by dual-luciferase reporter assay may be useful for drug screening as a high throughput method.","1573-6903","Neurochemical research","(36) 904-12",2011,"Hui-Zhen","Nie","HZ","Laboratory of Neuropharmacology, School of Pharmacy, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 200240 Shanghai, China."
21345314,"Effects of chronic alcohol consumption on expression levels of APP and Aβ-producing enzymes.","Chronic alcohol consumption contributes to numerous diseases, including cancers, cardiovascular diseases, and liver cirrhosis. Epidemiological studies have shown that excessive alcohol consumption is a risk factor for dementia. Along this line, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and is caused by the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ plaques in neurons. In this study, we hypothesized that chronic ethanol consumption is associated with pathological processing of APP in AD. To investigate the relationship between chronic alcohol consumption and Aβ production, brain samples from rats fed an alcohol liquid diet for 5 weeks were analyzed. We show that the expression levels of APP, BACE1, and immature nicastrin were increased in the cerebellum, hippocampus, and striatum of the alcohol-fed group compared to the control group. Total nicastrin and PS1 levels were induced in the hippocampus of alcohol-fed rats. These data suggest that the altered expression of APP and Aβ-producing enzymes possibly contributes to the chronic alcohol consumption-mediated pathogenesis of AD.","1976-670X","BMB reports","(44) 135-9",2011,"Sae-Rom","Kim","SR","School of Pharmacy, Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology, Gwangju 500-712, Korea."

The study aims to investigate the effect of Curcumin on the expression of GSK-3β, β-catenin and CyclinD1 in vitro, which are tightly correlated with Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, and also to explore the mechanisms, which will provide a novel therapeutic intervention for treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Plasmid APPswe and BACE1-mychis were transiently co-transfected into SHSY5Y cells by Liposfectamin™2000. The cells were treated with Curcumin at 0, 1.25, 5.0, 20.0 μmol/L for 24 h, or with Curcumin at 5.0 μmol/L for 0, and 12, 24 and 48 h for time course assay. Cell lysates were collected for RT-PCR, Western blot assay and immunofluorescent staining were carried out for detecting the effect of Curcumin on the expression of GSK-3β, β-catenin and CyclinD1. RT-PCR and Western blot results showed that the expression of GSK-3β mRNA and protein significantly decreased in the transfected cells treated with Curcumin, and that the changes were in a dose and time-dependent manner (P<0.05); however, the protein expression of GSK-3β-Ser9 was increased (P<0.05). Meanwhile, the expressions of β-catenin and transcriptional factors CyclinD1 mRNA and protein increased and the changes were also in a dose and time-dependent manner (P<0.05). Immunofluorescent staining results not only confirmed the above changes, but also showed that β-catenin had translocated into the nucleus gradually with the increased dosage of Curcumin. Therefore, GSK-3β is a potential target for treatment of AD. Curcumin could activate the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway through inhibiting the expression of GSK-3β and inducing the expression of β-catenin and CyclinD1, which will provide a new theory for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases by Curcumin.","1879-0720","European journal of pharmaceutical sciences : official journal of the European Federation for Pharmaceutical Sciences","(42) 540-6",2011,"Xiong","Zhang","X","Institute of Neuroscience, Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing 400016, China."

The enzyme is believed to possess an open and a closed conformation that corresponds to its free and inhibitor-bound form respectively. Here, we study the dynamic transition of BACE1 employing normal mode analysis (NMA) using a simplified elastic network model (ENM). Estimation of the catalytic cavity volume on the structures of BACE1 encoded by the lowest frequency normal mode reveals the dynamical transition of the enzyme from the open to the closed conformer. Detailed analysis reveals that concerted movement of different loop segments in the active site of the protein, namely flap regions, 10s loop, A loop and F loop, squeeze the catalytic cavity between the N-terminal and C-terminal lobe of the substrate binding domain of BACE1. We also propose that the NMA encoded multiple receptor conformations (MRC) of BACE1 elucidate the pharmacophoric feature necessary to inhibit the enzyme by a polyphenol, myricetin. van der Waals interaction is found to be the main driving force that guides the ligand induced conformational switching to the closed conformer. We suggest that NMA derived MRC of BACE1 is an efficient way to treat the receptor flexibility in docking and thus can be further applied in virtual screening and structure based drug design.","1872-9754","Neurochemistry international","(58) 914-23",2011,"Sandipan","Chakraborty","S","Saroj Mohan Institute of Technology, Guptipara, Hooghly, Pin 712512, India."

Here, we aimed to investigate the role of PPARγ coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), which controls major metabolic functions through the co-activation of PPARγ and other transcription factors. Western blotting experiments with nuclear extracts from brain cortex of AD cases and controls showed a reduction in the levels of PGC-1α in AD patients. PGC-1α overexpression in N2a neuroblastoma cells induced a decrease in the levels of secreted Aβ and an increase in the levels of non-amyloidogenic soluble AβPPα. The decrease in Aβ after exogenous expression of PGC-1α was a consequence of reduced BACE1 expression and transcription, together with a decrease in BACE1 promoter activity. In addition, we detected a significant reduction in β-secretase activity by measuring the levels of β-carboxy terminus fragment (β-CTFs) and by using a commercial assay for β-secretase. In contrast, down-regulation of PGC-1α levels by transfection with PGC-1α siRNA increased BACE1 expression. These effects appeared to be dependent on PPARγ, because PGC-1α did not affect Aβ and BACE1 levels in N2a cells transfected with PPARγ siRNA or in PPARγ knockout fibroblasts. In conclusion, since PGC-1α appears to decrease Aβ generation, therapeutic modulation of PGC-1α could have real potential as a treatment for AD.","1875-8908","Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD","(25) 151-62",2011,"Loukia","Katsouri","L","Centre for Neuroscience, Division of Experimental Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK."

According to the Consensus Report of the Working Group on Molecular and Biochemical Markers of Alzheimer's Disease, in order to qualify as a biomarker the sample in question must adhere to certain basic requirements, including the ability to: reflect AD pathology and differentiate it from other dementia with an 80% sensitivity; be reliable and reproducible; be easy to perform and analyze; remain relatively inexpensive. Beta secretases are crucial enzymes in the pathogenesis of AD. Given its primary role in brain amyloidogenesis and its ubiquitous expression, one may consider measuring peripheral BACE1 levels and activity as biomarkers of AD, like performed in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid. However, very little is known about the periphery and whether peripheral BACE1 is involved in AD pathogenesis or mirrors AD progression. Moreover, no investigation has focused on the possibility of monitoring peripheral BACE1 to assess the efficiency of BACE1 inhibitors during the course of clinical trials. Part of the problem may be attributed to the lack of sensitive molecular tools which are absolutely necessary to use BACE1 as a biomarker. In this review we evaluate the progress and feasibility of developing BACE1 as a biomarker for AD in different tissues.","1875-8908","Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD","(24 Suppl 2) 53-9",2011,"Boris","Decourt","B","Banner Sun Health Research Institute, Haldeman Laboratory of Molecular Diagnostics and Therapeutics, Sun City, AZ 85351, USA.

Intravenously injected RVG-targeted exosomes delivered GAPDH siRNA specifically to neurons, microglia, oligodendrocytes in the brain, resulting in a specific gene knockdown. Pre-exposure to RVG exosomes did not attenuate knockdown, and non-specific uptake in other tissues was not observed.

NPD1 stereoselectively and specifically binds to human retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells and neutrophils. In turn, this lipid mediator induces dephosphorylation of Bcl-x(L) in a PP2A-dependent manner and induces PI3K/Akt and mTOR/p70S6K pathways leading to RPE cell survival during oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. As a proof of principle of its systemic in vivo bioactivity, NPD1 attenuates laser-induced choroidal neovascularization in mice. Using human neural cells transfected with amyloid precursor protein (APP)sw (Swedish double mutation APP695sw, K595N, M596L), NPD1 was shown to regulate secretase-mediated production of Aβ peptide, downregulates pro-inflammatory gene expression, and promotes cell survival. In human neural cells overexpressing beta-amyloid precursor protein (βAPP), the lipid mediator suppressed Aβ42 shedding by downregulating β-secretase (BACE1) while activating the α-secretase (ADAM10), thus shifting the βAPP cleavage from the noxious amyloidogenic pathway into a non-amyloidogenic, neurotrophic pathway. Furthermore, downregulation of Aβ42 peptide release by NPD1 may be dependent upon PPARγ activation. In conclusion, NPD1 exhibits anti-inflammatory, anti-amyloidogenic, and anti-apoptotic bioactivities in human neural cells in part via PPARγ signaling and through the targeting of α- and β-secretase systems.","1559-1182","Molecular neurobiology","(43) 131-8",2011,"David T","Stark","DT","Neuroscience Center of Excellence, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center, 2020 Gravier Street, Suite D, New Orleans, LA 70112, USA."

Several reports demonstrate increased BACE1 enzymatic activity in brain and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from Alzheimer's disease (AD) subjects, suggesting that an increase in BACE1-mediated cleavage of APP drives amyloid pathophysiology in AD. BACE1 cleavage of APP leads to the generation of a secreted N-terminal fragment of APP (sAPPβ). To relate BACE1 activity better to endogenous APP processing in AD and control brains, we have directly measured brain sAPPβ levels using a novel APP β-site specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. We demonstrate a significant reduction in brain cortical sAPPβ levels in AD compared with control subjects. In the same brain samples, BACE1 activity was unchanged, full-length APP and sAPPα levels were significantly reduced, and Aβ peptides were significantly elevated. In conclusion, a reduction in cortical brain sAPPβ together with unchanged BACE1 activity suggests that this is due to reduced full-length APP substrate in late-stage AD subjects. These results highlight the need for multiparameter analysis of the amyloidogenic process to understand better AD pathophysiology in early vs. late-stage AD.","1097-4547","Journal of neuroscience research","(89) 822-32",2011,"Guoxin","Wu","G","Department of Neurology, Merck Research Laboratory, West Point, Pennsylvania. guoxin_wu@merck.com"

In the present study, we examined the effect of 5-LO pharmacological inhibition on the amyloidotic phenotype of these mice. Aβ deposition in the brains of mice receiving zileuton, a selective and specific 5-LO inhibitor, was significantly reduced when compared with control Tg2576 mice receiving vehicle. This reduction was associated with a similar decrease in brain Aβ peptides levels. Zileuton treatment did not induce any change in the steady state levels of amyloid-β precursor protein (APP), BACE1 or ADAM10. By contrast, it resulted in a significant reduction of presenilin 1 (PSEN1, alias PS1), nicastrin (NCSTN) , presenilin enhancer 2 homolog (PSNEN, alias, Pen-2), and anterior pharynx defective 1 (APH-1), the four components of the γ-secretase complex-at the protein and message level. Furthermore, in vitro studies confirmed that zileuton prevents Aβ formation by modulating γ-secretase complex levels without affecting Notch signaling. These data establish a functional role for 5-LO in the pathogenesis of AD-like amyloidosis, whereby it modulates the γ-secretase pathway.

An increase in CSF-BACE1 activity was associated with decreased left and right hippocampus volume corrected for global head volume in the AD patients. Boot-strapped regression analysis showed that increased CSF levels of BACE1 activity were associated with increased CSF concentration of total tau but not amyloid-β1-42 in AD.

BACE1 has been an attractive target for drug development. In cultured embryonic neurons, BACE1-cleaved N-terminal APP is further processed to generate a fragment that can trigger axonal degeneration, suggesting a vital role for BACE1 in axonal health. In addition, BACE1 cleaves neuregulin 1 type III, a protein critical for myelination of peripheral axons by Schwann cells during development. Here, we asked whether axonal degeneration or axonal regeneration in adult nerves might be affected by inhibition or elimination of BACE1. We report that BACE1 knock-out and wild-type nerves degenerated at a similar rate after axotomy and to a similar extent in the experimental neuropathies produced by administration of paclitaxel and acrylamide. These data indicate N-APP is not the sole culprit in axonal degeneration in adult nerves. Unexpectedly, however, we observed that BACE1 knock-out mice had markedly enhanced clearance of axonal and myelin debris from degenerated fibers, accelerated axonal regeneration, and earlier reinnervation of neuromuscular junctions, compared with littermate controls. These observations were reproduced in part by pharmacological inhibition of BACE1.

We describe here the identification of a novel APP mutation E682K located at this β'-site in an early onset Alzheimer's disease (AD) case. Functional analysis revealed that this E682K mutation blocked the β'-site and shifted cleavage of APP to the β-site, causing increased Aβ production. This work demonstrates the functional importance of APP processing at the β'-site and shows how disruption of the balance between β- and β'-site cleavage may enhance the amyloidogenic processing and consequentially risk for AD. Increasing exon- and exome-based sequencing efforts will identify many more putative pathogenic mutations without conclusive segregation-based evidence in a single family. Our study shows how functional analysis of such mutations allows to determine the potential pathogenic nature of these mutations.

All key structural parameters such as position of the flap, volume of the active site, electrostatic binding energy, structures, and positions of the inserts A, D, and F and 10s loop obtained from the MD simulations show that, in comparison to the WT-substrate, BACE1 exhibits greater affinity for the SW-substrate and orients it in a more reactive conformation. The enzyme-substrate models derived from the MD simulations were further utilized to investigate the general acid/base mechanism used by BACE1 to hydrolytically cleave these substrates. This mechanism proceeds through the following two steps: (1) formation of the gem-diol intermediate and (2) cleavage of the peptide bond. For the WT-substrate, the overall barrier of 22.4 kcal/mol for formation of the gem-diol intermediate is 3.3 kcal/mol higher than for the SW-substrate (19.1 kcal/mol). This process is found to be the rate-limiting in the entire mechanism. The computed barrier is in agreement with the measured barrier of ca. 18.00 kcal/mol for the WT-substrate and supports the experimental observation that the cleavage of the SW-substrate is 60 times more efficient than the WT-substrate.","1520-4995","Biochemistry","(50) 4337-49",2011,"Arghya","Barman","A","Department of Chemistry, University of Miami, 1301 Memorial Drive, Coral Gables, FL 33146, USA."

An optimal brain insulin level promotes Aβ clearance, which may play protective roles against Alzheimer's disease. In this study we examined the role of dietary conditions leading to insulin resistance on amyloidosis in fructose-drinking rats. Further investigations tested pioglitazone, an insulin sensitizer, intervention on the altered amyloidosis in this rodent model of insulin resistance. Six-week-old male Wistar rats were fed a standard commercial diet and water without (control) or with 10% fructose for 16 weeks. The animals were randomly divided into 4 groups (n=10): non-treated and water-drinking rats (control group); pioglitazone treated and water-drinking (control treatment group); non-treated and fructose-drinking rats (fructose group) and pioglitazone-treated and fructose-drinking rats (fructose treatment group). Pioglitazone was given at the dose of 10mg/kgd by gavage for the last 12 weeks of the 16-week period. We found that diet-induced insulin resistance induced Aβ overproduction with altered expression of Aβ metabolism-associated molecules, which corresponded with increased β-secretase-1 (BACE1), γ-secretase (PS-1) activities and decreased insulin degrading enzyme (IDE) activities, but not neprilysin in the cortex and hippocampus. Additionally, pioglitazone treatment prevented all these observed abnormalities. This study indicates that insulin resistance induced by fructose-drinking affects the expression of Aβ metabolism-associated molecules that are responsible for Aβ deposition and pioglitazone treatment negatively modulate amyloidogenesis.","1879-0712","European journal of pharmacology","(664) 14-9",2011,"Dingzhen","Luo","D","Department of Senile Neurology, Provincial Hospital affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan, Shandong, PR China."

The search for therapeutic strategies that lower these peptides has mainly focused on the proteolytic processing of the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP), and other post-transcriptional pathways. The transcription factor specificity protein 1 (Sp1) is vital for the regulation of several genes involved in AD including APP and the beta site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1). We have previously reported that tolfenamic acid promotes the degradation of Sp1 protein (SP1) in pancreatic human cancer cells and mice tumors. This study examines the ability of tolfenamic acid to reduce SP1 levels, and thereby decrease APP transcription and Aβ levels in rodent brains. Tolfenamic acid was administered by oral gavage to C57BL/6 mice at variable dosages and for different time periods. Results have shown that tolfenamic acid was able to down regulate brain protein levels of SP1, APP, and Aβ. These findings demonstrate that interference with upstream transcriptional pathways can lower pathogenic intermediates associated with AD, and thus tolfenamic acid represents a novel approach for the development of a therapeutic intervention for AD.","1875-5828","Current Alzheimer research","(8) 385-92",2011,"L I","Adwan","LI","Department of Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, University of Rhode Island, Kingston, RI 02881, USA."

Elevated basal cortisol levels in AD patients suggest that glucocorticoids (GC) may contribute to the development and/or maintenance of AD. Amyloid plaques are the hallmark of AD, and they are considered to play an early role in the AD process. However, little is known about how their formation is regulated by stress and GC. Astrocyte accumulation is one of the earliest neuropathological changes in AD. Here, we report that GC elevated amyloid-β (Aβ) production in primary cultures of astrocytes by increasing amyloid precursor protein (APP) and β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 gene expression. Notably, GC administered to normal, middle-aged mice promoted the expression of APP and β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 in astrocytes, as determined by double immunofluorescence. Additionally, confocal microscopy and ELISA revealed that GC markedly reduced Aβ degradation and clearance by astrocytes in vitro, indicating a decreased neuroprotective capacity of the astrocytes. This may have been due to the decrease of several Aβ-degrading proteases, such as insulin-degrading enzyme and matrix metalloproteinase-9. These effects occurred through the activation of GC receptors. Taken together, our results demonstrate that GC can enhance the production of Aβ, reduce its degradation in astrocytes, and provide a molecular mechanism linking stress factors to AD. Our study suggests that GC can facilitate AD pathogenesis and that reducing GC in the elderly and early AD patients would be beneficial.","1945-7170","Endocrinology","(152) 2704-15",2011,"Yanyan","Wang","Y","Department of Medical Genetics, The Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400038, People's Republic of China."

Nrg1 exerts its signaling activity through interaction with its cognate ErbB receptors. Multiple membrane-anchored Nrg1 isoforms, present in six different membrane topologies, must be processed by a protease to initiate a signaling cascade. Here, we demonstrate that BACE1 and ADAM10 can process type I and III Nrg1 at two adjacent sites. Our cleavage site mapping experiments showed that the BACE1 cleavage site is located eight amino acids downstream of the ADAM10 cleavage site, and this order of cleavage is the opposite of amyloid precursor protein cleavage by these two enzymes. Cleavages were further confirmed via optimized electrophoresis. Cleavage of type I or III Nrg1 by ADAM10 and BACE1 released a signaling-capable N-terminal fragment (ntf), either Nrg1-ntfα or Nrg1-ntfβ, which could similarly activate an ErbB receptor as evidenced by increased phosphorylation of Akt and ERK, two downstream signaling molecules. Although both Nrg1-ntfα and Nrg1-ntfβ could initiate a common signaling cascade, inhibition or down-regulation of ADAM10 alone in a co-culture system did not affect normal myelination, whereas specific inhibition of BACE1 impaired normal myelination. Thus, processing of Nrg1 by BACE1 appears to be more critical for regulating myelination. Our results imply that a significant inhibition of BACE1 could potentially impair Nrg1 signaling activity in vivo.","1083-351X","The Journal of biological chemistry","(286) 23967-74",2011,"Xiaoyang","Luo","X","Department of Neurosciences, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, Ohio 44195, USA."

Therefore we searched for additional β-secretases and identified three cathepsins that split the WT β-site much faster. Human cathepsin S cleaves the WT β-site (k(cat)/K(m): 54 700 m(-1) s(-1)) 1170-fold faster than BACE1 and cathepsins B and L are 440- and 74-fold faster than BACE1, respectively. These cathepsins split two bonds flanking the WT β-site (K-MD-A), where the K-M bond (85%) is cleaved more efficiently than the D-A bond (15%). Cleavage at the major K-M bond yields Aβ (amyloid β-peptide) extended by N-terminal Met that should be removed to generate Aβ initiated by Asp1. The activity of cytosol and microsomal aminopeptidases on relevant peptides revealed rapid removal of N-terminal Met but not N-terminal Asp. Brain aminopeptidases showed similar specificity. Thus, aminopeptidases would convert Aβ extended by Met into regular Aβ (Asp1) found in amyloid plaques. Earlier studies indicate that Aβ is likely produced in the endosome and lysosome system where cathepsins S, B and L are localized and cysteine cathepsin inhibitors reduce the level of Aβ in cells and animals. Taken together, cathepsins S, B and L deserve further evaluation as therapeutic targets to develop disease modifying drugs to treat Alzheimer's disease.","1437-4315","Biological chemistry","(392) 555-69",2011,"Israel","Schechter","I","Yenuvun Research Laboratory, Rehovot 76380, Israel."

BACE1's binding site is partially covered by a flexible loop on its N-terminal domain, known as the ""flap,"" which has been found in several conformations in crystal structures of BACE1 and other aspartyl proteases. The side chain of the invariant residue Tyr71 on the flap adopts several rotameric orientations, leading to our hypothesis that the orientation of this residue dictates the movement and conformations available to the flap. We investigated this hypothesis by performing 220 ns of molecular dynamics simulations of bound and unbound wild-type BACE1 as well as the unbound Y71A mutant. Our findings indicate that the flap exhibits various degrees of mobility and adopts different conformations depending on the Tyr71 orientation. Surprisingly, the ""self-inhibited"" form is stable in our simulations, making it a reasonable target for drug design. The alanine mutant, lacking a large side chain at position 71, displays significant differences in flap dynamics from wild type, freely sampling very open and closed conformations. Our simulations show that Tyr71, in addition to its previously determined functions in catalysis and substrate binding, has the important role of modulating flap conformations in BACE1.","1097-0134","Proteins","(79) 2247-59",2011,"Steven A","Spronk","SA","Department of Medicinal Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA. steven.spronk@bms.com"

Diabetic metabolic disorder contributes to β-amyloid protein (Aβ) generation. The goal of this study was to determine the effect of minocycline on Aβ generation and the NF-κB pathway in the hippocampus of diabetic rats and to elucidate the neuroprotective mechanisms of minocycline for the treatment of diabetic metabolic disorder. The diabetic rat model was established using a high-fat diet and an intraperitoneal injection of streptozocin (STZ). Behavioral tests showed that the capacity of learning and memory was significantly lower in diabetic rats. The levels of NF-κB, COX-2, iNOS, IL-1β and TNF-α after the STZ injection were significantly increased in the hippocampus. Significant increases in Aβ, BACE1, NF-κB, COX-2, iNOS, IL-1β and TNF-α were found in diabetic rats. The levels of Aβ, NF-κB, COX-2, iNOS, IL-1β and TNF-α were significantly decreased after minocycline administration; however, minocycline had no effect on BACE1 expression. In sum, diabetes contributes to the activation of the NF-κB pathway and upregulates BACE1 and Aβ.

NRG1 mediated signaling is crucial for cardiogenesis and the development of the breast. In the nervous system, NRG1 functions are essential for peripheral myelination, the establishment and maintenance of neuromuscular and sensorimotoric systems as well as for the plasticity of cortical neuronal circuits. There is strong evidence that deregulation of NRG1 is involved in breast cancer and schizophrenia. Many splice variants of NRG1 are expressed in the brain and all contain an EGF-like domain, which exerts the NRG1 function by limited proteolysis from its membrane bound precursor protein. In addition, most NRG1 isoforms contain a transmembrane domain, which is processed by γ-secretase after shedding. β-Secretase (β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1; BACE1) has been identified based on its role as the rate limiting enzyme of amyloid-β-peptide (Aβ) production. Aβ is the major component of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer`s disease (AD). More recently it was shown that Neuregulin-1 activity is highly dependent on the cleavage by BACE1 during early postnatal development. In BACE1 KO mice a role for BACE1 dependent proteolysis of NRG1 in the process of peripheral myelination could be demonstrated.

21613622,"A therapeutic antibody targeting BACE1 inhibits amyloid-β production in vivo.","Reducing production of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide by direct inhibition of the enzymes that process amyloid precursor protein (APP) is a central therapeutic strategy for treating Alzheimer's disease. However, small-molecule inhibitors of the β-secretase (BACE1) and γ-secretase APP processing enzymes have shown a lack of target selectivity and poor penetrance of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Here, we have developed a high-affinity, phage-derived human antibody that targets BACE1 (anti-BACE1) and is anti-amyloidogenic. Anti-BACE1 reduces endogenous BACE1 activity and Aβ production in human cell lines expressing APP and in cultured primary neurons. Anti-BACE1 is highly selective and does not inhibit the related enzymes BACE2 or cathepsin D. Competitive binding assays and x-ray crystallography indicate that anti-BACE1 binds noncompetitively to an exosite on BACE1 and not to the catalytic site. Systemic dosing of mice and nonhuman primates with anti-BACE1 resulted in sustained reductions in peripheral Aβ peptide concentrations. Anti-BACE1 also reduces central nervous system Aβ concentrations in mouse and monkey, consistent with a measurable uptake of antibody across the BBB. Thus, BACE1 can be targeted in a highly selective manner through passive immunization with anti-BACE1, providing a potential approach for treating Alzheimer's disease.

Cathepsin B cleaves the wild-type β-secretase site sequence in AβPP to produce Aβ, and cathepsin B inhibitors administered to animal models expressing AβPP containing the wild-type β-secretase site sequence reduce brain Aβ in a manner consistent with β-secretase inhibition. But such inhibitors could act either by direct inhibition of cathepsin B β-secretase activity or by off-target inhibition of the other β-secretase, the aspartyl protease BACE1. To evaluate that issue, we orally administered a cysteine protease inhibitor, E64d, to normal guinea pigs or transgenic mice expressing human AβPP, both of which express the human wild-type β-secretase site sequence. In guinea pigs, oral E64d administration caused a dose-dependent reduction of up to 92% in brain, CSF, and plasma of Aβ40 and Aβ42, a reduction of up to 50% in the C-terminal β-secretase fragment (CTFβ), and a 91% reduction in brain cathepsin B activity, but increased brain BACE1 activity by 20%. In transgenic AD mice, oral E64d administration improved memory deficits and reduced brain Aβ40 and Aβ42, amyloid plaque, brain CTFβ, and brain cathepsin B activity, but increased brain BACE1 activity. We conclude that E64d likely reduces brain Aβ by inhibiting cathepsin B and not BACE1 β-secretase activity and that E64d therefore may have potential for treating AD patients.","1875-8908","Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD","(26) 387-408",2011,"Gregory","Hook","G","American Life Science Pharmaceuticals, San Diego, CA 92109, USA. ghook@alspinc.com"

21642424,"Loss of cleavage at β'-site contributes to apparent increase in β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) secretion by β-secretase (BACE1)-glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) processing of amyloid precursor protein.","Several lines of evidence implicate lipid raft microdomains in Alzheimer disease-associated β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) production. Notably, targeting β-secretase (β-site amyloid precursor protein (APP)-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1)) exclusively to lipid rafts by the addition of a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor to its ectodomain has been reported to elevate Aβ secretion. Paradoxically, Aβ secretion is not reduced by the expression of non-raft resident S-palmitoylation-deficient BACE1 (BACE1-4C/A (C474A/C478A/C482A/C485A)). We addressed this apparent discrepancy in raft microdomain-associated BACE1 processing of APP in this study. As previously reported, we found that expression of BACE1-GPI elevated Aβ secretion as compared with wild-type BACE1 (WTBACE1) or BACE1-4C/A. However, this increase occurred without any difference in the levels of APP ectodomain released following BACE1 cleavage (soluble APPβ), arguing against an overall increase in BACE1 processing of APP per se. Further analysis revealed that WTBACE1 cleaves APP at β- and β'-sites, generating +1 and +11 β-C-terminal fragments and secreting intact as well as N-terminally truncated Aβ. In contrast, three different BACE1-GPI chimeras preferentially cleaved APP at the β-site, mainly generating +1 β-C-terminal fragment and secreting intact Aβ. As a consequence, cells expressing BACE1-GPI secreted relatively higher levels of intact Aβ without an increase in BACE1 processing of APP. Markedly reduced cleavage at β'-site exhibited by BACE1-GPI was cell type-independent and insensitive to subcellular localization of APP or the pathogenic KM/NL mutant.

Many cellular factors can regulate the production of Aβ. In this study, we show that a family of proteins named Nogo receptor proteins (NgR1 to NgR3) regulates Aβ production via interaction with amyloid precursor protein (APP). Further mapping of the interacting domain indicates that a small region adjacent to the BACE1 cleavage site of APP mediates interaction of APP with Nogo receptor proteins. Our results also indicate that increased interaction between Nogo receptor and APP reduces surface expression of APP and favors processing of APP by BACE1. When NgR2 was ablated in AD transgenic mice expressing Swedish APP and PS1ΔE9, amyloid deposition was clearly reduced (0.66% of total measured area in APP(swe)/PS1ΔE9/NgR2(-/-) mice vs. 0.76% of total measured area in APP(swe)/PS1ΔE9 mice). Our results demonstrate that down-regulation of NgR expression is a potential approach for inhibiting amyloid deposition in AD patients.","1530-6860","FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology","(25) 3146-56",2011,"Xiangdong","Zhou","X","Department of Neurosciences, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA. yanr@ccf.org"

Sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC), a choline-containing sphingolipid, showed suppressive effect on Aβ production in PC12 cells which stably express Swedish mutant of amyloid precursor protein (APPsw). SPC (> 3 μM) significantly lowered the accumulation of Aβ40/42 and the expression of BACE1. However, the transcriptions of other APP processing enzymes like ADAM10 and PS1 were not affected by the SPC addition. Meanwhile, phosphocholine (PC) or other lysophospholipids, such as lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), sphingosyl-1-phosphate (S1P), did not alter BACE1 expression. Down-regulatory effect of SPC on BACE1 expression appeared to be mediated by NF-κB which is known to suppress the trans-activation of BACE1 promoter in PC12 cells. Here, the nuclear tanslocation of NF-κB was enhanced by SPC treatment in immune-fluorescent image analysis and NF-κB reporter assay. Furthermore, the catalytic activities of BACE1 and BACE2 were dose-dependently inhibited by SPC displaying IC₅₀ values of 2.79 μM and 12.05 μM, respectively. Overall, these data suggest that SPC has the potential to ameliorate Aβ pathology in neurons by down-regulating the BACE1-mediated amyloidogenic pathway.","1573-6903","Neurochemical research","(36) 2083-90",2011,"Hyoseok","Yi","H","Pharmacology Research Center, Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology, Yuseong, Daejeon 305-343, Korea."

Compared to APP, less is known about the proteolytic processing of APLP2, in particular in neurons, and the cleavage sites have not yet been determined. APLP2 is cleaved by the β-secretase BACE1 and additionally by an α-secretase activity. The two metalloproteases ADAM10 and ADAM17 have been suggested as candidate APLP2 α-secretases in cell lines. Here, we used RNA interference and found that ADAM10, but not ADAM17, is required for the constitutive α-secretase cleavage of APLP2 in HEK293 and SH-SY5Y cells. Likewise, in primary murine neurons knock-down of ADAM10 suppressed APLP2 α-secretase cleavage. Using mass spectrometry we determined the proteolytic cleavage sites in the APLP2 sequence. ADAM10 was found to cleave APLP2 after arginine 670, whereas BACE1 cleaves after leucine 659. Both cleavage sites are located in close proximity to the membrane. γ-secretase cleavage was found to occur at different peptide bonds between alanine 694 and valine 700, which is close to the N-terminus of the predicted APLP2 transmembrane domain.

Some FAD-based mouse models produce amyloid plaques, others do not. β-Amyloid (Aβ) deposition can manifest as compact and diffuse plaques; it is unclear why the same Aβ molecules aggregate in different patterns. Is there a basic cellular process governing Aβ plaque pathogenesis? We showed in some FAD mouse models that compact plaque formation is associated with a progressive axonal pathology inherent with increased expression of β-secretase (BACE1), the enzyme initiating the amyloidogenic processing of APP. A monoclonal Aβ antibody, 3D6, visualized distinct axon terminal labeling before plaque onset. The present study was set to understand BACE1 and axonal changes relative to diffuse plaque development and to further characterize the novel axonal Aβ antibody immunoreactivity (IR), using triple transgenic AD (3xTg-AD) mice as experimental model. Diffuse-like plaques existed in the forebrain in aged transgenics and were regionally associated with increased BACE1 labeled swollen/sprouting axon terminals. Increased BACE1/3D6 IR at axon terminals occurred in young animals before plaque onset. These axonal elements were also co-labeled by other antibodies targeting the N-terminal and mid-region of Aβ domain and the C-terminal of APP, but not co-labeled by antibodies against the Aβ C-terminal and APP N-terminal. The results suggest that amyloidogenic axonal pathology precedes diffuse plaque formation in the 3xTg-AD mice, and that the early-onset axonal Aβ antibody IR in transgenic models of AD might relate to a cross-reactivity of putative APP β-carboxyl terminal fragments.","1476-3524","Neurotoxicity research","(21) 160-74",2012,"Yan","Cai","Y","Department of Human Anatomy and Neurobiology, Central South University Xiangya School of Medicine, Changsha, Hunan 410013, China."

In addition, we show for the first time the involvement of SREBP2 on expression of BACE1 in SK-N-BE cells exposed to high cholesterol. Although the enhanced risk of Alzheimer's disease in metabolic syndrome is related to several factors, our results suggest that SREBP2, which can be modulated by the impairment of cerebral cholesterol homeostasis, has a direct role on BACE1 expression and may be involved in Alzheimer's disease progression.","1095-953X","Neurobiology of disease","(44) 116-24",2011,"Raffaella","Mastrocola","R","Department of Experimental Medicine and Oncology, University of Turin, Italy. raffaella.mastrocola@unito.it"
21738672,"Activation of PKR causes amyloid ß-peptide accumulation via de-repression of BACE1 expression.","BACE1 is a key enzyme involved in the production of amyloid ß-peptide (Aß) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains. Normally, its expression is constitutively inhibited due to the presence of the 5'untranslated region (5'UTR) in the BACE1 promoter. BACE1 expression is activated by phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)2-alpha, which reverses the inhibitory effect exerted by BACE1 5'UTR. There are four kinases associated with different types of stress that could phosphorylate eIF2-alpha. Here we focus on the double-stranded (ds) RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR). PKR is activated during viral infection, including that of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1), a virus suggested to be implicated in the development of AD, acting when present in brains of carriers of the type 4 allele of the apolipoprotein E gene. HSV1 is a dsDNA virus but it has genes on both strands of the genome, and from these genes complementary RNA molecules are transcribed. These could activate BACE1 expression by the PKR pathway. Here we demonstrate in HSV1-infected neuroblastoma cells, and in peripheral nervous tissue from HSV1-infected mice, that HSV1 activates PKR. Cloning BACE1 5'UTR upstream of a luciferase (luc) gene confirmed its inhibitory effect, which can be prevented by salubrinal, an inhibitor of the eIF2-alpha phosphatase PP1c. Treatment with the dsRNA analog poly (I∶C) mimicked the stimulatory effect exerted by salubrinal over BACE1 translation in the 5'UTR-luc construct and increased Aß production in HEK-APPsw cells. Summarizing, our data suggest that PKR activated in brain by HSV1 could play an important role in the development of AD.","1932-6203","PloS one","(6) e21456",2011,"Gerard","Ill-Raga","G","Laboratory of Molecular Physiology and Channelopathies, Department of Experimental and Health Sciences, Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain."
21785702,"Knockdown of BACE1-AS Nonprotein-Coding Transcript Modulates Beta-Amyloid-Related Hippocampal Neurogenesis.","Background. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurological disorder and the main cause of dementia in the elderly population worldwide. Adult neurogenesis appears to be upregulated very early in AD pathogenesis in response to some specific aggregates of beta-amyloid (Aβ) peptides, exhausting the neuronal stem cell pools in the brain. Previously, we characterized a conserved nonprotein-coding antisense transcript for β-secretase-1 (BACE1), a critical enzyme in AD pathophysiology. We showed that the BACE1-antisense transcript (BACE1-AS) is markedly upregulated in brain samples from AD patients and promotes the stability of the (sense) BACE1 transcript. In the current paper, we examine the relationship between BACE1, BACE1-AS, adult neurogenesis markers, and amyloid plaque formation in amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice (Tg-19959) of various ages. Results. Consistent with previous publications in other APP overexpressing mouse models, we found adult neurogenesis markers to be noticeably upregulated in Tg-19959 mice very early in the development of the disease. Knockdown of either one of BACE1 or BACE1-AS transcripts by continuous infusion of locked nucleic acid- (LNA-) modified siRNAs into the third ventricle over the period of two weeks caused concordant downregulation of both transcripts in Tg-19959 mice. Downregulation of BACE1 mRNA was followed by reduction of BACE1 protein and insoluble Aβ. Modulation of BACE1 and BACE1-AS transcripts also altered oligomeric Aβ aggregation pattern, which was in turn associated with an increase in neurogenesis markers at the RNA and protein level. Conclusion. We found alterations in the RNA and protein concentrations of several adult neurogenesis markers, as well as non-protein-coding BACE1-AS transcripts, in parallel with the course of β-amyloid synthesis and aggregation in the brain of Tg15999 mice. In addition, by knocking down BACE1 or BACE1-AS (thereby reducing Aβ production and plaque deposition), we were able to modulate expression of these neurogenesis markers. Our findings suggest a distortion of adult neurogenesis that is associated with Aβ production very early in amyloid pathogenesis. We believe that these alterations, at the molecular level, could prove useful as novel therapeutic targets and/or as early biomarkers of AD.","2090-0252","International journal of Alzheimer's disease","(2011) 929042",2011,"Farzaneh","Modarresi","F","Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, 1501 NW 10th Avenue Miami, FL 33136, USA."

Cleavage of APP by the β-secretase BACE1 is the rate-limiting step in the production of Aβ. We have reported previously that the cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) inhibited the action of BACE1 toward human wild type APP (APP(WT)) in cellular models and that the levels of endogenous murine Aβ were significantly increased in PrP(C)-null mouse brain. Here we investigated the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying this observation. PrP(C) interacted directly with the prodomain of the immature Golgi-localized form of BACE1. This interaction decreased BACE1 at the cell surface and in endosomes where it preferentially cleaves APP(WT) but increased it in the Golgi where it preferentially cleaves APP with the Swedish mutation (APP(Swe)). In transgenic mice expressing human APP with the Swedish and Indiana familial mutations (APP(Swe,Ind)), PrP(C) deletion had no influence on APP proteolytic processing, Aβ plaque deposition, or levels of soluble Aβ or Aβ oligomers. In cells, although PrP(C) inhibited the action of BACE1 on APP(WT), it did not inhibit BACE1 activity toward APP(Swe). The differential subcellular location of the BACE1 cleavage of APP(Swe) relative to APP(WT) provides an explanation for the failure of PrP(C) deletion to affect Aβ accumulation in APP(Swe,Ind) mice. Thus, although PrP(C) exerts no control on cleavage of APP(Swe) by BACE1, it has a profound influence on the cleavage of APP(WT), suggesting that PrP(C) may be a key protective player against sporadic Alzheimer disease.","1083-351X","The Journal of biological chemistry","(286) 33489-500",2011,"Heledd H","Griffiths","HH","Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Faculty of Biological Sciences, University of Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, United Kingdom."

We previously found that 4-O-methylhonokiol, a compound extracted from Magnolia officinalis, improved memory dysfunction in Aβ-injected and presenilin 2 mutant mice through the reduction of accumulated Aβ. To investigate mechanisms of the reduced Aβ accumulation, we examined generation, degradation, efflux and aggregation of Aβ in Swedish AβPP AD model (AβPPsw) mice pre-treated with 4-O-methylhonokiol (1.0 mg/kg) for 3 months. 4-O-methylhonokiol treatment recovered memory impairment and prevented neuronal cell death. This memory improving activity was associated with 4-O-methylhonokiol-induced reduction of Aβ1-42 accumulation in the brains of AβPPsw mice. According to the reduction of Aβ1-42 accumulation, 4-O-methylhonkiol modulated oxidative damage sensitive enzymes. 4-O-methylhonkiol decreased expression and activity of brain beta-site AβPP cleaving enzyme (BACE1), but increased clearance of Aβ in the brain through an increase of expressions and activities of Aβ degradation enzymes; insulin degrading enzyme and neprilysin. 4-O-methylhonkiol also increased expression of Aβ transport molecule, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 in the brain and liver. 4-O-methylhonkiol decreased carbonyl protein and lipid peroxidation, but increased glutathione levels in the brains of AβPPsw mice suggesting that oxidative damage of protein and lipid is critical in the impairment of those enzyme activities. 4-O-methylhonokiol treatment also prevented neuronal cell death in the AβPPsw mousee brain through inactivation of caspase-3 and BAX.

As Aβ reductions in mice lacking one BACE1 allele diverged considerably between studies we investigated the effect of BACE1 knock-out in more detail. With both BACE1 alleles the Swedish mutation (APP23 mice) increased APP processing and shifted it towards the β-secretase pathway as compared with non-mutated APP expressed at a similar level (APP51/16 mice). This effect was much smaller then observed in cell culture. An about 50% decrease in BACE1 enzyme activity resulted in a sub-proportional Aβ reduction with the Swedish mutation (-20%) and even less for non-mutated APP (-16%). In wild-type mice, the Aβ reduction may be even further diminished. Other metabolites of the β-secretase pathway decreased accordingly while the alternative α-secretase pathway increased. Complete BACE1 deletion strongly enhanced these changes. The remaining Aβ signal also described by others can be explained by assay cross-reactivity with other APP metabolites supporting BACE1 as the major β-secretase. Our data indicate that BACE1 is in excess over APP at the cleavage site(s). Alterations in APP expression or substrate properties, therefore, quantitatively change its cleavage and Aβ generation.","1471-4159","Journal of neurochemistry","(119) 231-9",2011,"Sabine","Rabe","S","Neuroscience Discovery, Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Basel, Switzerland."

Both the scFv displayed on phage and EV-IgG1 show exquisite specificity for binding to the EV neoepitope without cross-reactivity to other NFEV containing peptides or WT-APP KMDA cleavage products. EV-IgG1 can detect as little as 0.3 nmol/L of the EV peptide. EV-IgG1 antibody was purified, conjugated with alkaline phosphatase and utilized in various biological assays. In the BACE1 enzymatic assay using NFEV substrate, a BACE1 inhibitor MRK-3 inhibited cleavage with an IC(50) of 2.4 nmol/L with excellent reproducibility. In an APP_NFEV stable SH-SY5Y cellular assay, the EC(50) for inhibition of EV-Aβ peptide secretion with MRK-3 was 236 nmol/L, consistent with values derived using an EV polyclonal antibody. In an APP_NFEV knock-in mouse model, both Aβ_EV40 and Aβ_EV42 peptides in brain homogenate showed excellent gene dosage dependence.

21825135,"ADP ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) controls amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing by mediating the endosomal sorting of BACE1.","Amyloid β (Aβ) peptides, the primary constituents of senile plaques and a hallmark in Alzheimer's disease pathology, are generated through the sequential cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and γ-secretase. The early endosome is thought to represent a major compartment for APP processing; however, the mechanisms of how BACE1 encounters APP are largely unknown. In contrast to APP internalization, which is clathrin-dependent, we demonstrate that BACE1 is sorted to early endosomes via a route controlled by the small GTPase ADP ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6). Altering ARF6 levels or its activity affects endosomal sorting of BACE1, and consequently results in altered APP processing and Aβ production. Furthermore, sorting of newly internalized BACE1 from ARF6-positive towards RAB GTPase 5 (RAB5)-positive early endosomes depends on its carboxyterminal short acidic cluster-dileucine motif. This ARF6-mediated sorting of BACE1 is confined to the somatodendritic compartment of polarized neurons in agreement with Aβ peptides being primarily secreted from here. These results demonstrate a spatial separation between APP and BACE1 during surface-to-endosome transport, suggesting subcellular trafficking as a regulatory mechanism for this proteolytic processing step. It thereby provides a novel avenue to interfere with Aβ production through a selective modulation of the distinct endosomal transport routes used by BACE1 or APP.","1091-6490","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","(108) E559-68",2011,"Ragna","Sannerud","R","Laboratory of Membrane Trafficking, Center for Human Genetics, Catholic University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium."

However, chronic ART-treated patients frequently develop age-dependent complications, including dementia, diabetes, and hyperlipidemia: all risk factors of Alzheimer's disease. Importantly, the effect of ART compounds on amyloid generation and clearance has never been systematically examined. Nine prescribed HIV protease inhibitors were tested for their effect on amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) clearance in primary cultured human monocyte-derived macrophages. Atazanavir, ritonavir, and saquinavir modestly inhibited of Aβ degradation, while lopinavir, nelfinavir, and ritonavir enhanced secretion of undigested Aβ after phagocytosis. Lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, and saquinavir inhibited endogenous Aβ40 production from primary cultured human cortical neurons, which were associated with reduction in Beta-site APP Converting Enzyme 1 (BACE1) and γ-secretase enzyme activities. However, ART compounds showed little inhibition of purified BACE1 activity in vitro, suggesting the indirect effect of ART compounds on BACE1 activity in neurons. Finally, nefinavir or lopinavir/ritonavir (Kaletra) were orally administered for 30 days into APP SCID mice expressing a double mutant form of APP 695 (KM670/671NL + V717F) in homozygosity for the scid allele of Prkdc. There was no difference in beta-amyloidosis by ART drug administration as determined by both immunohistochemistry and ELISA measurements although the therapeutic doses of the ART compounds was present in the brain. These data demonstrated that ART drugs can inhibit Aβ clearance in macrophages and Aβ production in neurons, but these effects did not significantly alter Aβ accumulation in the mouse brain.","1557-1904","Journal of neuroimmune pharmacology : the official journal of the Society on NeuroImmune Pharmacology","(7) 412-23",2012,"Xiqian","Lan","X","Department of Pharmacology and Experimental Neuroscience, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198-5880, USA."

Among a diversity of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family members, JNK and p38 MAPK subfamilies are relevant to the response of environmental stress, inflammatory stimuli, or other insults. Recent studies have demonstrated that epigenetic mechanisms may play a pivotal role in AD pathogenesis and development. In the present study, we have investigated epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation and histone acetylation involved in the activation of stress-related signaling pathways for amyloid-β (Aβ) production. Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were treated by anisomycin, an activator of stress-related MAPKs (JNK and p38 MAPK). A significant increase of intracellular Aβ level in anisomycin-treated SH-SY5Y cells was observed. The expression of amyloid-β precursor protein (APP), β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), and presenilin 1 (PS1) was upregulated by demethylation in three gene promoters associated with the reduction of methyltransferases (DNMTs). Meanwhile, an enhanced level of global histone H3 acetylation accompanied with upregulation of histone acetyltransferases p300/CREB-binding protein (CBP) and downregulation of histone deacetylases (HDACs) was also observed. These findings indicated that the activation of stress-related signaling pathways could result in the increased transcription of APP, BACE1, and PS1 genes through DNMT-dependent hypomethylation and histone H3 hyperacetylation, thus leading to Aβ overproduction. Moreover, our findings provided a novel insight into epigenetic mechanisms by which oxidative stress contributes to the pathogenesis of AD.","1873-7544","Neuroscience","(194) 272-81",2011,"X","Guo","X","Department of Pathology, Capital Medical University, Beijing 100069, China."

An essential feature of AD pathology is the presence of BACE1 (β-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1), which regulates production of toxic amyloid peptides. However, whether BACE1 also plays a role in glucose homoeostasis is presently unknown. We have used transgenic mice to analyse the effects of loss of BACE1 on body weight, and lipid and glucose homoeostasis. BACE1-/- mice are lean, with decreased adiposity, higher energy expenditure, and improved glucose disposal and peripheral insulin sensitivity than wild-type littermates. BACE1-/- mice are also protected from diet-induced obesity. BACE1-deficient skeletal muscle and liver exhibit improved insulin sensitivity. In a skeletal muscle cell line, BACE1 inhibition increased glucose uptake and enhanced insulin sensitivity. The loss of BACE1 is associated with increased levels of UCP1 (uncoupling protein 1) in BAT (brown adipose tissue) and UCP2 and UCP3 mRNA in skeletal muscle, indicative of increased uncoupled respiration and metabolic inefficiency. Thus BACE1 levels may play a critical role in glucose and lipid homoeostasis in conditions of chronic nutrient excess. Therefore strategies that ameliorate BACE1 activity may be important novel approaches for the treatment of diabetes.","1470-8728","The Biochemical journal","(441) 285-96",2012,"Paul J","Meakin","PJ","Division of Cardiovascular and Diabetes Medicine, Medical Research Institute, Ninewells Hospital and Medical School, University of Dundee, Dundee DD1 9SY, Scotland, U.K."

In the present study we have screened ten BACE1 antibodies by Western blot and several antibody pairs to develop a new BACE1 sandwich ELISA procedure. We identified one pair that showed little background and good reproducibility. Several dilution buffers and sample denaturation methods were tried to partially unfold BACE1 before capture. We found that dilution in PBS followed by 10 min incubation at 50°C critically improves the performance of the assay. Finally, we successfully measured BACE1 levels in a few human brain and platelet lysates as well as in plasma and AD CSF.

Accumulation in brain tissue of small, soluble aggregates of Aβ42 is the major pathogenic event of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the physiologic activity of Aβ peptides is still elusive.

These findings unveil a positive feedback loop in which γ-secretase cleavage of AβPP releases a functionally-active peptide, Aβ42, that promotes BACE1 transcription. Thus, gene expression induced by Aβ42 may have implications in the neuronal dysfunction and degeneration that occurs in AD.","1875-8908","Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD","(27) 871-83",2011,"Michela","Guglielmotto","M","Department of Experimental Medicine and Oncology, General Pathology Section, University of Torino, Torino, Italy."

However, the efficacy and safety profile of BDNF therapy (eg, gene delivery) remains to be established toward clinical trials. Here, we evaluated the effects of 7,8-dihydroxyflavone (7,8-DHF), a recently identified small-molecule TrkB agonist that can pass the blood-brain barrier, in the 5XFAD transgenic mouse model of AD. 5XFAD mice at 12-15 months of age and non-transgenic littermate controls received systemic administration of 7,8-DHF (5 mg/kg, i.p.) once daily for 10 consecutive days. We found that 7,8-DHF rescued memory deficits of 5XFAD mice in the spontaneous alternation Y-maze task. 5XFAD mice showed impairments in the hippocampal BDNF-TrkB pathway, as evidenced by significant reductions in BDNF, TrkB receptors, and phosphorylated TrkB. 7,8-DHF restored deficient TrkB signaling in 5XFAD mice without affecting endogenous BDNF levels. Meanwhile, 5XFAD mice exhibited elevations in the β-secretase enzyme (BACE1) that initiates amyloid-β (Aβ) generation, as observed in sporadic AD. Interestingly, 7,8-DHF blocked BACE1 elevations and lowered levels of the β-secretase-cleaved C-terminal fragment of amyloid precursor protein (C99), Aβ40, and Aβ42 in 5XFAD mouse brains. Furthermore, BACE1 expression was decreased by 7,8-DHF in wild-type mice, suggesting that BDNF-TrkB signaling is also important for downregulating baseline levels of BACE1. Together, our findings indicate that TrkB activation with systemic 7,8-DHF can ameliorate AD-associated memory deficits, which may be, at least in part, attributable to reductions in BACE1 expression and β-amyloidogenesis.","1740-634X","Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology","(37) 434-44",2012,"Latha","Devi","L","Center for Dementia Research, Nathan Kline Institute, Orangeburg, NY 10962, USA."

For detailed molecular studies of sodium channel regulation, biochemical methods are now complementing classical electrophysiology. To understand how BACE1 regulates sodium current densities in our studies, we setup conditions to analyze surface levels of the pore-forming Nav1 α-subunits. By using a cell surface biotinylation protocol, we found that elevated BACE1 activity significantly decreases surface Nav1 α-subunit levels in both neuroblastoma cells and acutely prepared hippocampal slices. This finding would explain the decreased sodium currents shown by standard electrophysiological methods. The biochemical methods used in our studies would be applicable to analyses of surface expression levels of other ion channels as well as Nav1 in cells and adult hippocampal neurons.","1940-6029","Methods in molecular biology (Clifton, N.J.)","(793) 351-61",2011,"Doo Yeon","Kim","DY","Neurobiology of Disease Laboratory, Genetics and Aging Research Unit, MassGeneral Institute for Neurodegenerative Disease, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Charlestown, MA, USA. dkim@helix.mgh.harvard.edu"

Emerging evidence indicates that amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides enter mitochondria and may thereby disrupt mitochondrial function in brains of AD patients and transgenic model mice. However, it remains to be determined whether the β-cleaved C-terminal fragment (C99), another neurotoxic fragment of amyloid precursor protein (APP), may accumulate in mitochondria of neurons affected by AD. Using immunoblotting, digitonin fractionation and immunofluorescence labeling techniques, we found that C99 is targeted to mitochondria, in particular, to the mitoplast (i.e., inner membrane and matrix compartments) in brains of AD transgenic mice (5XFAD model). Furthermore, full-length APP (fl-APP) was also identified in mitochondrial fractions of 5XFAD mice. Remarkably, partial deletion of the β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1(+/-)) almost completely abolished mitochondrial targeting of C99 and fl-APP in 5XFAD mice at 6 months of age. However, substantial amounts of C99 and fl-APP accumulation remained in mitochondria of 12-month-old BACE1(+/-)·5XFAD mouse brains. Consistent with these changes in mitochondrial C99/fl-APP levels, BACE1(+/-) deletion age-dependently rescued mitochondrial dysfunction in 5XFAD mice, as assessed by cytochrome c release from mitochondria, reduced redox or complex activities and oxidative DNA damage. Moreover, BACE1(+/-) deletion also improved memory deficits as tested by the spontaneous alternation Y-maze task in 5XFAD mice at 6 months but not at 12 months of age. Taken together, our findings suggest that mitochondrial accumulation of C99 and fl-APP may occur through BACE1-dependent mechanisms and contribute to inducing mitochondrial dysfunction and cognitive impairments associated with AD.","1095-953X","Neurobiology of disease","(45) 417-24",2012,"Latha","Devi","L","Center for Dementia Research, Nathan Kline Institute, Orangeburg, NY 10962, USA."

The findings are supported by genetic linkage and association studies that have clearly identified several genes involved in cholesterol metabolism or transport as AD susceptibility genes, including apolipoprotein E, apolipoprotein J, and the sortilin-related receptor. Functional cell biology studies support a critical involvement of lipid raft cholesterol in the modulation of amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP) processing by β- and γ-secretase resulting in altered amyloid-β production. Contradictory evidence comes from epidemiological studies showing no or controversial association between dyslipidemia and AD risk. Additionally, cell biology studies suggest that there is little exchange between circulating and brain cholesterol, that increased membrane cholesterol is protective by inhibiting loss of membrane integrity through amyloid cytotoxicity, and that cellular cholesterol inhibits co-localization of BACE1 and AβPP in non-raft membrane domains, thereby increasing generation of plasmin, an amyloid-β-degrading enzyme. The aim of this review is to summarize the findings of epidemiological and cell biological studies to elucidate the role of cholesterol in AD etiology.","1875-8908","Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD","(30 Suppl 2) S127-45",2012,"Christiane","Reitz","C","The Gertrude H.

Moreover, we also found that, in an Alzheimer's mouse model, genetic deletion of TNF receptor (TNFR1) reduces amyloid plaques and amyloid beta peptides (Aβ) production through β-secretase (BACE1) regulation. TNF-α converting enzyme (TACE/ADAM-17) does not only cleave pro- TNF-α but also TNF receptors, however, whether the TACE activity was changed in the CSF was not clear. In this study, we examined TACE in the CSF in 32 AD patients and 27 age-matched healthy controls (HCs). Interestingly, we found that TACE activity was significantly elevated in the CSF from AD patients compared with HCs. Furthermore, we also assayed the CSF levels of TACE cleaved soluble forms of TNFR1 and TNFR2 in the same patients. We found that AD patients had higher levels of both TACE cleaved soluble TNFR1 (sTNFR1) and TNFR2 (sTNFR2) in the CSF compared to age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Levels of sTNFR1 correlated strongly with the levels of sTNFR2 (rs = 0.567-0.663, p < 0.01). The levels of both sTNFR1 and sTNFR2 significantly correlated with the TACE activity (rs = 0.491-0.557, p < 0.05). To examine if changes in TACE activity and in levels of cleaved soluble TNFRs are an early event in the course of AD, we measured these molecules in the CSF from 47 subjects with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which is considered as a preclinical stage of AD. Unexpectedly, we found significantly higher levels of TACE activity and soluble TNFRs in the MCI group than that in AD patients.

Recently, HupA was shown to be active in modulating the nonamyloidogenic metabolism of β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) in APP-transfected human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK293swe). However, in vivo research concerning the mechanism of HupA in APP transgenic mice has not yet been fully elucidated. The present study indicates that the loss of dendritic spine density and synaptotagmin levels in the brain of APPswe/presenilin-1 (PS1) transgenic mice was significantly ameliorated by chronic HupA treatment and provides evidence that this neuroprotection was associated with reduced amyloid plaque burden and oligomeric β-amyloid (Aβ) levels in the cortex and hippocampus of APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice. Our findings further demonstrate that the amelioration effect of HupA on Aβ deposits may be mediated, at least in part, by regulation of the compromised expression of a disintegrin and metalloprotease 10 (ADAM10) and excessive membrane trafficking of β-site APP cleavage enzyme 1 (BACE1) in these transgenic mice. In addition, extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 (Erk1/2) phosphorylation may also be partially involved in the effect of HupA on APP processing. In conclusion, our work for the first time demonstrates the neuroprotective effect of HupA on synaptic deficits in APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice and further clarifies the potential pharmacological targets for this protective effect, in which modulation of nonamyloidogenic and amyloidogenic APP processing pathways may be both involved.

The aged rats exhibited obvious learning and (or) memory deficit when compared with the young rats, but TSG treatment significantly improved the learning and (or) memory ability in the aged rats, as noted from the MWM test. RT-PCR and Western blot analysis showed an increase in the expression of beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and A Disintegrin And Metalloproteinase 17 (ADAM17) in aged rats, and a decrease in ADAM10; however, TSG treatment significantly increased the mRNA and protein expression of ADAM10 (p < 0.01, compared with aged control rats). These results provide solid evidence for the therapeutic effect of TSG on age-related cognitive impairment, especially spatial learning and memory deficit. TSG might exert this effect through the APP pathway, although further studies on the topic are required.","1205-7541","Canadian journal of physiology and pharmacology","(89) 801-9",2011,"Ying","Hou","Y","Department of Neurology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, People's Republic of China."
22036569,"Arc/Arg3.1 regulates an endosomal pathway essential for activity-dependent β-amyloid generation.","Assemblies of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides are pathological mediators of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and are produced by the sequential cleavages of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β-secretase (BACE1) and γ-secretase. The generation of Aβ is coupled to neuronal activity, but the molecular basis is unknown. Here, we report that the immediate early gene Arc is required for activity-dependent generation of Aβ. Arc is a postsynaptic protein that recruits endophilin2/3 and dynamin to early/recycling endosomes that traffic AMPA receptors to reduce synaptic strength in both hebbian and non-hebbian forms of plasticity. The Arc-endosome also traffics APP and BACE1, and Arc physically associates with presenilin1 (PS1) to regulate γ-secretase trafficking and confer activity dependence. Genetic deletion of Arc reduces Aβ load in a transgenic mouse model of AD. In concert with the finding that patients with AD can express anomalously high levels of Arc, we hypothesize that Arc participates in the pathogenesis of AD.","1097-4172","Cell","(147) 615-28",2011,"Jing","Wu","J","Solomon H.

22045484,"The BACE1-PSEN-AβPP regulatory axis has an ancient role in response to low oxygen/oxidative stress.","Oxygen homeostasis is essential for the development and normal physiology of an organism. Hypoxia causes the mitochondrial electron transport chain to generate higher levels of reactive oxygen species resulting in oxidative stress. Hypoxia can be a direct consequence of hypoperfusion, a common vascular component among Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk factors, and may play an important role in AD pathogenesis. Beta-site amyloid-β A4 precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is responsible, with γ-secretase, for cleavage of the amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP) to produce amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide. A recent study observed that oxidative stress increases BACE1 expression via a regulatory pathway dependent on γ-secretase cleavage of AβPP and this increases Aβ peptide production. Zebrafish embryos represent normal cells in which complex and subtle manipulations of gene activity can be performed to facilitate analysis of genes involved in human disease. Here we identify and describe the expression of bace1, the zebrafish ortholog of human BACE1. We observe that the zebrafish AD-related genes bace1, psen1, psen2, appa, and appb all show increased mRNA levels under hypoxia. A dominant negative form of psen1 putatively blocking γ-secretase activity blocks bace1 upregulation under hypoxia. Hypoxia increases catalase gene mRNA indicating increased oxidative stress but we did not observe increased levels of F2-isoprostanes that indicate peroxidation of arachidonic acid, possibly due to relatively low levels of arachidonic acid in zebrafish. Our results demonstrate that upregulation of PSEN1 & 2, AβPP and the γ-secretase-dependent upregulation of BACE1 is an ancient, conserved, and thus selectively advantageous response to hypoxia/oxidative stress.","1875-8908","Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD","(28) 515-30",2012,"Seyyed Hani","Moussavi Nik","SH","Discipline of Genetics, School of Molecular and Biomedical Sciences, The University of Adelaide, SA, Australia. seyyed.moussavinik@adelaide.edu.au"
22046282,"Silencing GADD153/CHOP gene expression protects against Alzheimer's disease-like pathology induced by 27-hydroxycholesterol in rabbit hippocampus.","Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is suggested to play a key role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Sustained ER stress leads to activation of the growth arrest and leucine zipper transcription factor, DNA damage inducible gene 153 (gadd153; also called CHOP). Activated gadd153 can generate oxidative damage and reactive oxygen species (ROS), increase β-amyloid (Aβ) levels, disturb iron homeostasis and induce inflammation as well as cell death, which are all pathological hallmarks of AD. Epidemiological and laboratory studies suggest that cholesterol dyshomeostasis contributes to the pathogenesis of AD. We have previously shown that the cholesterol oxidized metabolite 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC) triggers AD-like pathology in organotypic slices. However, the extent to which gadd153 mediates 27-OHC effects has not been determined. We silenced gadd153 gene with siRNA and determined the effects of 27-OHC on AD hallmarks in organotypic slices from adult rabbit hippocampus. siRNA to gadd153 reduced 27-OHC-induced Aβ production by mechanisms involving reduction in levels of β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and β-secretase (BACE1), the enzyme that initiates cleavage of APP to yield Aβ peptides. Additionally, 27-OHC-induced tau phosphorylation, ROS generation, TNF-α activation, and iron and apoptosis-regulatory protein levels alteration were also markedly reduced by siRNA to gadd153. These data suggest that ER stress-mediated gadd153 activation plays a central role in the triggering of AD pathological hallmarks that result from incubation of hippocampal slices with 27-OHC. Our results add important insights into cellular mechanisms that underlie the potential contribution of cholesterol metabolism in AD pathology, and suggest that preventing gadd153 activation protects against AD related to cholesterol oxidized products.","1932-6203","PloS one","(6) e26420",2011,"Jaya R P","Prasanthi","JR","Department of Pharmacology, Physiology and Therapeutics, University of North Dakota School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Grand Forks, North Dakota, United States of America."

Moreover, activated astrocytes may increase Aβ generation. β-Site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) initiates Aβ production.

The CK-p25 inducible mouse model exhibits progressive neuronal death, elevated Aβ, reduced synaptic plasticity, and impaired learning following p25 overexpression in forebrain neurons. Levels of Aβ, as well as the APP processing enzyme, β-secretase (BACE1), are also increased in CK-p25 mice. It is unknown what role increased Aβ plays in the cognitive and neurodegenerative phenotype of the CK-p25 mouse. In the current work, we restored Aβ levels in the CK-p25 mouse to those of wild-type mice via the partial genetic deletion of BACE1, allowing us to examine the Aβ-independent phenotype of this mouse model. We show that, in the CK-p25 mouse, normalization of Aβ levels led to a rescue of synaptic and cognitive deficits. Conversely, neuronal loss was not ameliorated. Our findings indicate that increases in p25/Cdk5 activity may mediate cognitive and synaptic impairment via an Aβ-dependent pathway in the CK-p25 mouse.

22050745,"Multi-target-directed ligands in Alzheimer's disease treatment.","Among the various drug discovery methods, a very promising modern approach consists in designing multi-target-directed ligands (MTDLs). This methodology has been specifically developed for treatment of disorders with complex pathological mechanisms. One such disorder is Alzheimer's disease (AD), currently the most common multifactorial neurodegenerative disease. AD is related to increased levels of the amyloid β peptide (Aβ) and the hyperphosphorylated tau protein, along with loss of neurons and synapses. Moreover, there is some evidence pointing to the role of oxidative stress, metal ion deregulation, inflammation and cell cycle regulatory failure in its pathogenesis. There are many attractive targets for the development of anti-AD drugs, and the multi-factor nature of this disease calls for multi-target-directed compounds which can be beneficial for AD treatment. This review presents the discovery of dualand multi-acting anti-AD drug candidates, focusing on the novel design strategy and the compounds it yields - particularly hybrids obtained by linking structurally active moieties interacting with different targets. The first group of compounds includes cholinesterase inhibitors acting as dual binding site inhibitors and/or inhibitors with additional properties. These compounds are characterized by increased potency against acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and Aβ plaque formation with additional properties such as antioxidant activity, neuroprotective, and metal-complexing property, voltage-dependent calcium channel antagonistic activity, inhibitory activity against glutamate-induced excitotoxicity, histamine H(3) receptor antagonism, cannabinoid CB(1) receptor antagonism and β-secretase (BACE1) inhibition. A novel class of compounds represents the combination of dual BACE1 inhibitors with metal chelators, and dual modulators of γ-secretase with peroxisome proliferator-ativated receptor γ (PPARγ).

Neuronal overexpression of a NRG1 type III-variant, designed to mimic prior cleavage in the juxtamembrane stalk region, induces hypermyelination in vivo and is sufficient to restore myelination of NRG1 type III-deficient neurons. This observation implies that the NRG1 cytoplasmic domain is dispensable and that processed NRG1 type III is sufficient for all steps of myelination. Surprisingly, transgenic neuronal overexpression of full-length NRG1 type III promotes hypermyelination also in BACE1 null mutant mice. Moreover, NRG1 processing is impaired but not abolished in BACE1 null mutants. Thus, BACE1 is not essential for the activation of NRG1 type III to promote myelination.

There are two forms of the enzyme: β-site Aβ precursor protein cleaving enzyme (BACE) 1 and BACE2. Although BACE1 increases in late-stage AD, little is known about BACE2. We conducted a detailed examination of BACE2 in patients with preclinical to late-stage AD, including amnestic mild cognitive impairment, and age-matched controls, cases of frontotemporal dementia, and Down's syndrome. BACE2 protein and enzymatic activity increased as early as preclinical AD and were found in neurons and astrocytes. Although the levels of total BACE2 mRNA were unchanged, the mRNA for BACE2 splice form C (missing exon 7) increased in parallel with BACE2 protein and activity. BACE1 and BACE2 were strongly correlated with each other at all levels, suggesting that their regulatory mechanisms may be largely shared. BACE2 was also elevated in frontotemporal dementia but not in Down's syndrome, even in patients with substantial Aβ deposition. Thus, expression of both forms of β-secretase are linked and may play a combined role in human neurologic disease.

Aβ generation is initiated when β-secretase (BACE1) cleaves the amyloid precursor protein. For more than a decade, BACE1 has been a prime target for designing drugs to prevent or treat AD. However, development of such agents has turned out to be extremely challenging, with major hurdles in cell penetration, oral bioavailability/metabolic clearance, and brain access. Using a fragment-based chemistry strategy, we have generated LY2811376 [(S)-4-(2,4-difluoro-5-pyrimidin-5-yl-phenyl)-4-methyl-5,6-dihydro-4H-[1,3]thiazin-2-ylamine], the first orally available non-peptidic BACE1 inhibitor that produces profound Aβ-lowering effects in animals. The biomarker changes obtained in preclinical animal models translate into man at doses of LY2811376 that were safe and well tolerated in healthy volunteers. Prominent and long-lasting Aβ reductions in lumbar CSF were measured after oral dosing of 30 or 90 mg of LY2811376. This represents the first translation of BACE1-driven biomarker changes in CNS from preclinical animal models to man. Because of toxicology findings identified in longer-term preclinical studies, this compound is no longer progressing in clinical development. However, BACE1 remains a viable target because the adverse effects reported here were recapitulated in LY2811376-treated BACE1 KO mice and thus are unrelated to BACE1 inhibition. The magnitude and duration of central Aβ reduction obtainable with BACE1 inhibition positions this protease as a tractable small-molecule target through which to test the amyloid hypothesis in man.","1529-2401","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","(31) 16507-16",2011,"Patrick C","May","PC","Lilly Research Laboratories, Eli Lilly & Co., Indianapolis, Indiana 46285, USA."

In this paper, we show that hemizygous deletion of Vps35 in the Tg2576 mouse model of AD led to earlier-onset AD-like phenotypes, including cognitive memory deficits, defective long-term potentiation, and impaired postsynaptic glutamatergic neurotransmission in young adult age. These deficits correlated well with an increase of β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) level in the mutant hippocampus. We further demonstrate that VPS35 is predominantly expressed in pyramidal neurons of young adult hippocampus and interacts with BACE1, a protease responsible for Aβ production. Loss of VPS35 function in the mouse hippocampus increased BACE1 activity. Suppression of VPS35 expression in culture decreased BACE1 trans-Golgi localization but enriched it in endosomes. These results demonstrate an essential role for VPS35 in suppression of AD neuropathology and in inhibition of BACE1 activation and Aβ production by promoting BACE1 endosome-to-Golgi retrieval.","1540-8140","The Journal of cell biology","(195) 765-79",2011,"Lei","Wen","L","Institute of Molecular Medicine and Genetics, Medical College of Georgia, Georgia Health Sciences University, Augusta, GA 30912, USA."

We found that obovatol dose-dependently attenuates LPS-induced memory deficit in the Morris water maze and passive avoidance tasks.

The LPS-mediated neuroinflammation as determined by Western blots and immunostainings was significantly ameliorated by the compound. Furthermore, LPS-induced nuclear factor (NF)-κB DNA binding activity was drastically abolished by obovatol as shown by the electrophoretic mobility shift assay. The anti-neuroinflammation and anti-amyloidogenesis by obovatol were replicated in in vitro studies.

In the present study, the effect of total alkaloidal extract from M. koenigii leaves (MKA) on cognitive functions and brain cholinesterase activity in mice were determined. In vitro β-secretase 1 (BACE1) inhibitory activity was also evaluated. The total alkaloidal extract was administered orally in three doses (10, 20 and 30 mg/kg) for 15 days to different groups of young and aged mice.

A high plasma level of homocysteine, acting as a potent methyltransferase inhibitor, is assumed to be a risk factor for AD onset. Using the demethylating drug 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza), we tested whether and how BACE1 expression is regulated in mouse BV-2 microglial cells. 5-Aza increased both BACE1 mRNA and protein levels in a dose-dependent manner. Bisulfite-sequencing analysis revealed that two CpG sites at positions +298 and +351 in the 5'-untranslated region (5'-UTR) of the BACE1 gene were specifically demethylated in BV-2 cells treated with 5-Aza. In silico analysis showed that the +351 site is the STAT3/CTCF-binding site; the function of the +298 site has not been identified. To assess whether these two CpG sites play an important role in 5-Aza-induced transcriptional activation of BACE1, we constructed a BACE1 gene promoter including the 5'-UTR (-1136 to +500) fused to a CpG-free luciferase gene (pCpGL-BACE1) and its mutant pCpGL-BACE1-AA, which has substituted CG dinucleotides at the two CpG sites of pCpGL-BACE1 to AA. Promoter analysis showed a significant decrease (∼30%) in the activity of pCpGL-BACE1-AA compared with that of pCpGL-BACE1. Furthermore, in vitro methylation of these two reporter constructs showed a complete silencing of their promoter activities. Our data demonstrate that BACE1 gene expression is regulated by DNA methylation of at least two CpG sites at positions +298 and +351 in the 5'-UTR in BV-2 microglial cells.","1090-2104","Biochemical and biophysical research communications","(417) 387-92",2012,"Catherine Jeonghae","Byun","CJ","Department of Molecular Medicine, Ewha Womans University Medical School, Seoul, South Korea."
22166376,"Ginsenoside Rg1 attenuates β-amyloid generation via suppressing PPARγ-regulated BACE1 activity in N2a-APP695 cells.","The level of β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) has been documented to increase in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease, which has resulted in elevation of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptides. As a transcription factor binding site of the BACE1 promoter, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) response element regulates the activity of the BACE1 promoter activity, indicating that PPARγ may become a potential target for Alzheimer's disease treatment. Recent studies have demonstrated that ginsenoside Rg1 which is an effective component of extracts of ginseng can prevent memory loss and improve cognitive function in a variety of animal models. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, we found that Rg1 decreased the levels of Aβ₁₋₄₀ and Aβ₁₋₄₂ secreted in N2a-APP695 cells. The expression levels of both BACE1 mRNA and protein as well as β-CTFs, a cleavaged C-terminal fragment of APP by BACE1, were reduced in cells treated with Rg1. Moreover, Rg1 treatment led to a translocation of PPARγ from cytoplasm to nuclear. Intriguingly, Rg1, like pioglitazone (a PPARγ agonist), suppressed BACE1 activity in N2a-APP695 cells, while its effect on BACE1 activity was attenuated by GW9662 (a PPARγ antagonist). These results indicate that Rg1 may be a PPARγ agonist to enhance the binding of nuclear PPARγ to the BACE1 promoter, which may in turn inhibit the transcription and translation of BACE1, suppress the activity of BACE1, and ultimately attenuate Aβ generation. Therefore, ginsenoside Rg1 may serve as a promising agent in modulating Aβ-related pathology in Alzheimer's disease.","1879-0712","European journal of pharmacology","(675) 15-21",2012,"Li-Min","Chen","LM","Department of Neurology, Fujian Institute of Geriatrics, the Affiliated Union Hospital of Fujian Medical University, People's Republic of China."
22171895,"Β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 trafficking and Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis.","β-Site APP-cleaving enzyme (BACE1) cleaves the amyloid precursor protein (APP) at the β-secretase site to initiate the production of Aβ peptides. These accumulate to form toxic oligomers and the amyloid plaques associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD). An increase of BACE1 levels in the brain of AD patients has been mostly attributed to alterations of its intracellular trafficking. Golgi-associated adaptor proteins, GGA sort BACE1 for export to the endosomal compartment, which is the major cellular site of BACE1 activity. BACE1 undergoes recycling between endosome, trans-Golgi network (TGN), and the plasma membrane, from where it is endocytosed and either further recycled or retrieved to the endosome. Phosphorylation of Ser498 facilitates BACE1 recognition by GGA1 for retrieval to the endosome. Ubiquitination of BACE1 C-terminal Lys501 signals GGA3 for exporting BACE1 to the lysosome for degradation. In addition, the retromer mediates the retrograde transport of BACE1 from endosome to TGN. Decreased levels of GGA proteins and increased levels of retromer-associated sortilin have been associated with AD. Both would promote the co-localization of BACE1 and the amyloid precursor protein in the TGN and endosomes. Decreased levels of GGA3 also impair BACE1 degradation. Further understanding of BACE1 trafficking and its regulation may offer new therapeutic approaches for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.","1471-4159","Journal of neurochemistry","(120) 869-80",2012,"Jiangli","Tan","J","Department of Pathology, and Mental Health Research Institute, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Australia."

To develop lower weight BACE1 inhibitors, a series of tripeptidic BACE1 inhibitors were devised using a design approach based on the conformation of a virtual inhibitor bound to the BACE1 active site, also called 'in-silico conformational structure-based design'. Although these tripeptidic BACE1 inhibitors contained some natural amino acid residues, they are expected to be useful as lead compounds for developing the next generation BACE1 inhibitors, due to their low molecular size and unique structural features compared with previously reported inhibitors.","1464-3405","Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry letters","(22) 1130-5",2012,"Yoshio","Hamada","Y","Faculty of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Kobe Gakuin University, Minatojima, Chuo-ku, Kobe 650-8586, Japan; Center for Frontier Research in Medicinal Science, Kyoto Pharmaceutical University, Yamashina-ku, Kyoto 607-8412, Japan."

The results showed the expression of BACE1, one of the potential functional downstream targets of miR-124, was well correlated with cell death induced by Aβ neurotoxicity, and its expression level could be up- and down-regulated by suppression or over expression of miR-124 level respectively. These findings suggest that miR-124 may work as a basilic regulating factor to alleviate cell death in the process of AD by targeting BACE1, play an essential role in the control of BACE1 gene expression, and might be considered as a novel therapeutic target in treating AD.","1879-3169","Toxicology letters","(209) 94-105",2012,"Marong","Fang","M","Institute of Anatomy and Cell Biology, Medical College, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China."

Thus, BACE1 represents a key target protein in the development of new potential drugs to treat Alzheimer's disease. We aimed to develop a tomato-derived recombinant BACE1 (rBACE1) protein to serve as a vaccine antigen that would promote an immune response. We utilized a plant expression cassette, pE8BACE, to optimize BACE1 expression in tomato fruits. Polyemerase chain reaction and Southern blot analyses verified integration of the BACE1 gene into the plant genome. Northern and Western blot analyses demonstrated successful mRNA and protein expression of rBACE1, respectively; the Sensizyme assay kit estimated the expression level of rBACE1 protein at 136 ± 7 ng mg⁻¹ total soluble protein. The tomato-derived rBACE1 retains its activity for a long storage period at cool or room temperature, and is highly resistant to degradation in conditions such as low acidity. Tomato-derived rBACE1 was severely degraded by heat or boiling.

Double-transgenic APP/PS1 mice express altered APP and PS1 mRNAs and proteins, reduced β-secretase 1 (BACE1) mRNA and normal BACE1 protein, all of which suggest a particular mechanism of amyloidogenesis when compared with sporadic AD.

Amyloid deposition in plaques is accompanied by altered mitochondria and increased oxidative damage, post-translational modifications and accumulation of altered proteins at the dystrophic neurites surrounding plaques. Degradation pathways are also modified with disease progression including activation of the immunoproteasome together with variable alterations of the different protease activities of the ubiquitin-proteasome system.

22194329,"Flexibility of the flap in the active site of BACE1 as revealed by crystal structures and molecular dynamics simulations.","β-Secretase (β-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1; BACE1) is a transmembrane aspartic protease that cleaves the β-amyloid precursor protein en route to generation of the amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) that is believed to be responsible for the Alzheimer's disease amyloid cascade. It is thus a prime target for the development of inhibitors which may serve as drugs in the treatment and/or prevention of Alzheimer's disease. In the following determination of the crystal structures of both apo and complexed BACE1, structural analysis of all crystal structures of BACE1 deposited in the PDB and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of monomeric and `dimeric' BACE1 were used to study conformational changes in the active-site region of the enzyme. It was observed that a flap able to cover the active site is the most flexible region, adopting multiple conformational states in the various crystal structures. Both the presence or absence of an inhibitor within the active site and the crystal packing are shown to influence the flap's conformation. An open conformation of the flap is mostly observed in the apo structures, while direct hydrogen-bonding interaction between main-chain atoms of the flap and the inhibitor is a prerequisite for the flap to adopt a closed conformation in the crystal structures of complexes. Thus, a systematic study of the conformational flexibility of the enzyme may not only contribute to structure-based drug design of BACE1 inhibitors and of other targets with flexible conformations, but may also help to better understand the mechanistic events associated with the binding of substrates and inhibitors to the enzyme.","1399-0047","Acta crystallographica.

We have shown anti-inflammatory and neurotrophic properties of obovatol, a biphenolic compound isolated from Magnolia obovata. In this study, we examined the effect of obovatol on cognitive deficits in two separate AD models: (i) mice that received intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusion of Aβ(1-42) (2.0 μg/mouse) and (ii) Tg2576 mice-expressing mutant human amyloid precursor protein (K670N, M671L). Injection of Aβ(1-42) into lateral ventricle caused memory impairments in the Morris water maze and passive avoidance tasks, being associated with neuroinflammation. Aβ(1-42) -induced abnormality was significantly attenuated by administration of obovatol. When we analyzed with Tg2576 mice, long-term treatment of obovatol (1 mg/kg/day for 3 months) significantly improved cognitive function. In parallel with the improvement, treatment suppressed astroglial activation, BACE1 expression and NF-κB activity in the transgenic mice. Furthermore, obovatol potently inhibited fibrillation of Aβin vitro in a dose-dependent manner, as determined by Thioflavin T fluorescence and electron microscopic analysis. In conclusion, our data demonstrated that obovatol prevented memory impairments in experimental AD models, which could be attributable to amelioration of neuroinflammation and amyloidogenesis by inhibition of NF-κB signaling pathway and anti-fibrillogenic activity of obovatol.","1471-4159","Journal of neurochemistry","(120) 1048-59",2012,"Dong-Young","Choi","DY","College of Pharmacy and MRC, Chungbuk National University, Heungduk-gu, Cheongju, Chungbuk, South Korea."

Beta-site amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is the β-secretase in vivo essential for generation of Aβ. Previously we demonstrated that BACE1 is ubiquitinated and the degradation of BACE1 is mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway (UPP). However the mechanism underlying regulation of BACE1 degradation by UPP remains elusive. Ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1) is a deubiquitinating enzyme highly specific to neuron, catalyzing the hydrolysis of ubiquitin conjugates from ubiquitinated substrates. UCHL1 regulates ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation. However, whether UCHL1 is particularly involved in the proteasomal degradation of BACE1 and what is the role of UCHL1 in AD pathogenesis remain elusive. To investigate the effect of UCHL1 on BACE1 degradation, HUCH cells, a UCHL1 stably over-expressed HEK293 cell line, was established. We found that inhibition of UCHL1 significantly increased BACE1 protein level in a time-dependent manner. Half life of BACE1 was reduced in HUCH cells compared with HEK. Over-expression of UCHL1 decreased APP C-terminal fragment C99 and Aβ levels in HUCH cells. Moreover, disruption of Uchl1 gene significantly elevated levels of endogenous BACE1, C99 and Aβ in the Uchl1-null gad mice. These results demonstrated that UCHL1 accelerates BACE1 degradation and affects APP processing and Aβ production. This study suggests that potentiation of UCHL1 might be able to reduce the level of BACE1 and Aβ in brain, which makes it a novel target for AD drug development.","1471-4159","Journal of neurochemistry","(120) 1129-38",2012,"Mingming","Zhang","M","Townsend Family Laboratories, Department of Psychiatry, Brain Research Center, Graduate Program in Neuroscience, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada."

We previously demonstrated that hyperhomocysteinemia and DNA hypomethylation induced by B vitamin deficiency are associated with PSEN1 and BACE1 overexpression and amyloid production. The present study is aimed at assessing S-adenosylmethionine effects in mice kept under a condition of B vitamin deficiency. To this end, TgCRND8 mice and wild-type littermates were assigned to control or B vitamin deficient diet, with or without S-adenosylmethionine supplementation.

Furthermore, S-adenosylmethionine treatment reduced plaque spreading independently on B vitamin deficiency. These results strengthen our previous observations on the possible role of one-carbon metabolism in Alzheimer's disease, highlighting hyperhomocysteinemia-related mechanisms in dementia onset/progression and encourage further studies aimed at evaluating the use of S-adenosylmethionine as a potential candidate drug for the treatment of the disease.","1558-1497","Neurobiology of aging","(33) 1482.e1-16",2012,"Andrea","Fuso","A","Department of Surgery P.

BACE1 levels are increased in AD, potentially accelerating Aβ generation, but the mechanisms of BACE1 elevation are not fully understood. Cdk5/p25 has been implicated in neurodegeneration and BACE1 regulation, suggesting therapeutic Cdk5 inhibition for AD. In addition, caspase 3 has been implicated in BACE1 elevation. Here, we show that the Cdk5 level and p25:p35 ratio were elevated and correlated with BACE1 level in brains of AD patients and 5XFAD transgenic mice. Mouse primary cortical neurons treated with Aβ42 oligomers had increased BACE1 level and p25:p35 ratio. Surprisingly, the Aβ42-induced BACE1 elevation was not blocked by Cdk5 inhibitors CP68130 and roscovitine, and instead the BACE1 level was increased greater than with Aβ42 treatment alone. Moreover, Cdk5 inhibitors alone elevated BACE1 in a time- and dose-dependent manner that coincided with increased caspase 3 cleavage and decreased Cdk5 level. Caspase 3 inhibitor benzyloxycarbonyl-VAD failed to prevent the Aβ42-induced BACE1 increase. Further experiments suggested that the Aβ42-induced BACE1 elevation was the result of a post-transcriptional mechanism. We conclude that Aβ42 may increase the BACE1 level independently of either Cdk5 or caspase 3 and that Cdk5 inhibition for AD may cause BACE1 elevation, a potentially negative therapeutic outcome.","1083-351X","The Journal of biological chemistry","(287) 7224-35",2012,"Katherine R","Sadleir","KR","Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois 60611, USA."

We previously reported that the scaffolding protein RanBP9 is markedly increased in AD brains and promotes Aβ generation by scaffolding APP/BACE1/LRP complexes together and accelerating APP endocytosis. Because APP, LRP, and RanBP9 all physically interact with β-integrins, we investigated whether RanBP9 alters integrin-dependent cell adhesion and focal adhesion signaling. Here, we show that RanBP9 overexpression dramatically disrupts integrin-dependent cell attachment and spreading in NIH3T3 and hippocampus-derived HT22 cells, concomitant with strongly decreased Pyk2/paxillin signaling and talin/vinculin localization in focal adhesion complexes. Conversely, RanBP9 knockdown robustly promotes cell attachment, spreading, and focal adhesion signaling and assembly. Cell surface biotinylation and endocytosis assays reveal that RanBP9 overexpression and RanBP9 siRNA potently reduces and increases surface β1-integrin and LRP by accelerating and inhibiting their endocytosis, respectively. Primary hippocampal neurons derived from RanBP9-transgenic mice also demonstrate severely reduced levels of surface β1-integrin, LRP, and APP, as well as neurite arborization. Therefore, these data indicate that RanBP9 simultaneously inhibits cell-adhesive processes and enhances Aβ generation by accelerating APP, LRP, and β1-integrin endocytosis.","1530-6860","FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology","(26) 1672-81",2012,"Jung A","Woo","JA","World Class University-Neurocytomics Program, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea."

BACE1-IR increased in the CA3 mossy fiber field and dentate inner molecular layer in pilocarpine-induced epileptic mice, relative to controls (saline-treated mice and mice 24-48 h after pilocarpine-status), and paralleled aberrant expression of neuropeptide Y.

However, whether oral administration of CQ reduces zinc accumulation in Aβ plaques and inhibits the amyloidogenic pathway have not been properly established in AD transgenic mice.

In addition to AβPP, the preponderance of genes that were reprogrammed was rich in CpG dinucleotides implicating DNA methylation and chromatin restructuring in their regulation. To examine the involvement of epigenetic intermediates in Pb-induced alterations in gene expression, differentiated SH-SY5Y cells were exposed to a series of Pb concentrations (5-100 μM) for 48 h and were analyzed for the protein expression of AβPP, β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), specificity protein 1 and 3 (Sp1, Sp3) and epigenetic intermediates like DNA methyltransferase 1, 3a (Dnmt1, Dnmt3a) and methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) involved in DNA methylation six days after the exposure had ceased.

RT-PCR analysis of Dnmt1, Dnmt3a and MeCP2 indicated a significant down-regulation of the mRNA levels. These data suggest that Pb interferes with DNA methylating capacity in these cells, thus altering the expression of AD-related genes.","1875-5828","Current Alzheimer research","(9) 555-62",2012,"Syed Waseem","Bihaqi","SW","Department of Biomedical & Pharmaceutical Sciences, Interdisciplinary Neuroscience Program, University of Rhode Island, Kingston, RI 02881, USA."

Accumulating evidence in AD research suggests that alterations in the microRNA (miRNA) network could contribute to risk for the disease. miRNAs are conserved small non-coding RNAs that control gene expression at the posttranscriptional level and are essential for neuronal function and survival. The results from recent profiling experiments in humans suggest that a number of specific miRNAs are misregulated in disease conditions, several of which have been implicated in the regulation of key genes involved in AD, including APP, BACE1 and MAPT. Moreover, rare disease-specific polymorphisms have been identified in known and putative miRNA target sites located within the 3'untranslated regions (3'UTRs) of APP and BACE1 genes. Here, we review current findings regarding miRNA research in humans and various cellular and animal models to provide a strong basis for future research aimed at understanding the potential contribution of miRNAs to AD pathophysiology.","1095-953X","Neurobiology of disease","(46) 285-90",2012,"Charlotte","Delay","C","Centre de Recherche du CHUQ, Axe Neurosciences, Quebec City, Quebec, Canada G1V4G2."

To confirm the physiological/ pathological significance of this phenotype in vivo, we successfully generated transgenic mice overexpressing RanBP9 as well as RanBP9-null mice. Here we show that RanBP9 overexpression resulted in >2-fold increase in Aβ40 levels as early as 4 mo of age. A sustained increase in Aβ40 levels was seen at 12 mo of age in both CHAPS-soluble and formic acid (FA)-soluble brain fractions. In addition, Aβ42 levels were also significantly increased in FA-soluble fractions at 12 mo of age. More important, increased Aβ levels were translated to increased deposition of amyloid plaques. In addition, RanBP9 overexpression significantly decreased the levels of synaptophysin and PSD-95 proteins. Conversely, RanBP9-null mice showed increased levels of synaptophysin, PSD-95, and drebrin A protein levels. Given that loss of synapses is the best pathological correlate of cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD), increased Aβ levels by RanBP9 observed in the present study provides compelling evidence that RanBP9 may indeed play a key role in the etiology of AD. If so, RanBP9 provides a great opportunity to develop novel therapy for AD.","1530-6860","FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology","(26) 2072-83",2012,"Madepalli K","Lakshmana","MK","Section of Neurobiology, Torrey Pines Institute for Molecular Studies, Port Saint Lucie, Florida, USA. mlakshmana@tpims.org"

Aβ is generated through proteolysis of β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) by two proteases: β-secretase and γ-secretase. BACE1, the β-secretase in vivo and the key rate-limiting enzyme that initiates the formation of Aβ, is an attractive drug target for AD therapy. Our previous study demonstrated that BACE1 is ubiquitinated and its degradation and effect on APP cleaving process are mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. However, the specific underlying mechanism is still not well defined. In present study, we determined the specific binding sites responsible for the proteasomal degradation of BACE1. Ten fragments of human BACE1 cDNA with each of them containing 1 to 3 Lys codons were cloned, and HEK293 cells transfected with these recombinant plasmids were treated with specific proteasome inhibitor lactacystin. The protein levels of fragment-3 (Pro(149)-Leu(180)), -4 (IIe(179)-Ser(230)) and -8 (Met(349)-Arg(400)) were significantly increased by lactacystin treatment, and immunocytochemical staining results showed that fragment-3, -4 and -8 proteins were colocalized with ubiquitin. Site-directed mutagenesis at Lys(203) and Lys(382) of BACE1 abolished the proteasomal degradation of BACE1 and affected APP processing at β site and Aβ production. Taken together, our study demonstrated that BACE1 Lys(203) and Lys(382) are essential for its proteasomal degradation, and the results may advance our understanding of regulation of BACE1 and APP processing by the ubiquitin proteasome system in AD pathogenesis and shed new insights on its pharmaceutical potential.","1875-5828","Current Alzheimer research","(9) 606-15",2012,"Rong","Wang","R","School of Life Science and Technology, Beijing Institute of Technology, Haidian District, Beijing 100081, China."

We identified a G-rich sequence within exon 3 of BACE1 involved in controlling splice site selection. Mutation of the G-rich sequence decreased use of the normal 5' splice site of exon 3, which leads to full-length and proteolytically active BACE1, and increased use of an alternative splice site, which leads to a shorter, essentially inactive isoform. Nuclease protection assays, nuclear magnetic resonance, and circular dichroism spectroscopy revealed that this sequence folds into a G-quadruplex structure. Several proteins were identified as capable of binding to the G-rich sequence, and one of these, heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H, was found to regulate BACE1 exon 3 alternative splicing and in a manner dependent on the G-rich sequence. Knockdown of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein H led to a decrease in the full-length BACE1 mRNA isoform as well as a decrease in Aβ production from APP, suggesting new possibilities for therapeutic approaches to Alzheimer's disease.","1471-4159","Journal of neurochemistry","(121) 763-73",2012,"Jean-François","Fisette","JF","Center for Neurologic Diseases, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."

Oxidative stress (OS) that leads to metabolic dysfunction and apoptosis of neurons in AD enhances BACE1 expression and activity. The activation of c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway was proposed to explain the BACE1 mRNA increase under OS. However, little is known about the translational control of BACE1 in OS. Recently, a post-transcriptional increase of BACE1 level controlled by phosphorylation of eIF2α (eukaryotic translation initiation factor-2α) have been described after energy deprivation. PKR (double-stranded RNA dependant protein kinase) is a pro-apoptotic kinase that phosphorylates eIF2α and modulates JNK activation in various cellular stresses. We investigated the relations between PKR, eIF2α and BACE1 in AD brains in APP/PS1 knock-in mice and in hydrogen peroxide-induced OS in human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cell cultures. Immunoblotting results showed that activated PKR (pPKR) and activated eIF2α (peIF2α) and BACE1 levels are increased in AD cortices and BACE1 correlate with phosphorylated eIF2α levels. BACE1 protein levels are increased in response to OS in SH-SY5Y cells and specific inhibitions of PKR-eIF2α attenuate BACE1 protein levels in this model.

22325686,"Modulation of in vitro activity of zymogenic and mature recombinant human β-secretase by dietary plants.","The in vitro activity of human recombinant β-secretase (BACE1) was studied using a fluorogenic substrate based on the cleavage site for the enzyme in the Swedish mutation of amyloid precursor protein. The enzyme was inhibited by a control peptide inhibitor with good repeatability. The enzyme preparation comprised a mixture of pro-enzyme or zymogen and mature enzyme whereby the pro-enzyme sequence forms a 'flap' that can obstruct the binding site. 'Open flap' forms of the zymogen and mature enzyme are active, but the 'closed flap' form of the zymogen is inactive. This mixture of enzyme populations permitted apparent stimulation of enzyme activity under particular conditions, presumably due to facilitating flap-opening of the zymogen. As reported for heparin, enzyme activation was stimulated in the presence of low concentrations of Tween 20 and dimethylsulfoxide before becoming inhibited at higher concentrations. Dietary plant extracts either consistently inhibited (e.g. clove, tea, cinammon) or consistently stimulated (e.g. mushroom, parsley, asparagus) BACE1. Common structural features identified by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy revealed that BACE1 activity could be explained by differential interactions of either small molecule or polymeric species with mature versus zymogen forms of the enzyme, respectively. Further, enzyme activity could be reversed by mixtures of high and low mass species. These results may have implications for the regulation of β-secretase activity in vivo by either endogenous or possibly dietary factors and for a potential role of BACE1 in stimulation of the production of amyloid beta peptide in sporadic Alzheimer's disease.","1742-4658","The FEBS journal","(279) 1291-305",2012,"Paul","Sheean","P","CSIRO Food and Nutritional Sciences, Werribee, Australia."

Indeed, the toxic Aβ(42) aggregates constituting senile plaques, one of AD hallmarks, is often detected as amorphous material or fine fibrils in the brain capillary of AD patients. Aβ(42) causing cerebral microangiopathy might originate either from the circulating blood, the vessel wall itself or the brain parenchyma. In the present investigation we show, for the first time, that in rat brain capillary endothelial cells (RBE4), in vitro oxygen glucose deprivation treatment elicits 250% of Aβ(42) peptide production increase through a mechanism that involves the hypoxia inducible factor-1-mediated β-secretase (BACE1) up-regulation. Furthermore, we observed a time dependent increase of amyloid protein precursor (AβPP) gene and protein expression, confirming previous reports which established the existence of AβPP in the cerebrovascular domain. Our experimental evidences point out that ischemic events may directly contribute in brain capillary endothelial cells to the enhancement of the amyloidogenic metabolism, leading to intracellular deposition of Aβ(42). This events may contribute to the impairment of Aβ brain clearance and AD related blood brain barrier dysfunctions.","1095-9327","Molecular and cellular neurosciences","(49) 415-22",2012,"Alessandra","Bulbarelli","A","Department of Experimental Medicine, University of Milano-Bicocca via Cadore 48, 20900 Monza, MI, Italy. alessandra.bulbarelli@unimib.it"

Besides the expected reductions in Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42, treatment also changed the relative levels of several other Aβ isoforms. In particular Aβ1-34 decreased, while Aβ5-40 increased, and these changes were more sensitive to BACE1 inhibition than the changes in Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42. The effects on Aβ5-40 indicate the presence of a BACE1 independent pathway of APP degradation.

One such target is β-secretase which, in most AD patients, cleaves the wild-type (WT) β-secretase site sequence of the amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP) to produce neurotoxic amyloid-β (Aβ). Thus, an animal model representing most AD patients for evaluating β-secretase effects on memory deficits is one that expresses human AβPP containing the WT β-secretase site sequence. BACE1 and cathepsin B (CatB) proteases have β-secretase activity, but gene knockout studies have not yet validated that the absence of these proteases improves memory deficits in such an animal model. This study assessed the effects of deleting these protease genes on memory deficits in the AD mouse model expressing human AβPP containing the WT β-secretase site sequence and the London γ-secretase site (AβPPWT/Lon mice). Knockout of the CatB gene in the AβPPWT/Lon mice improved memory deficits and altered the pattern of Aβ-related biomarkers in a manner consistent with CatB having WT β-secretase activity. But deletion of the BACE1 gene had no effect on these parameters in the AβPPWT/Lon mice. These data are the first to show that knockout of a putative β-secretase gene results in improved memory in an AD animal model expressing the WT β-secretase site sequence of AβPP, present in the majority of AD patients.

Aβ is generated from amyloid precursor protein (APP) through sequential cleavages by BACE1 (the major β-secretase in the brain) and γ-secretase. The purpose of this study was to characterize APP metabolism in vivo in AD patients versus cognitively healthy subjects by examining alterations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers. We measured BACE1 activity and concentrations of α- and β-cleaved soluble APP (sAPPα and sAPPβ, respectively) and Aβ40 in CSF, biomarkers that all reflect the metabolism of APP, in 75 AD patients and 65 cognitively healthy controls. These analytes were also applied in a multivariate model to determine whether they provided any added diagnostic value to the core CSF AD biomarkers Aβ42, T-tau, and P-tau. We found no significant differences in BACE1 activity or sAPPα, sAPPβ, and Aβ40 concentrations between AD patients and controls. A multivariate model created with all analytes did not improve the separation of AD patients from controls compared with using the core AD biomarkers alone, highlighting the strong diagnostic performance of Aβ42, T-tau, and P-tau for AD. However, AD patients in advanced clinical stage, as determined by low MMSE score (≤20), had lower BACE1 activity and sAPPα, sAPPβ, and Aβ40 concentrations than patients with higher MMSE score, suggesting that these markers may be related to the severity of the disease.","1559-1174","Neuromolecular medicine","(14) 65-73",2012,"Christoffer","Rosén","C","Clinical Neurochemistry Laboratory, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, The Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg, Mölndal, Sweden."

Aβ is derived from the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) through sequential cleavages by β- and γ-secretases, and the production of Aβ is greatly affected by the subcellular localization of these factors. CUTA, the mammalian CutA divalent cation tolerance homolog (E. coli), has been proposed to mediate acetylcholinesterase activity and copper homeostasis, which are important in Alzheimer disease pathology. However, the exact function of CUTA remains largely unclear. Here we show that human CUTA has several variants that differ in their N-terminal length and are separated as heavy (H) and light (L) components. The H component has the longest N terminus and is membrane-associated, whereas the L component is N-terminally truncated at various sites and localized in the cytosol. Importantly, we demonstrate that the H component of CUTA interacts through its N terminus with the transmembrane domain of β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), the putative β-secretase, mainly in the Golgi/trans-Golgi network. Overexpression and RNA interference knockdown of CUTA can reduce and increase BACE1-mediated APP processing/Aβ secretion, respectively. RNA interference of CUTA decelerates intracellular trafficking of BACE1 from the Golgi/trans-Golgi network to the cell surface and reduces the steady-state level of cell surface BACE1. Our results identify the H component of CUTA as a novel BACE1-interacting protein that mediates the intracellular trafficking of BACE1 and the processing of APP to Aβ.","1083-351X","The Journal of biological chemistry","(287) 11141-50",2012,"Yingjun","Zhao","Y","Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Neurodegenerative Disease and Aging Research, College of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian 361005, China."

The BACE1 protein resides predominantly in proximal segment and the termini of OSN axons, and the expression of BACE1 inversely correlates with odor-evoked neural activity. The precision of targeting of OSN axons is disturbed in both BACE1 null and, surprisingly, in BACE1 heterozygous mice.

In addition, the APP intracellular domain (AICD), which acts as a transcriptional regulator, has been reported to control the expression of PrP(C). Through the use of transgenic mice, cell culture models and manipulation of APP expression and processing, this study aimed to clarify the role of AICD in regulating PrP(C). Over-expression of the three major isoforms of human APP (APP(695), APP(751) and APP(770)) in cultured neuronal and non-neuronal cells had no effect on the level of endogenous PrP(C). Furthermore, analysis of brain tissue from transgenic mice over-expressing either wild type or familial AD associated mutant human APP revealed unaltered PrP(C) levels. Knockdown of endogenous APP expression in cells by siRNA or inhibition of γ-secretase activity also had no effect on PrP(C) levels. Overall, we did not detect any significant difference in the expression of PrP(C) in any of the cell or animal-based paradigms considered, indicating that the control of cellular PrP(C) levels by AICD is not as straightforward as previously suggested.","1932-6203","PloS one","(7) e31754",2012,"Victoria","Lewis","V","Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Faculty of Biological Sciences, University of Leeds, Leeds, United Kingdom."

The culture filtrate of 9k-B22 was concentrated, and then purified by HisTrap affinity column. The purified proteins, showing good BACE1 protease activity, were found to be a mixture of glycoproteins because they can be stained by periodic acid-Schiff reagent. After this mixture was treated with Endo H(f) (a recombinant protein of endoglycosidase H), we found two new adjacent bands around 50 kDa on SDS-PAGE. These two bands were cut and subjected to peptide mass fingerprint analysis, and identified as proBACE1 and BACE1 proteins. Enzyme assays revealed that the activities of both BACE1 proteins in glycosylated and deglycosylated form were lower than that of commercial BACE1 (expressed in HEK-293), inferring glycosylation and the type of glycosylation are crucial to the activity. However, we found no apparent difference in the inhibition of those all above three enzyme forms by one known BACE1 inhibitor. This observation demonstrated that the glycosylation of BACE1 by Pichia pastoris does not affect its interaction with this inhibitor. After optimization of culture conditions, the production of BACE1 in Pichia pastoris was enhanced to about 1 mg/L.

Thus far, activity cliffs have predominantly been defined on the basis of molecular graph or fingerprint representations. Herein we introduce 3D activity cliffs derived from comparisons of experimentally determined compound binding modes. The analysis of 3D activity cliffs is generally applicable to target proteins for which structures of multiple ligand complexes are available. For two popular targets, β-secretase 1 (BACE1) and factor Xa (FXa), public domain X-ray structures with bound inhibitors were collected. Crystallographic binding modes of inhibitors were systematically compared using a 3D similarity method taking conformational, positional, and atomic property differences into account. In addition, standard 2D similarity relationships were also determined. SAR information associated with individual compounds substantially changed when either bioactive conformations or 2D molecular graphs were used for similarity evaluation. 3D activity cliffs were identified for BACE1 and FXa inhibitor sets and systematically compared to 2D cliffs. It was found that less than 40% of 3D activity cliffs were conserved when 2D similarity was applied. The limited conservation of 3D and 2D cliffs provides further evidence for the strong molecule representation dependence of activity cliffs. Moreover, 3D cliffs represent a new class of activity cliffs that convey SAR information in ways that differ from graph-based similarity measures. In cases where sufficient structural information is available, the comparison of 3D and 2D cliffs is expected to aid in SAR analysis and mapping of critical binding determinants.","1549-960X","Journal of chemical information and modeling","(52) 670-7",2012,"Ye","Hu","Y","Department of Life Science Informatics, B-IT, LIMES Program Unit Chemical Biology and Medicinal Chemistry, Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität, Dahlmannstrasse 2, D-53113 Bonn, Germany."

22403710,"Mechanisms underlying insulin deficiency-induced acceleration of β-amyloidosis in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.","Although evidence is accumulating that diabetes mellitus is an important risk factor for sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD), the mechanisms by which defects in insulin signaling may lead to the acceleration of AD progression remain unclear. In this study, we applied streptozotocin (STZ) to induce experimental diabetes in AD transgenic mice (5XFAD model) and investigated how insulin deficiency affects the β-amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP). Two and half months after 5XFAD mice were treated with STZ (90 mg/kg, i.p., once daily for two consecutive days), they showed significant reductions in brain insulin levels without changes in insulin receptor expression. Concentrations of cerebral amyloid-β peptides (Aβ40 and Aβ42) were significantly increased in STZ-treated 5XFAD mice as compared with vehicle-treated 5XFAD controls. Importantly, STZ-induced insulin deficiency upregulated levels of both β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and full-length APP in 5XFAD mouse brains, which was accompanied by dramatic elevations in the β-cleaved C-terminal fragment (C99). Interestingly, BACE1 mRNA levels were not affected, whereas phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2α, a mechanism proposed to mediate the post-transcriptional upregulation of BACE1, was significantly elevated in STZ-treated 5XFAD mice. Meanwhile, levels of GGA3, an adapter protein responsible for sorting BACE1 to lysosomal degradation, are indistinguishable between STZ- and vehicle-treated 5XFAD mice. Moreover, STZ treatments did not affect levels of Aβ-degrading enzymes such as neprilysin and insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) in 5XFAD brains. Taken together, our findings provide a mechanistic foundation for a link between diabetes and AD by demonstrating that insulin deficiency may change APP processing to favor β-amyloidogenesis via the translational upregulation of BACE1 in combination with elevations in its substrate, APP.","1932-6203","PloS one","(7) e32792",2012,"Latha","Devi","L","Center for Dementia Research, Nathan Kline Institute, Orangeburg, New York, United States of America."
22406440,"Deferiprone reduces amyloid-β and tau phosphorylation levels but not reactive oxygen species generation in hippocampus of rabbits fed a cholesterol-enriched diet.","Accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide and the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein are major hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The causes of AD are not well known but a number of environmental and dietary factors are suggested to increase the risk of developing AD. Additionally, altered metabolism of iron may have a role in the pathogenesis of AD. We have previously demonstrated that cholesterol-enriched diet causes AD-like pathology with iron deposition in rabbit brain. However, the extent to which chelation of iron protects against this pathology has not been determined. In this study, we administered the iron chelator deferiprone in drinking water to rabbits fed with a 2% cholesterol diet for 12 weeks. We found that deferiprone (both at 10 and 50 mg/kg/day) significantly decreased levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 as well as BACE1, the enzyme that initiates cleavage of amyloid-β protein precursor to yield Aβ. Deferiprone also reduced the cholesterol diet-induced increase in phosphorylation of tau but failed to reduce reactive oxygen species generation. While deferiprone treatment was not associated with any change in brain iron levels, it was associated with a significant reduction in plasma iron and cholesterol levels. These results demonstrate that deferiprone confers important protection against hypercholesterolemia-induced AD pathology but the mechanism(s) may involve reduction in plasma iron and cholesterol levels rather than chelation of brain iron. We propose that adding an antioxidant therapy to deferiprone may be necessary to fully protect against cholesterol-enriched diet-induced AD-like pathology.","1875-8908","Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD","(30) 167-82",2012,"Jaya R P","Prasanthi","JR","Department of Pharmacology, Physiology and Therapeutics, University of North Dakota School of Medicine and Health Sciences, Grand Forks, ND 58202, USA."

One hundred fifty-two first-ever stroke patients were recruited within 6-72 h after the onset of symptoms. Blood was drawn within 1 h after admission for determining biomarkers. Cognitive function was assayed 2 weeks after stroke. The patients were divided into four groups: stroke, vascular cognitive impairment with no dementia (VCIND), vascular dementia (VaD), and mixed dementia (MD). Forty healthy subjects were used as controls. The results indicated that lower soluble receptor levels for advanced glycation end products (sRAGE) and higher β-secretase enzyme (BACE1) and neprilysin (NEP) levels were found in the VCIND, VaD, and MD groups. In addition, the percentages of ε3/ε4 genotypes and ε4 alleles in the VCIND, VaD, and MD groups were higher than in the stroke group. Correlation analysis determined that sRAGE, BACE1, and NEP were significantly related to the results of neuropsychological assessments. Logistic regression analysis, however, suggested that only sRAGE and BACE1 changed ahead of cognitive impairment after stroke. In conclusion, only BACE1 and sRAGE, not NEP or APOE genotypes, may be biomarkers diagnosing post-stroke cognitive impairment.","1432-1459","Journal of neurology","(259) 2111-8",2012,"Lai","Qian","L","Department of Neurology, Affiliated Drum Tower Hospital of Nanjing University Medical School, 321 ZhongShan Road, Nanjing, 210008, Jiangsu, People's Republic of China."
22407769,"Inhibitory effects of key compounds isolated from Corni fructus on BACE1 Activity.","Progressive cerebral deposition of Aβ in the brain is a seminal event in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aβ is generated from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by proteolytic processing of β-secretase (BACE1) and γ-secretase. Consequently, BACE1, a key enzyme in the production of Aβ, is a prime target for therapeutic intervention in AD. In the course of screening for natural BACE1 inhibitors from Corni fructus, the ethyl acetate (EtOAc) fraction showed significant inhibitory activity against BACE1. By activity guided purification, three compounds of BACE1 inhibitors p-coumaric acid, gallic acid and ursolic acid were isolated from Corni fructus EtOAc fraction. All isolated compounds suppressed BACE1 in a dose dependent manner. p-Coumaric acid, in particular, exhibited significant inhibitory activity against BACE1 with 9.0 × 10(-5)  m and a K(i) value of 1.9 × 10(-6)  m. Also this compound was non-competitive with a substrate in the Dixon plot, suggesting that it might bind either to the β-secretase subsite or to another regulatory site. All compounds showed no significant attenuation of TACE (α-secretase) and other serine proteases such as chymotrypsin and trypsin, demonstrating that they were relatively selective and specific inhibitors of BACE1. These novel findings suggest that Corni fructus contains biologically active components that may be used to attenuate the progression and/or prevention of Alzheimer's disease.","1099-1573","Phytotherapy research : PTR","(26) 1714-8",2012,"Kumju","Youn","K","Department of Food Science and Nutrition, Dong-A University, 840 Hadan-dong, Saha-gu, Busan, 604-714, Korea."

22449984,"Regulation of amyloid-β production by the prion protein.","Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by the amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), culminating in the accumulation of amyloid-β peptides in the brain. The enzymatic action of the β-secretase, BACE1 is the rate-limiting step in this amyloidogenic processing of APP. BACE1 cleavage of wild-type APP (APPWT) is inhibited by the cellular prion protein (PrP (C) ). Our recent study has revealed the molecular and cellular mechanisms behind this observation by showing that PrP (C)  directly interacts with the pro-domain of BACE1 in the trans-Golgi network (TGN), decreasing the amount of BACE1 at the cell surface and in endosomes where it cleaves APPWT, while increasing BACE1 in the TGN where it preferentially cleaves APP with the Swedish mutation (APPSwe). PrP (C)  deletion in transgenic mice expressing the Swedish and Indiana familial mutations (APPSwe,Ind) failed to affect amyloid-β accumulation, which is explained by the differential subcellular sites of action of BACE1 toward APPWT and APPSwe. This, together with our observation that PrP (C)  is reduced in sporadic but not familial AD brain, suggests that PrP (C)  plays a key protective role against sporadic AD. It also highlights the need for an APPWT transgenic mouse model to understand the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying sporadic AD.","1933-690X","Prion","(6) 217-22",2012,"Heledd H","Griffiths","HH","Faculty of Biological Sciences, Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK."

The level/activity of BACE1 is elevated in sporadic AD and identification of proteins that affect BACE1 is important in AD research. Here we found that M1 Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor (M1 mAChR), an important G protein-coupled receptor involved in cholinergic neuronal activity, can interact with BACE1 and mediate its proteosomal degradation. Moreover, overexpression and downregulation of M1 mAChR can decrease and increase the levels of BACE1, as well as the generation of Aβ, respectively. These findings point to a novel coupling of BACE1 and M1 mAChR in AD and possibly schizophrenia.","1872-7972","Neuroscience letters","(515) 125-30",2012,"Shangtong","Jiang","S","Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Neurodegenerative Disease and Aging Research, College of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian 361005, People's Republic of China."
22455478,"BACE1 dependent neuregulin processing: review.","Neuregulin-1 (NRG1), known also as heregulin, acetylcholine receptor inducing activity (ARIA), glial growth factor (GGF), or sensory and motor neuron derived factor (SMDF), plays essential roles in several developmental processes, and is required also later in life. Many variants of NRG1 are produced via alternative splicing and usage of distinct promoters. All contain an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain, which alone is sufficient to bind and activate the cognate receptors, members of the ErbB family. NRG1 mediated signaling is crucial for cardiogenesis and the development of the mammary gland and ErbB2 (HER2), an orphan co-receptor for NRG1 is the target of the drug Herceptin� (trastuzumab) used for treatment of metastatic breast cancer. In the nervous system, NRG1 controls the early development of subpopulations of neural crest cells. In particular, NRG1 acts as an essential paracrine signaling molecule expressed on the axonal surface, where it signals to Schwann cells throughout development and regulates the thickness of the myelin sheath. NRG1 is required also by other cell types in the nervous system, for instance as an axonal signal released by proprioceptive afferents to induce development of the muscle spindle, and it controls aspects of cortical interneuron development as well as the formation of thalamocortical projections. Work from several laboratories implicates dysregulation of NRG1/ErbB4 signaling in the etiology of schizophrenia. Biochemical studies have shown that the precursor proteins of NRG1 can be released from the membrane through limited proteolysis. In addition, most NRG1 isoforms contain a transmembrane domain, which is processed by γ-secretase after shedding. Thereby the intracellular domain is released into the cytoplasm. Despite this, the importance of NRG1 cleavage for its functions in vivo remained unclear until recently. β- Secretase (β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1, BACE1) was first identified through its function as the rate limiting enzyme of amyloid-β-peptide (Aβ) production. Aβ is the major component of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD). More recently it was shown that Neuregulin-1 is a major physiological substrate of BACE1 during early postnatal development. Mutant mice lacking BACE1 display severe hypomyelination of peripheral nerves similar to that seen in mice lacking NRG1/ErbB signaling in Schwann cells, and a BACE1-dependent activation of NRG1 in the process of peripheral myelination was proposed. Here we summarize the current knowledge about the role of NRG1 proteolysis for ErbB receptor mediated signaling during development and in Alzheimer's disease.","1875-5828","Current Alzheimer research","(9) 178-83",2012,"Daniel","Fleck","D","German Center for Neurodegenertive Diseases & Adolf-Butenandt-Institute, Biochemistry, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, 80336 Munich, Germany."

Using the high pressure liquid chromatography analysis of 8-hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine, we measured oxidative DNA damage in the cerebral cortical tissues from MCAT, AβPP, MCAT/AβPP and WT mice. We found that the AβPP transgenic mice that carried the human MCAT gene lived 5 months longer than did the AβPP mice.

Interestingly, we found significantly increased levels of soluble APPα and CTF83 in the MCAT/AβPP mice, relative to the AβPP mice. These data provide direct evidence that oxidative stress plays a primary role in AD etiopathology and that in MCAT mice express Aβ, MCAT prevents abnormal APP processing, reduces Aβ levels and enhances Aβ-degrading enzymes in mice at different ages, corresponding to different stages of disease progression.

There is compelling evidence that the proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides play critical roles in AD pathogenesis. Due to limited access to human neural tissue, pathogenetic studies have, so far, mostly focused on the heterologous overexpression of mutant human APP in non-human cells. In this study, we show that key steps in proteolytic APP processing are recapitulated in neurons generated from human embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural stem cells (NSC). These human NSC-derived neurons express the neuron-specific APP(695) splice variant, BACE1, and all members of the γ-secretase complex. The human NSC-derived neurons also exhibit a differentiation-dependent increase in Aβ secretion and respond to the pharmacotherapeutic modulation by anti-amyloidogenic compounds, such as γ-secretase inhibitors and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Being highly amenable to genetic modification, human NSCs enable the study of mechanisms caused by disease-associated mutations in human neurons. Interestingly, the AD-associated PS1(L166P) variant revealed a partial loss of γ-secretase function, resulting in the decreased production of endogenous Aβ40 and an increased Aβ42/40 ratio. The PS1(L166P) mutant is also resistant to γ-secretase modulation by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons thus provide experimental access to key steps in AD pathogenesis and can be used to screen pharmaceutical compounds directly in a human neuronal system.","1525-2191","The American journal of pathology","(180) 2404-16",2012,"Philipp","Koch","P","Institute of Reconstructive Neurobiology, LIFE & BRAIN Center, University of Bonn and Hertie Foundation, Bonn, Germany."

Nevertheless, the trafficking routes of the neuronal retromer and the role it plays in APP transport in neuronal processes remain unknown. Here we use hippocampal neuronal cultures to address these issues. Using fluorescence microscopy, we find that Vps35, the core element of the retromer complex, is in dendrites and axons, is enriched in endosomes and trans-Golgi network, and is found in APP-positive vesicles. Next, to identify the role the neuronal retromer plays in cargo transport, we infected hippocampal neurons with a lentivirus expressing shRNA to silence Vps35. By live fluorescence imaging, Vps35 deficiency was found to reduce the frequency, but not the kinetics, of long-range APP transport within neuronal processes. Supporting the interpretation that retromer promotes long-range transport, Vps35 deficiency led to increased APP in the early endosomes, in processes but not the soma. Finally, Vps35 deficiency was associated with increased levels of Aβ, a cleaved product of APP, increased colocalization of APP with its cleaving enzyme BACE1 in processes, and caused an enlargement of early endosomes. Taken together, our studies clarify the function of the neuronal retromer, and suggest specific mechanisms for how retromer dysfunction observed in Alzheimer's disease affects APP transport and processing.","1095-953X","Neurobiology of disease","(47) 126-34",2012,"Akhil","Bhalla","A","The Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain, Department of Neurology, Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, New York NY10032, USA."

Opioid receptors influence the regulation of neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine, norepinephrine, GABA, glutamate, and serotonin which have been implicated in the pathogenesis of AD. Opioid system has a close relation with Aβ generation since dysfunction of opioid receptors retards the endocytosis and degradation of BACE1 and γ-secretase and upregulates BACE1 and γ-secretase, and subsequently, the production of Aβ. Conversely, activation of opioid receptors increases the endocytosis of BACE1 and γ-secretase and downregulates BACE1 and γ-secretase, limiting the production of Aβ. The dysfunction of opioid system (opioid receptors and opioid peptides) may contribute to hyperphosphorylation of tau and neuroinflammation, and accounts for the degeneration of cholinergic neurons and cognitive impairment.

These profiles were further characterized to be most likely abnormal olfactory nerve terminals. Reduced glomerular area was detected in 6-12-month-old 5XFAD mice relative to non-transgenic controls, and in aged humans relative to young/adult controls, more robust in AD than aged subjects without cerebral amyloid and tau pathologies. The results suggest that olfactory nerve terminals may undergo age-related dystrophic and degenerative changes in AD model mice and humans, which are associated with increased labeling for amyloidogenic proteins but not local extracellular Aβ deposition. The identified axon terminal pathology might affect neuronal signal transmission and integration at the first olfactory synaptic relay.","1873-7544","Neuroscience","(215) 160-73",2012,"Y","Cai","Y","Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology, Central South University, Xiangya School of Medicine, Changsha, Hunan 410013, China."

Recent studies suggest that AD is primarily a vascular disorder and copper (Cu) may play an important role in AD pathology. However, the consequences of chronic Cu exposure at the presence of other AD risk factors remain to be clarified. To investigate the effects of chronic Cu intake on cerebral hypoperfusion-induced AD pathology, Sprague-Dawley rats suffered bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (2VO) were administrated with 250 ppm copper-containing water or not. Morris water maze test showed that Cu exposure for 3 months exacerbated cognitive impairment induced by 2VO. Elevated amyloid precursor protein (APP) and beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) expression in mRNA and protein levels were also observed in brain of Cu-exposed rats suffered 2VO. In contrast, these Cu-exacerbated changes were ameliorated after Cu was withdrawn from drinking water. In summary, our findings demonstrate that chronic Cu exposure might exacerbate AD pathology in 2VO rats.","1872-7972","Neuroscience letters","(518) 14-8",2012,"Xuexuan","Mao","X","Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou 510006, China."

BACE1 catalyzes the rate-determining step in the generation of Alzheimer amyloid beta peptides and is widely considered as a promising therapeutic target. All the inhibitors were redocked into their corresponding X-ray structures using a combination of eight different protonation states of the Asp dyad for each inhibitor. Five inhibitors were primarily found to favor two different monoprotonated states, and the remaining three favor a dideprotonated state. In addition, five of them exhibited secondary preference for a diprotonated state. These results show that the knowledge of a single protonation state of the Asp dyad is not sufficient to search for the novel inhibitors of BACE1 and the most plausible state for each inhibitor must be determined prior to conducting in-silico screening.","1549-960X","Journal of chemical information and modeling","(52) 1275-87",2012,"Arghya","Barman","A","Department of Chemistry, University of Miami, 1301 Memorial Drive, Coral Gables, Florida 33146, USA."

Biochim Biophys Acta. 1802 (2010) 682-691.). We hypothesized that increased formation of APP-CTFs and Aβ in NPC disease is due to cholesterol-mediated altered endocytic trafficking of APP and/or BACE1. Here, we show that APP endocytosis is prerequisite for enhanced Aβ levels in NPC-cells. Moreover, we observed that NPC cells show cholesterol dependent sequestration and colocalization of APP and BACE1 within enlarged early/recycling endosomes which can lead to increased β-secretase processing of APP. We demonstrated that increased endocytic localization of APP in NPC-cells is likely due to both its increased internalization and its decreased recycling to the cell surface. Our findings suggest that increased cholesterol levels, such as in NPC disease and sporadic AD, may be the upstream effector that drives amyloidogenic APP processing characteristic for Alzheimer's disease by altering endocytic trafficking of APP and BACE1.","0006-3002","Biochimica et biophysica acta","(1822) 1270-83",2012,"Martina","Malnar","M","Division of Molecular Medicine, Rudjer Boskovic Institute, Bijenicka 54, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia."
22553349,"Adaptor protein 2-mediated endocytosis of the β-secretase BACE1 is dispensable for amyloid precursor protein processing.","The β-site amyloid precursor protein (APP)-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is a transmembrane aspartyl protease that catalyzes the proteolytic processing of APP and other plasma membrane protein precursors. BACE1 cycles between the trans-Golgi network (TGN), the plasma membrane, and endosomes by virtue of signals contained within its cytosolic C-terminal domain. One of these signals is the DXXLL-motif sequence DISLL, which controls transport between the TGN and endosomes via interaction with GGA proteins. Here we show that the DISLL sequence is embedded within a longer [DE]XXXL[LI]-motif sequence, DDISLL, which mediates internalization from the plasma membrane by interaction with the clathrin-associated, heterotetrameric adaptor protein 2 (AP-2) complex. Mutation of this signal or knockdown of either AP-2 or clathrin decreases endosomal localization and increases plasma membrane localization of BACE1. Remarkably, internalization-defective BACE1 is able to cleave an APP mutant that itself cannot be delivered to endosomes. The drug brefeldin A reversibly prevents BACE1-catalyzed APP cleavage, ruling out that this reaction occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or ER-Golgi intermediate compartment. Taken together, these observations support the notion that BACE1 is capable of cleaving APP in late compartments of the secretory pathway.","1939-4586","Molecular biology of the cell","(23) 2339-51",2012,"Yogikala","Prabhu","Y","Cell Biology and Metabolism Program, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA."
22583494,"Lithium reduces BACE1 overexpression, β amyloid accumulation, and spatial learning deficits in mice with traumatic brain injury.","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) leads to both acute injury and long-term neurodegeneration, and is a major risk factor for developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). Beta amyloid (Aβ) peptide deposits in the brain are one of the pathological hallmarks of AD. Aβ levels increase after TBI in animal models and in patients with head trauma, and reducing Aβ levels after TBI has beneficial effects. Lithium is known to be neuroprotective in various models of neurodegenerative disease, and can reduce Aβ generation by modulating glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) activity. In this study we explored whether lithium would reduce Aβ load after TBI, and improve learning and memory in a mouse TBI model. Lithium chloride (1.5 mEq/kg, IP) was administered 15 min after TBI, and once daily thereafter for up to 3 weeks. At 3 days after injury, lithium attenuated TBI-induced Aβ load increases, amyloid precursor protein (APP) accumulation, and β-APP-cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE1) overexpression in the corpus callosum and hippocampus. Increased Tau protein phosphorylation in the thalamus was also attenuated after lithium treatment following TBI at the same time point. Notably, lithium treatment significantly improved spatial learning and memory in the Y-maze test conducted 10 days after TBI, and in the Morris water maze test performed 17-20 days post-TBI, in association with increased hippocampal preservation. Thus post-insult treatment with lithium appears to alleviate the TBI-induced Aβ load and consequently improves spatial memory. Our findings suggest that lithium is a potentially useful agent for managing memory impairments after TBI or other head trauma.","1557-9042","Journal of neurotrauma","(29) 2342-51",2012,"Fengshan","Yu","F","Section on Molecular Neurobiology, National Institute of Mental Health, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland 20892, USA."

22621900,"GGA1-mediated endocytic traffic of LR11/SorLA alters APP intracellular distribution and amyloid-β production.","Proteolytic processing of the amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) and generation of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) are key events in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Cell biological and genetic evidence has implicated the low-density lipoprotein and sorting receptor LR11/SorLA in AD through mechanisms related to APP and Aβ production. Defining the cellular pathway(s) by which LR11 modulates Aβ production is critical to understanding how changes in LR11 expression affect the development of Aβ pathology in AD progression. We report that the LR11 ectodomain is required for LR11-mediated reduction of Aβ and that mutagenesis of the LR11 Golgi-localizing, γ-adaptin ear homology domain, ADP-ribosylation factor (GGA)-binding motif affects the endosomal distribution of LR11, as well as LR11's effects on APP traffic and Aβ production. Targeted small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown studies of GGA1, GGA2, and GGA3 indicate a surprising degree of specificity toward GGA1, suggesting that GGA1 is a candidate regulator of LR11 traffic. Additional siRNA knockdown experiments reveal that GGA1 is necessary for both LR11 and β-site APP-cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE1) modulation of APP processing to Aβ. Mutagenesis of BACE1 serine 498 to alanine enhances BACE1 targeting to LR11-positive compartments and nullifies LR11-mediated reduction of Aβ. On basis of these results, we propose that GGA1 facilitates LR11 endocytic traffic and that LR11 modulates Aβ levels by promoting APP traffic to the endocytic recycling compartment.","1939-4586","Molecular biology of the cell","(23) 2645-57",2012,"Jeremy H","Herskowitz","JH","Center for Neurodegenerative Disease, Department of Neurology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA 30322, USA."

Subretinally-deposited amyloid β (Aβ) is a main contributor of developing AMD. However, the mechanism causing Aβ deposition in AMD eyes is unknown. Aging is the most significant risk of AMD, thus, we examined the effect of aging on subretinal Aβ deposition. mRNAs and cell lysates were isolated from retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells derived from 24-month-old (24M RPE) and 2-month-old (2M RPE) C57BL/6 mice. Aβ concentration in culture supernatants was measured by ELISA. Activity and expression of proteins that regulate Aβ level were examined by activity assay and real time PCR. Effect of β-secretase (BACE) on Aβ production was examined by siRNA silencing. Aβ amounts in supernatants of 24M RPE were significantly higher than 2M RPE. Activity and mRNA levels of neprilysin, an Aβ degrading enzyme, were significantly decreased in 24M RPE compared to 2M RPE. PCR analysis found that BACE2 was significantly more abundantly expressed than BACE1 in RPE cells, however, inactivation of BACE2 gene did not affect Aβ production. BACE1 protein amounts did not differ between 24M and 2M RPE, however, BACE1 activity was significantly higher in 24M RPE compared to 2M RPE. There were no significant changes in the activities of α- or γ-secretase between 2M and 24M RPE. In conclusion, RPE cells produce more amounts of Aβ when they are senescent, and this is probably caused by a decrease in Aβ degradation due to a reduction in the expression and activity of neprilysin and an increase in Aβ synthesis due to increased activity of BACE1.","1090-2104","Biochemical and biophysical research communications","(423) 73-8",2012,"Jiying","Wang","J","Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, 1-5-45 Yushima, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan."
22654105,"Nuclear factor-κB regulates βAPP and β- and γ-secretases differently at physiological and supraphysiological Aβ concentrations.","Anatomical lesions in Alzheimer disease-affected brains mainly consist of senile plaques, inflammation stigmata, and oxidative stress. The nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) is a stress-activated transcription factor that is activated around senile plaques. We have assessed whether NF-κB could be differentially regulated at physiological or supraphysiological levels of amyloid β (Aβ) peptides. Under these experimental conditions, we delineated the putative NF-κB-dependent modulation of all cellular participants in Aβ production, namely its precursor βAPP (β-amyloid precursor protein) and the β- and γ-secretases, the two enzymatic machines involved in Aβ genesis. Under physiological conditions, NF-κB lowers the transcriptional activity of the promoters of βAPP, β-secretase (β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1, BACE1), and of the four protein components (Aph-1, Pen-2, nicastrin, presenilin-1, or presenilin-2) of the γ-secretase in HEK293 cells. This was accompanied by a reduction of both protein levels and enzymatic activities, thereby ultimately yielding lower amounts of Aβ and AICD (APP intracellular domain). In stably transfected Swedish βAPP-expressing HEK293 cells triggering supraphysiological concentrations of Aβ peptides, NF-κB activates the transcription of βAPP, BACE1, and some of the γ-secretase members and increases protein expression and enzymatic activities, resulting in enhanced Aβ production. Our pharmacological approach using distinct NF-κB kinase modulators indicates that both NF-κB canonical and alternative pathways are involved in the control of Aβ production. Overall, our data demonstrate that under physiological conditions, NF-κB triggers a repressive effect on Aβ production that contributes to maintaining its homeostasis, while NF-κB participates in a degenerative cycle where Aβ would feed its own production under pathological conditions.","1083-351X","The Journal of biological chemistry","(287) 24573-84",2012,"Linda","Chami","L","Équipe Labellisée ""Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale"" and ""Excellence Laboratory Distalz"", Institut de Pharmacologie Moléculaire et Cellulaire, UMR7275 CNRS/UNSA, 660 Route des Lucioles, 06560, Valbonne, France."
22664922,"Regulation of BACE1 by miR-29a/b in a cellular model of Spinocerebellar Ataxia 17.","Polyglutamine diseases are a class of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by expansion of polyglutamine repeats, protein aggregation and neuronal cell death in specific regions of the brain. The expansion of a polyglutamine repeat in the TATA binding protein (TBP) causes a neurodegenerative disease, Spinocerebellar Ataxia 17 (SCA17). This disease is characterized by intranuclear protein aggregates and selective loss of cerebellar neurons, including Purkinje cells. MicroRNAs are small, endogenous, regulatory non-coding RNA molecules that bind to messenger RNAs with partial complementarity and interfere in their expression. Here, we used a cellular model of SCA17 where we expressed TBP with 16 (normal) or 59 (pathogenic) polyglutamines and found differential expression of several microRNAs. Specifically, we found two microRNAs, miR-29a/b, were down-regulated. With miR-29a/b down regulation, we found an increased expression of targets of miR-29a/b -beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), p53 upregulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) and BAK, increased cytochrome c release and apoptosis. Restoration of miR-29a/b in the pathogenic polyglutamine background reduced the BACE1expression. While, antagomiRs against miR-29a/b resulted in an increase in BACE1 levels and neuronal apoptosis. In spite of the elevation of BACE1 in Alzhemiers disease, its role in neuronal cell death has not been established. Here, we show that increased BACE1 expression is not sufficient to cause apoptosis. However restoring level of BACE1 to normal in polyglutamine cells partially reduced neuronal apoptosis. We show a role for the miR-29a/b-BACE1 regulatory interaction in SCA17, suggesting that this microRNA could be part of a common molecular mechanism leading to neuronal cell death in multiple neurodegenerative disorders. The identification of a common mechanism of microRNA mediated neurodegeneration not only improves our understanding of the process, but also provides promising and novel therapeutic targets.","1555-8584","RNA biology","(9) 891-9",2012,"Reema","Roshan","R","Institute of Genomics Integrative Biology, Functional Genomics Unit, Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, Near Jubilee Hall, Mall Road, Delhi 110 007, India."

A recently developed cell-permeable peptide, termed Tat-Pro, disrupts the complex between synapse-associated protein 97 (SAP97) and the α-secretase a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 10 (ADAM10), thereby leading to an alteration of the trafficking of the enzyme, which is important for nonamyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP). We report that Tat-Pro treatment, as well as the treatment with exogenous Aβ, deregulates Ca(2+) homeostasis specifically in astrocytes through increased expression of key components of Ca(2+) signaling, metabotropic glutamate receptor-5 and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor-1. This is accompanied by potentiation of (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine-induced Ca(2+) transients. Calcineurin inhibition reverts all these effects. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that astrocytes express all the components for the amyloidogenic and nonamyloidogenic processing of APP including APP itself, beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), ADAM10, γ-secretase, and SAP97. Indeed, treatment with Tat-Pro for 48 hours significantly increased the amount of Aβ(1-42) in the medium of cultured astrocytes. Taken together, our results suggest that astroglia might be active players in Aβ production and indicate that the calcium hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease may recognize glial cells as important intermediates.","1558-1497","Neurobiology of aging","(34) 511-22",2013,"Ambra A","Grolla","AA","DiSCAFF, Università degli Studi del Piemonte Orientale Amedeo Avogadro, Novara, Italy."

Exacerbated activation of calpain has been implicated as a major component in the signaling cascade that leads to β-amyloid (Aβ) production and tau hyperphosphorylation in Alzheimer's disease (AD). In this study, we analyzed the potential therapeutic efficacy of inhibiting the activation of calpain by a novel calpain inhibitor in aged 3xTgAD mice with well-established cognitive impairment, plaques, and tangles. The administration of a novel inhibitor of calpain, A-705253, attenuated cognitive impairment and synaptic dysfunction in a dose-dependent manner in 3xTgAD mice. Inhibition of calpain lowered Aβ(40) and Aβ(42) levels in both detergent-soluble and detergent-insoluble fractions and also reduced the total number and size of thioflavin S-positive fibrillar Aβ deposits. Mechanistically, these effects were, in part, explained by a down-regulation of β-secretase 1 (BACE1) and an up-regulation of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) expression, which, in turn, contributed to reduced production and increased clearance of Aβ, respectively. Moreover, A-705253 decreased the activation of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) and thereby diminished the hyperphosphorylation of tau. Finally, blockage of calpain activation reduced the astrocytic and microglial responses associated with AD-like pathological characteristics in aged 3xTgAD mice.

In Alzheimer's disease, Aβ is excessively produced or less dismissed, but the hypothesis on its physiological and pathological role are heterogeneous and often discordant. It has been described a positive feedback loop from the γ- to the β-secretase cleavages of Aβ precursor protein, which is activated by mutations of Presenilin 1 (PS1), the catalytic core of the γ-secretase. These findings show that Aβ precursor protein as well the activity of the γ-secretase are required to obtain the up-regulation of β-secretase which is induced by Presenilin 1 mutations. Then, Aβ 1-42 is the Aβ precursor protein derivative that up-regulates the expression of β-secretase, and c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/c-Jun and ERK1/2 are involved. Here, we describe the activation of β-secretase and c-jun N-terminal kinase related proteins by monomeric Aβ 1-42, defining the conditions that most efficiently strike the described signaling without producing toxicity.

However, the physiologic activity of Aβ peptides remains elusive: Aβ might not only play a toxic role, but also act as a functional signaling intermediate. We recently reported that Aβ1-42 promotes BACE1 transcription through the activation of the JNK-c-jun pathway. Here, we show that the Aβ1-42-mediated increase in BACE1 expression is accompanied by a decrease in ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (Uch-L1) expression and activity in different cellular models such as neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y as well as NT(2) neuronal cells. We also found that the increase in BACE1 and the decrease in Uch-L1 are related events and depend on NF-κB pathway; thus, Aβ1-42 is able to activate NF-κB pathway and the pretreatment with a pharmacological inhibitor, able to block the nuclear translocation of the transactivating unit p65, almost completely prevents both the decrease in Uch-L1 and the increase in BACE1 expression. In addition, the decrease in Uch-L1 activity interferes with the lysosomal degradation of BACE1, as demonstrated by the decrease in Cathepsin D activity and the partial accumulation of BACE1 in lysosomes after Aβ1-42 treatment as well after Uch-L1 inhibition. In support of the in vitro data, we observed low protein levels of Uch-L1 associated with high protein levels of BACE1 in sporadic AD brains.

22727944,"Palmitate-activated astrocytes via serine palmitoyltransferase increase BACE1 in primary neurons by sphingomyelinases.","Astrocytes play a critical role in neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Previously, we showed that saturated free fatty acid, palmitic acid (PA), upregulates β-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) level and amyloidogenesis in primary rat neurons mediated by astrocytes. However, the molecular mechanisms by which conditioned media from PA-treated astrocytes upregulates BACE1 level in neurons are unknown. This study demonstrates that serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT) in the astrocytes increases ceramide levels, which enhances the release of cytokines that mediate the activation of neural and acidic sphingomyelinase (SMase) in the neurons, to propagate the deleterious effects of PA (i.e., BACE1 upregulation). In support of the relevance of SPT in AD, our laboratory recently measured and found SPT levels to be significantly upregulated in AD brains as compared with controls. Cytokines, namely tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β, released into the conditioned media of PA-treated astrocytes activate neural and acidic SMase in the neurons. Neutralizing the cytokines in the PA-treated astrocyte conditioned media reduced BACE1 upregulation. However, inhibiting SPT in the astrocytes decreased the levels of both tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β in the conditioned media, which in turn reduced the SMase activities and BACE1 level in primary neurons. Thus, our results suggest that the activation of the astrocytes by PA is mediated by SPT, and the activated astrocytes increases BACE1 level in the neurons; the latter is mediate by the SMases.","1558-1497","Neurobiology of aging","(34) 540-50",2013,"Li","Liu","L","Department of Microbiology and Molecular Genetics, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824, USA."

However, epigenetic mechanisms could underlie this complexity. Here, we explored the potential role of epigenetic alterations in AD by investigating gene expression levels and chromatin remodeling in selected AD-related genes. Analysis was performed in the brain of the triple transgenic animal model of AD (3xTg-AD) and in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients diagnosed with AD or Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI). BACE1 mRNA levels were increased in aged 3xTg-AD mice as well as in AD PBMCs along with an increase in promoter accessibility and histone H3 acetylation, while the BACE1 promoter region was less accessible in PBMCs from MCI individuals. Ncstn was downregulated in aged 3xTg-AD brains with a condensation of chromatin and Sirt1 mRNA levels were decreased in these animals despite alterations in histone H3 acetylation. Neither gene was altered in AD PBMCs. The ADORA2A gene was not altered in patients or in the 3xTg-AD mice. Overall, our results suggest that chromatin remodeling plays a role in mRNA alterations in AD, prompting for broader and more detailed studies of chromatin and other epigenetic alterations and their potential use as biomarkers in AD.","1873-7544","Neuroscience","(220) 256-66",2012,"S C F","Marques","SC","Center for Neuroscience and Cell Biology, University of Coimbra, Portugal."

We developed the secretome protein enrichment with click sugars (SPECS) method, which allows proteome-wide identification of shedding substrates and secreted proteins from primary cells, even in the presence of serum proteins. SPECS combines metabolic glycan labelling and click chemistry-mediated biotinylation and distinguishes between cellular and serum proteins. SPECS identified 34, mostly novel substrates of the Alzheimer protease BACE1 in primary neurons, making BACE1 a major sheddase in the nervous system. Selected BACE1 substrates-seizure-protein 6, L1, CHL1 and contactin-2-were validated in brains of BACE1 inhibitor-treated and BACE1 knock-out mice. For some substrates, BACE1 was the major sheddase, whereas for other substrates additional proteases contributed to total substrate shedding. The new substrates point to a central function of BACE1 in neurite outgrowth and synapse formation. SPECS is also suitable for quantitative secretome analyses of primary cells and may be used for the discovery of biomarkers secreted from tumour or stem cells.","1460-2075","The EMBO journal","(31) 3157-68",2012,"Peer-Hendrik","Kuhn","PH","DZNE-German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases, Munich, Germany."

BACE1 is partially localized in lipid rafts. We investigated whether lipid raft localization of BACE1 affects Aβ production in neurons using a palmitoylation-deficient mutant and further analyzed the relationship between palmitoylation of BACE1 and its shedding and dimerization. We initially confirmed that BACE1 is mainly palmitoylated at four C-terminal cysteine residues in stably transfected neuroblastoma cells. We found that raft localization of mutant BACE1 lacking the palmitoylation modification was markedly reduced in comparison to wild-type BACE1 in neuroblastoma cells as well as rat primary cortical neurons expressing BACE1 via recombinant adenoviruses. In primary neurons, expression of wild-type and mutant BACE1 enhanced production of Aβ from endogenous or overexpressed APP to similar extents with the β-C-terminal fragment (β-CTF) of APP mainly distributed in nonraft fractions. Similarly, β-CTF was recovered mainly in nonraft fractions of neurons expressing Swedish mutant APP only. These results show that raft association of BACE1 does not influence β-cleavage of APP and Aβ production in neurons, and support the view that BACE1 cleaves APP mainly in nonraft domains. Thus, we propose a model of neuronal Aβ generation involving mobilization of β-CTF from nonraft to raft domains. Additionally, we obtained data indicating that palmitoylation plays a role in BACE1 shedding but not dimerization.","2162-3279","Brain and behavior","(2) 270-82",2012,"Kazumi","Motoki","K",""

Reticulon (RTN) proteins such as RTN3 have been identified as membrane proteins that interact with BACE1 and inhibit its Aβ-generating activity. In this study, we investigated whether RTN3 can regulate Aβ production in vivo, using transgenic (Tg) mice expressing APP with Swedish and London mutations (APP Tg mice) and those expressing RTN3; the latter mice showed ~1.4-fold higher expression levels of RTN3 protein in the cerebral cortex than non-Tg controls. We analyzed the brains of single APP Tg and double APP/RTN3 Tg mice at the age of approximately 15 months. The levels of secreted APP-β, a direct BACE1 cleavage product of APP, in Tris-soluble fraction were considerably reduced in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of APP/RTN3 Tg mice relative to those in APP Tg mice. Immunohistochemical analyses demonstrated that Aβ burden and plaques were significantly (by approximately 50%) decreased in both the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of double Tg mice compared to APP Tg mice. Furthermore, the levels of guanidine-soluble Aβ40 and Aβ42 in these brain regions of APP/RTN3 Tg mice were relatively lower than those in APP Tg mice. These findings indicate that even a small increase in RTN3 expression exerts suppressive effects on amyloidogenic processing of APP and Aβ accumulation through modulation of BACE1 activity in vivo, and suggest that induction of RTN3 might be an effective therapeutic strategy against Alzheimer's disease.","1875-5828","Current Alzheimer research","(10) 135-42",2013,"Wataru","Araki","W","Department of Demyelinating Disease and Aging, National Institute of Neuroscience, NCNP, 4-1-1 Ogawahigashi, Kodaira, Tokyo 187-8502, Japan. araki@ncnp.go.jp"

Hypertension is the most-prevalent modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality worldwide, and clinical data suggest that hypertension is a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present study we tested whether propranolol, a β-receptor antagonist commonly used as antihypertensive drug, could ameliorate the cognitive impairments and increases in AD-related markers shown by the senescence-accelerated mouse prone-8 (SAMP8). Propranolol administration (5 mg/kg for 3 weeks) to 6-month-old SAMP8 mice attenuated cognitive memory impairments shown by these mice in the novel object recognition test. In the hippocampus of SAMP8 mice it has been found increases in Aβ(42) levels, the principal constituent of amyloid plaques observed in AD, accompanied by both an increased expression of the cleaving enzyme BACE1 and a decreased expression of the degrading enzyme IDE. All these effects were reversed by propranolol treatment. Tau hyperphosphorylation (PHF-1 epitope) shown by SAMP8 mice at this age was also decreased in the hippocampus of propranolol-treated mice, an effect probably related to a decrease in JNK1 expression. Interestingly, propranolol also phosphorylated Akt in SAMP8 mice, which was associated with an increase of glycogen synthase kinase-3β phosphorylation, contributing therefore to the reductions in Tau hyperphosphorylation. Synaptic pathology in SAMP8 mice, as shown by decreases in synaptophysin and BDNF, was also counteracted by propranolol treatment. Overall, propranolol might be beneficial in age-related brain dysfunction and could be an emerging candidate for the treatment of other neurodegenerative diseases.

Compelling evidence is accumulating that a single event of TBI is associated with increased levels of Aβ. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unknown. We report here that the BACE1 interacting protein, GGA3, is depleted while BACE1 levels increase in the acute phase after injury (48 h) in a mouse model of TBI. We further demonstrated the role of GGA3 in the regulation of BACE1 in vivo by showing that BACE1 levels are increased in the brain of GGA3-null mice. We next found that head trauma potentiates BACE1 elevation in GGA3-null mice in the acute phase after TBI, and discovered that GGA1, a GGA3 homolog, is a novel caspase-3 substrate depleted at 48 h after TBI. Moreover, GGA1 silencing potentiates BACE1 elevation induced by GGA3 deletion in neurons in vitro, indicating that GGA1 and GGA3 synergistically regulate BACE1. Accordingly, we found that levels of both GGA1 and GGA3 are depleted while BACE1 levels are increased in a series of postmortem AD brains. Finally, we show that GGA3 haploinsufficiency results in sustained elevation of BACE1 and Aβ levels while GGA1 levels are restored in the subacute phase (7 d) after injury. In conclusion, our data indicate that depletion of GGA1 and GGA3 engender a rapid and robust elevation of BACE1 in the acute phase after injury. However, the efficient disposal of the acutely accumulated BACE1 solely depends on GGA3 levels in the subacute phase of injury.","1529-2401","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","(32) 10423-37",2012,"Kendall R","Walker","KR","Alzheimer's Disease Research Laboratory, Department of Neuroscience, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts 02111, USA."

22855816,"Cross-linking of cell surface amyloid precursor protein leads to increased β-amyloid peptide production in hippocampal neurons: implications for Alzheimer's disease.","The accumulation of the β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is thought to play a causative role in triggering synaptic dysfunction in neurons, leading to their eventual demise through apoptosis. Aβ is produced and secreted upon sequential cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β-secretases and γ-secretases. However, while Aβ levels have been shown to be increased in the brains of AD patients, little is known about how the cleavage of APP and the subsequent generation of Aβ is influenced, or whether the cleavage process changes over time. It has been proposed that Aβ can bind APP and promote amyloidogenic processing of APP, further enhancing Aβ production. Proof of this idea has remained elusive because a clear mechanism has not been identified, and the promiscuous nature of Aβ binding complicates the task of demonstrating the idea. To work around these problems, we used an antibody-mediated approach to bind and cross-link cell-surface APP in cultured rat primary hippocampal neurons. Here we show that cross-linking of APP is sufficient to raise the levels of Aβ in viable neurons with a concomitant increase in the levels of the β-secretase BACE1. This appears to occur as a result of a sorting defect that stems from the caspase-3-mediated inactivation of a key sorting adaptor protein, namely GGA3, which prevents the lysosomal degradation of BACE1. Together, our data suggest the occurrence of a positive pathogenic feedback loop involving Aβ and APP in affected neurons possibly allowing Aβ to spread to nearby healthy neurons.","1529-2401","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","(32) 10674-85",2012,"Roger","Lefort","R","Taub Institute for Research on Alzheimer's Disease and the Aging Brain and Department of Pathology and Cell Biology, Columbia University, New York, New York 10032, USA."

In order to fill this gap, we established a cell-culture based model with simultaneous knockdown of all members of the family. A comprehensive proteome study of the APP/APLP1/APLP2 knockdown cell lysates versus controls revealed significant protein abundance changes of more than 30 proteins. Targeted validation of selected candidates by immunoblotting supported the significant down-regulation of the methionine adenosyltransferase II, alpha (MAT2A) as well as of peroxiredoxin 4 in the knockdown cells. Moreover, MAT2A was significantly down-regulated at the mRNA level as well. MAT2A catalyzes the production of S-adenosylmethionine from methionine and ATP, which plays a pivotal role in the methylation of neurotransmitters, DNA, proteins, and lipids. MAT2A-dependent significant up-regulation of S-adenosylmethionine was also detectable in the knockdown cells compared with controls. Our results point to a role of the APP family proteins in cellular methylation mechanisms and fit to findings of disturbed S-adenosylmethionine levels in tissue and CSF of Alzheimer disease patients versus controls. Importantly, methylation plays a central role for neurotransmitter generation like acetylcholine pointing to a crucial relevance of our findings for Alzheimer's disease. In addition, we identified differential gene expression of BACE1 and PSEN1 in the knockdown cells, which is possibly a consequence of MAT2A deregulation and may indicate a self regulatory mechanism.","1535-9484","Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP","(11) 1274-88",2012,"Andreas","Schrötter","A","Functional Proteomics, Medizinisches Proteom-Center, Ruhr-University Bochum, D-44801 Bochum, Germany."

Here, we present a detailed immunochemical and mass spectrometric characterization of primary structures of Aβ peptides secreted by 7PA2 cells. Immunoprecipitation and western blot of 7PA2 cell culture media revealed abundant anti-Aβ immunoreactive bands in the molecular weight range of 4-20 kDa. Mass spectrometric analysis showed that these bands contain several AβPP/Aβ peptides, starting at the N-terminal of the Aβ sequence and extending across the BACE1 cleavage site. Treatment of cells with a BACE1 inhibitor decreased the abundance of the Aβ monomer band by western blot and resulted in lower levels of Aβ1-40, Aβ1-42, and sAβPPβ as measured by ELISA. However, western blot bands thought to represent oligomers of Aβ increased in response to BACE1 inhibition. This increase was paralleled by the emergence of N-terminally truncated Aβ species (Aβ5-40 in particular) and Aβ species that spanned the β-secretase site in AβPP according to mass spectrometric analyses. The formation of these AβPP/Aβ peptides may have implications for the use of the 7PA2 cell line as a model for Aβ pathology.

BACE1 is the rate-limiting enzyme for Aβ production, and an increase in BACE1 level/activity contributes to the pathogenesis of sporadic AD. In addition to cleaving APP for Aβ generation, BACE1 plays multiple physiological roles including the regulation of synaptic functions. Here, we found that overexpression of BACE1 reduces cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) phosphorylation, protein kinase A (PKA) activity, and cAMP levels, whereas downregulation of BACE1 has the opposite effect. We showed that BACE1's effect is independent of its activity for Aβ production, which is corroborated by the observation that BACE1 transgenic mice have impaired learning/memory in the absence of neurotoxic human Aβ. Furthermore, we demonstrated that BACE1 interacts via its transmembrane domain with adenylate cyclase, resulting in reduction of cellular cAMP levels and thus PKA inactivation and reduced CREB phosphorylation. Our study suggests that in addition to its function as the β-secretase to produce Aβ, BACE1 may contribute to the memory and cognitive deficits typical of AD by regulating the cAMP/PKA/CREB pathway, which is important for memory functions.","1529-2401","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","(32) 11390-5",2012,"Yaomin","Chen","Y","Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Neurodegenerative Disease and Aging Research, College of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian 361005, China."

BACE1 expression is highest in the neural retina while BACE2 was greatest in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)/choroid. Pigment epithelial-derived factor, a known regulator of γ-secretase, inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-induced in vitro and in vivo angiogenesis and this is abolished by BACE1 inhibition. Moreover, intravitreal administration of BACE1 inhibitor or BACE1 small interfering RNA (siRNA) increases choroidal neovascularization in mice. BACE1 induces ectodomain shedding of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR1) which is a prerequisite for γ-secretase release of a 100 kDa intracellular domain. The increase in lipofuscin following BACE1 inhibition and RNAI knockdown is associated with lysosomal perturbations. Taken together, our data show that BACE1 plays a critical role in retinal homeostasis and that the use of BACE inhibitors for AD should be viewed with extreme caution as they could lead to retinal pathology and exacerbate conditions such as age-related macular degeneration.","1757-4684","EMBO molecular medicine","(4) 980-91",2012,"Jun","Cai","J","Department of Anatomy & Cell Biology, University of Florida, Gainesville, USA."

Various GAG analogs were incubated with primary cortical cells derived from APP (SW)Tg2576 mice and the level of APP, proteolytic products of APP and APP-cleavage enzymes were measured. The effect of GAGs on APP processing was both size- and sulfation-dependent. 6-O-Sulfation was important for the effect on APP processing as heparin lacking 6-O sulfate were less potent than native heparin. However, deletion of carboxyl groups on heparin had no significant effect on APP processing. Our studies suggest that there is structural specificity to the effect of GAGs on APP processing and that certain GAGs have a greater effect on Aβ production than others. This suggests that it might be possible to alter the structure of GAGs to achieve more specific inhibitors of APP processing that can cross the blood-brain barrier.","1471-4159","Journal of neurochemistry","(123) 447-57",2012,"Hao","Cui","H","Menzies Research Institute Tasmania, University of Tasmania, Hobart, Tasmania, Australia."
22911925,"Establishing the relationship between in vitro potency, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic parameters in a series of orally available, hydroxyethylamine-derived β-secretase inhibitors.","Sequential proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and the γ-secretase complex produces the amyloid-β peptide (Aβ), which is believed to play a critical role in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The aspartyl protease BACE1 catalyzes the rate-limiting step in the production of Aβ, and as such it is considered to be an important target for drug development in AD. The development of a BACE1 inhibitor therapeutic has proven to be difficult. The active site of BACE1 is relatively large. Consequently, to achieve sufficient potency, many BACE1 inhibitors have required unfavorable physicochemical properties such as high molecular weight and polar surface area that are detrimental to efficient passage across the blood-brain barrier. Using a rational drug design approach we have designed and developed a new series of hydroxyethylamine-based inhibitors of BACE1 capable of lowering Aβ levels in the brains of rats after oral administration. Herein we describe the in vitro and in vivo characterization of two of these molecules and the overall relationship of compound properties [e.g., in vitro permeability, P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux, metabolic stability, and pharmacological potency] to the in vivo pharmacodynamic effect with more than 100 compounds across the chemical series. We demonstrate that high in vitro potency for BACE1 was not sufficient to provide central efficacy. A combination of potency, high permeability, low P-gp-mediated efflux, and low clearance was required for compounds to produce robust central Aβ reduction after oral dosing.","1521-0103","The Journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics","(343) 460-7",2012,"Stephen","Wood","S","Department of Neuroscience, Amgen, Inc., One Amgen Center Drive, 29-2-B, Thousand Oaks, CA 91320, USA. stephenw@amgen.com"

Furthermore, APP expression is increased following ischemic or hypoxic conditions, as is the production of the Aβ peptide. To address the question of why APP and Aβ are increased in hypoxic and ischemic conditions we induced an ischemic episode in APP knockout mice (APP-/-) and BACE1 knockout mice (BACE-/-). We find that both APP-/- and BACE-/- mice have a dramatically increased risk of mortality as a result of cerebral ischemia. Furthermore, APP knockout mice have reduced cerebral blood flow in response to hypoxia, while wild-type mice maintain or increase cerebral blood flow to the same conditions. The transcription factor, serum response factor (SRF), and calcium-binding molecule, calsequestrin, both involved in vascular regulation, are significantly altered in the brains of APP-/- mice compared to wild type controls. These results show that APP regulates cerebral blood flow in response to hypoxia, and that it, and its cleavage fragments, are crucial for rapid adaptation to ischemic conditions.","1932-6203","PloS one","(7) e42665",2012,"Maya A","Koike","MA","Institute for Memory Impairments and Neurological Disorders, University of California Irvine, Irvine, California, United States of America."

In the present study, the ameliorating effects of curculigoside were determined through animal behaviour studies (including step-down test and Y-maze test), and the possible mechanisms were explored by evaluation of the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AchE) and determination of the expression of BACE1. Oral adminstration of the curculigoside (20, 40 mg/kg/day) for 14 days can significantly improve the latency and number of errors in aged rats based on the behaviour study results. In addition, the activity of AchE can be decreased by treatment of the curculigoside (10, 20, 40 mg/kg/day). Moreover, the expression of BACE1 can be down-regulated in the hippocampus of aged rats treated with curculigoside. The results of our present work have indicated that curculigoside can improve cognitive function in aged animals, possibly by decreasing the activity of AchE in the cerebra and inhibiting the expression of BACE1 in the hippocampus. In conclusion, our results suggested that curculigoside can be possible developed as a new drug for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease in the future.","1420-3049","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)","(17) 10108-18",2012,"Xiu-Ying","Wu","XY","Department of Geraeology, First Affiliated Hospital of Suzhou University, Suzhou 215006, China."

Aβ, the product of the large type1 trans-membrane protein amyloid precursor protein (APP), is produced in a two-step proteolytic process initiated by BACE1 (β-secretase) and followed by γ-secretase. Due to its apparent rate limiting function, BACE1 appears to be a prime target to prevent Aβ generation in AD.

22931791,"Accumulation of autophagosomes contributes to enhanced amyloidogenic APP processing under insulin-resistant conditions.","Alzheimer disease (AD) is sometimes referred to as type III diabetes because of the shared risk factors for the two disorders. Insulin resistance, one of the major components of type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM), is a known risk factor for AD. Insulin resistance increases amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) generation, but the exact mechanism underlying the linkage of insulin resistance to increased Aβ generation in the brain is unknown. In this study, we investigated the effect of insulin resistance on amyloid β (A4) precursor protein (APP) processing in mice fed a high-fat diet (HFD), and diabetic db/db mice. We found that insulin resistance promotes Aβ generation in the brain via altered insulin signal transduction, increased BACE1/β-secretase and γ-secretase activities, and accumulation of autophagosomes. Using an in vitro model of insulin resistance, we found that defects in insulin signal transduction affect autophagic flux by inhibiting the mechanistic target of rapamycin (MTOR) pathway. The insulin resistance-induced autophagosome accumulation resulted in alteration of APP processing through enrichment of secretase proteins in autophagosomes. We speculate that the insulin resistance that underlies the pathogenesis of T2DM might alter APP processing through autophagy activation, which might be involved in the pathogenesis of AD. Therefore, we propose that insulin resistance-induced autophagosome accumulation becomes a potential linker between AD and T2DM.","1554-8635","Autophagy","(8) 1842-4",2012,"Sung Min","Son","SM","Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences, Seoul National University College of Medicine, Seoul, Korea."

The α-secretase ADAM10 and the β-secretase BACE1 have opposite effects on Aβ generation and are assumed to compete for APP as a substrate, such that their cleavages are inversely coupled. This concept was mainly demonstrated in studies using activation or overexpression of α- and β-secretases. Here, we report that this inverse coupling is not seen to the same extent upon inhibition of the endogenous proteases. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of ADAM10 and BACE1 revealed that the endogenous, constitutive α-secretase cleavage of APP is largely uncoupled from β-secretase cleavage and Aβ generation in neuroglioma H4 cells and in neuronally differentiated SH-SY5Y cells. In contrast, inverse coupling was observed in primary cortical neurons. However, this coupling was not bidirectional. Inhibition of BACE1 increased ADAM10 cleavage of APP, but a reduction of ADAM10 activity did not increase the BACE1 cleavage of APP in the neurons. Our analysis shows that the inverse coupling of the endogenous α- and β-secretase cleavages depends on the cellular model and suggests that a reduction of ADAM10 activity is unlikely to increase the AD risk through increased β-secretase cleavage.

Recent evidence suggests that the prion protein (PrP) interacts directly with BACE1 regulating its β-secretase activity. Moreover, PrP has been proposed as the cellular receptor involved in the impairment of synaptic plasticity and toxicity caused by Aβ oligomers. Provided that common pathophysiologic mechanisms are shared by Alzheimer's and Creutzfeldt-Jakob (CJD) diseases, we investigated for the first time to the best of our knowledge a possible association of a common synonymous BACE1 polymorphism (rs638405) with sporadic CJD (sCJD). Our results indicate that BACE1 C-allele is associated with an increased risk for developing sCJD, mainly in PRNP M129M homozygous subjects with early onset. These results extend the very short list of genes (other than PRNP) involved in the development of human prion diseases; and support the notion that similar to AD, in sCJD several loci may contribute with modest overall effects to disease risk. These findings underscore the interplay in both pathologies of APP, Aβ oligomers, ApoE, PrP and BACE1, and suggest that aging and perhaps vascular risk factors may modulate disease pathologies in part through these key players.","1932-6203","PloS one","(7) e43926",2012,"Olga","Calero","O","Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red sobre Enfermedades Neurodegenerativas, Madrid, Spain."

Altering 3 SUMO isoforms affects BACE1 protein levels, and consequently results in altered amyloid precursor protein processing and Aβ generation. BACE1 levels were increased in response to Aβ or apoptosis, but not in cells lacking SUMO1. Aβ increased SUMO1 protein levels in rat cortical neurons. Moreover, SUMO1 immunoreactivity was increased in the amyloid precursor protein transgenic mice. Furthermore, the C-terminus fragments of BACE1 containing dileucine motif reduced Aβ generation by SUMO1 overexpression.

Fatty acid alterations in AD brains have recently received substantial attention. Because increased very long chain fatty acid (VLCFA) levels in AD brains imply that peroxisomal β-oxidation dysfunction may be associated with AD pathogenesis, we investigated the effects of impaired peroxisomal β-oxidation on Aβ generation in vivo and in vitro using thioridazine, a selective peroxisomal β-oxidation inhibitor. Under the experimental conditions, thioridazine caused VLCFA accumulation and increases in Aβ(40) content, APP immunoreactivity and APP(751+770) mRNA expressions in the rat cerebral cortex. A correlation analysis showed that the Aβ(40) levels were positively correlated with the cortex C(24:0) and C(26:0) levels. Additionally, the primary cerebral cortex neurons treated with this compound showed increases in APP(751+770) mRNA, APP protein, BACE1 mRNA and protein, and secreted Aβ40 levels.

Plasma BACE activity assay was sensitive and specific, with signal being immunodepleted with a specific BACE1 antibody and inhibited with a BACE1-specific inhibitor. Plasma sAPPβ and sAPPα assays were specific, with signal diluting linearly, immunodepleted with specific antibodies, and at background levels in APP knockout mice. In rhesus monkeys, BACE1 but not γ-secretase inhibitor led to significant lowering of plasma sAPPβ with concurrent elevation of plasma sAPPα. AD subjects showed a significant increase in plasma BACE1 activity, sAPPβ, sAPPα, and Aβ42 (P < 0.001) compared with age-matched controls.

However, little is known about the functions of BACE1. BACE1-deficient mice exhibit mild but complex neurological phenotypes suggesting therapeutic BACE1 inhibition may not be completely free of mechanism-based side effects. Recently, we have reported that BACE1 null mice have axon guidance defects in olfactory sensory neuron projections to glomeruli in the olfactory bulb. Here, we show that BACE1 deficiency also causes an axon guidance defect in the hippocampus, a shortened and disorganized infrapyramidal bundle of the mossy fiber projection from the dentate gyrus to CA3. Although we observed that a classical axon guidance molecule, EphA4, was cleaved by BACE1 when co-expressed with BACE1 in HEK293 cells, we could find no evidence of BACE1 processing of EphA4 in the brain. Remarkably, we discovered that the axon guidance defects of BACE1(-/-) mice were strikingly similar to those of mice deficient in a recently identified BACE1 substrate, the neural cell adhesion molecule close homolog of L1 (CHL1) that is involved in neurite outgrowth. CHL1 undergoes BACE1-dependent processing in BACE1(+/+), but not BACE1(-/-), hippocampus, and olfactory bulb, indicating that CHL1 is a BACE1 substrate in vivo. Finally, BACE1 and CHL1 co-localize in the terminals of hippocampal mossy fibers, olfactory sensory neuron axons, and growth cones of primary hippocampal neurons. We conclude that BACE1(-/-) axon guidance defects are likely the result of abrogated BACE1 processing of CHL1 and that BACE1 deficiency produces a CHL1 loss-of-function phenotype. Our results imply the possibility that axon mis-targeting may occur in adult neurogenic and/or regenerating neurons as a result of chronic BACE1 inhibition and add a note of caution to BACE1 inhibitor development.","1083-351X","The Journal of biological chemistry","(287) 38408-25",2012,"Brian","Hitt","B","Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, The Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois 60611, USA."

We isolated mid-frontal cortex (MFC) and mid-temporal cortex (MTC) from post-mortem ND and AD subjects that were APOE ε3/3, ε3/4, ε4/4 carriers. All AD subjects met NINDS-ADRDA and NIA-Reagan criteria for a diagnosis of AD. The MFC and MTC were homogenized and the lysates underwent ELISA and Western blotting for BACE1. The ELISA revealed that total BACE1 levels were lower in the MFC of AD compared to ND subjects. Furthermore, in APOE ε4 carriers BACE1 levels were lower than ε3/3 carriers in the ND frontal cortex. No difference in BACE1 levels was observed in AD MFC and in ND and AD MTC tissues. The ELISA results were confirmed by Western blotting. Our data suggest that brain BACEl levels may be influenced by the apolipoprotein E genotype before the onset of AD, providing an alternative explanation for the lower amyloid beta 42 levels in CSF in ND and AD subjects.","1875-5828","Current Alzheimer research","(10) 309-15",2013,"Boris","Decourt","B","Haldeman Laboratory of Molecular Diagnostics and Therapeutics, Banner Sun Health Research Institute, Sun City, AZ 85351, USA."

Accumulating evidence suggests that vascular factors play an important role in the pathogenesis of AD. Specifically, studies have suggested that one vascular factor in particular, oxidized low density lipoprotein (oxLDL), may play an important role in regulating Aβ formation in AD. However, the mechanism by which oxLDL modulates Aβ formation remains elusive. In this study, we report several new findings that provide biochemical evidence suggesting that the cardiovascular risk factor oxLDL may contribute to Alzheimer's disease by increasing Aβ production. First, we found that lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), the most bioactive component of oxLDL induces increased production of Aβ. Second, our data strongly indicate that LPA induces increased Aβ production via upregulating β-secretase expression. Third, our data strongly support the notion that different isoforms of protein kinase C (PKC) may play different roles in regulating APP processing. Specifically, most PKC members, such as PKCα, PKCβ, and PKCε, are implicated in regulating α-secretase-mediated APP processing; however, PKCδ, a member of the novel PKC subfamily, is involved in LPA-induced upregulation of β-secretase expression and Aβ production. These findings may contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms by which the cardiovascular risk factor oxLDL is involved in Alzheimer's disease.","0006-3002","Biochimica et biophysica acta","(1832) 29-38",2013,"Jing","Shi","J","Department of Biomedical and Diagnostic Sciences, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, TN 37996, USA."

Among various histological stigmata, AD-affected brains display several cellular dysfunctions reflecting enhanced oxidative stress, inflammation process and calcium homeostasis disturbance. Most of these alterations are directly or indirectly linked to amyloid β-peptides (Aβ), the production, molecular nature and biophysical properties of which likely conditions the degenerative process. It is particularly noticeable that, in a reverse control process, the above-described cellular dysfunctions alter Aβ peptides levels. β-secretase βAPP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is a key molecular contributor of this cross-talk. This enzyme is responsible for the primary cleavage generating the N-terminus of ""full length"" Aβ peptides and is also transcriptionally induced by several cellular stresses.

Here, we report the discovery and comprehensive preclinical characterization of AZD3839, a potent and selective inhibitor of human BACE1. AZD3839 was identified using fragment-based screening and structure-based design. In a concentration-dependent manner, AZD3839 inhibited BACE1 activity in a biochemical fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay, Aβ and sAPPβ release from modified and wild-type human SH-SY5Y cells and mouse N2A cells as well as from mouse and guinea pig primary cortical neurons. Selectivity against BACE2 and cathepsin D was 14 and >1000-fold, respectively. AZD3839 exhibited dose- and time-dependent lowering of plasma, brain, and cerebrospinal fluid Aβ levels in mouse, guinea pig, and non-human primate. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analyses of mouse and guinea pig data showed a good correlation between the potency of AZD3839 in primary cortical neurons and in vivo brain effects. These results suggest that AZD3839 effectively reduces the levels of Aβ in brain, CSF, and plasma in several preclinical species. It might, therefore, have disease-modifying potential in the treatment of Alzheimer disease and related dementias.

In some transgenic (Tg) models of Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyloid plaques develop in this structure, although the underlying cellular mechanism remains elusive. We attempted to explore the origin, evolution, and modulation of spinal β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition using Tg mice harboring five familiar AD-related mutations (5XFAD) as an experiential model. Dystrophic neuritic elements with enhanced β-secretase-1 (BACE1) immunoreactivity (IR) appeared as early as 2 months of age, and increased with age up to 12 months examined in this study, mostly over the ventral horn (VH). Extracellular Aβ IR emerged and developed during this same period, site-specifically co-existing with BACE1-labeled neurites often in the vicinity of large VH neurons that expressed the mutant human APP. The BACE1-labeled neurites almost invariably colocalized with β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and synaptophysin, and frequently with the vesicular glutamate transporter-1 (VGLUT). Reduced IR for the neuronal-specific nuclear antigen (NeuN) occurred in the VH by 12 months of age. In 8-month-old animals surviving 6 months after a unilateral sciatic nerve transection, there were significant increases of Aβ, BACE1, and VGLUT IR in the VN of the ipsilateral relative to contralateral lumbar spinal segments. These results suggest that extracellular Aβ deposition in 5XFAD mouse spinal cord relates to a progressive and amyloidogenic synaptic pathology largely involving presynaptic axon terminals from projection neurons in the brain. Spinal neuritic plaque formation is enhanced after peripheral axotomy, suggesting a retrograde transneuronal modulation on pathogenesis.","1476-3524","Neurotoxicity research","(24) 1-14",2013,"Jian-Ming","Li","JM","Neuroscience Research Center, Changsha Medical University, Changsha, 410219, Hunan, China."

However, the Phase III CONNECTION trial failed to demonstrate significant differences between dimebon and placebo treatments. Despite the controversial therapeutic outcomes in the treatment of AD, dimebon's mechanism(s) of action within the brain remain unclear. In the present study, we evaluated the effects of dimebon upon β-amyloid (Aβ), tau and astrocytes in the hippocampus of triple transgenic (3xTg-AD) mice, which develop AD-like pathology in an age-dependent manner. At age 6.5 months, prior to the development of Aβ plaques in the hippocampus, male and female 3xTg-AD mice, received a daily intraperitoneal injection of 0.1 % dimebon or saline for 1.5 months. At 8 months, quantitative immunohistochemistry revealed a significant reduction in hippocampal/subicular APP/Aβ in dimebon-treated mice, whereas protein bioassay found no change in full length APP, soluble Aβ(1-40) and Aβ(1-42), Aβ oligomers, BACE1 and GFAP levels between groups. Interestingly, the number of the hippocampal APP/Aβ plaques in female and male dimebon-treated mice was higher compared to gender-matched control mice. Dimebon did not alter hippocampal tau levels. Furthermore, dimebon protects SH-SY5Y neurons against Aβ toxicity and promotes GFAP expression in primary mouse astrocyte cultures. Our findings demonstrate that dimebon in vivo modifies hippocampal APP/Aβ pathology and in vitro protects against Aβ toxicity promoting cell survival and activates astrocytes.","1944-8171","International journal of physiology, pathophysiology and pharmacology","(4) 115-27",2012,"Sylvia E","Perez","SE","Department of Neurological Sciences, Rush University Medical Center Chicago, IL 60612."
23109336,"BACE1 protein endocytosis and trafficking are differentially regulated by ubiquitination at lysine 501 and the Di-leucine motif in the carboxyl terminus.","β-Site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme (BACE1) is a membrane-tethered member of the aspartyl proteases that has been identified as β-secretase. BACE1 is targeted through the secretory pathway to the plasma membrane and then is internalized to endosomes. Sorting of membrane proteins to the endosomes and lysosomes is regulated by the interaction of signals present in their carboxyl-terminal fragment with specific trafficking molecules. The BACE1 carboxyl-terminal fragment contains a di-leucine sorting signal ((495)DDISLL(500)) and a ubiquitination site at Lys-501. Here, we report that lack of ubiquitination at Lys-501 (BACE1K501R) does not affect the rate of endocytosis but produces BACE1 stabilization and accumulation of BACE1 in early and late endosomes/lysosomes as well as at the cell membrane. In contrast, the disruption of the di-leucine motif (BACE1LLAA) greatly impairs BACE1 endocytosis and produces a delayed retrograde transport of BACE1 to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) and a delayed delivery of BACE1 to the lysosomes, thus decreasing its degradation. Moreover, the combination of the lack of ubiquitination at Lys-501 and the disruption of the di-leucine motif (BACE1LLAA/KR) produces additive effects on BACE1 stabilization and defective internalization. Finally, BACE1LLAA/KR accumulates in the TGN, while its levels are decreased in EEA1-positive compartments indicating that both ubiquitination at Lys-501 and the di-leucine motif are necessary for the trafficking of BACE1 from the TGN to early endosomes. Our studies have elucidated a differential role for the di-leucine motif and ubiquitination at Lys-501 in BACE1 endocytosis, trafficking, and degradation and suggest the involvement of multiple adaptor molecules.","1083-351X","The Journal of biological chemistry","(287) 42867-80",2012,"Eugene L","Kang","EL","Alzheimer's Disease Research Laboratory, Department of Neuroscience, Tufts University School of Medicine, Boston, Massachusetts 02111, USA."

Among CV diseases, congestive heart failure (CHF) after myocardial infarction (MI) is a condition where the ability of the left ventricle to eject blood to the circulation is impaired. As a consequence, CHF triggers inflammation and results in reduced cerebral blood flow which are considered among the risk factors for development of AD. However, biochemical alterations in the brain following MI and CHF remain unknown. To address this issue, we investigated microglia activation; levels of BACE1, the key rate-limiting enzyme involved in the pathogenesis of AD; and VEGF levels in the hippocampus and cortex following MI. We created MI by the ligation of the left anterior descending coronary artery in Sprague-Dawley male rats and collected brains either 3 days after MI (AMI) or 21 days after MI (CHF). We investigated microglia activation in AMI and CHF brains by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting using macrophage/microglia marker Ionized calcium binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba-1), and observed activated morphology of microglia in the cortex of rats in both AMI and CHF. We also showed the levels of BACE1 were increased in the cortex and hippocampus of CHF rats. To determine whether hypoxia occurs in the CHF brain, we assessed levels of VEGF in the hippocampus and cortex. Western blotting analysis showed up-regulation of VEGF in the hippocampus of CHF brains. These results suggest that neuroinflammation takes place secondary to myocardial infarction. In addition, CHF-induced hypoxia might play a role in the elevation of BACE1 and VEGF levels.","1872-7972","Neuroscience letters","(532) 7-11",2013,"Hikmet F","Nural-Guvener","HF","Center for Cardiovascular Research at Banner Sun Health Research Institute, Sun City, AZ, USA."

Thus, inhibition of BACE1 function may cause adverse side effects. Here, we present a peptide, S1, isolated from a peptide library that selectively inhibits BACE1 hydrolytic activity by binding to the β-proteolytic site on APP and Aβ N-terminal. The S1 peptide significantly reduced Aβ levels in vitro and in vivo and inhibited Aβ cytotoxicity in SH-SY5Y cells. When applied to APPswe/PS1dE9 double transgenic mice by intracerebroventricular injection, S1 significantly improved the spatial memory as determined by the Morris Water Maze, and also attenuated their Aβ burden.

Consequently, the lack of BACE1 prevents β-processing of the amyloid precursor protein and Aβ production, which made it a promising target for drug development. However, the loss of BACE1 is also detrimental, leading to myelination defects and altered neuronal activity, functions that have been associated with the cleavage of Neuregulin and a voltage-gated sodium channel subunit. Here we show that the Drosophila ortholog of BACE, dBACE, is required for glial survival. Cell-specific knockdown experiments reveal that this is a non-cell autonomous function, as a knockdown of dBACE in photoreceptor neurons leads to progressive degeneration of glia in their target zone, the lamina. Interestingly, this phenotype is suppressed by the loss of the fly amyloid precursor protein (APPL), whereas a secretion-deficient form of APPL enhances the degeneration. This shows that full-length APPL in neurons promotes the death of neighboring glial cells and that β-processing of APPL is needed to prevent glial death. These results therefore not only demonstrate a novel function for an APP protein in glia, but they also show this function specifically requires regulation by β-cleavage.","1529-2401","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","(32) 16181-92",2012,"Bonnie J","Bolkan","BJ","Center for Research on Occupational and Environmental Toxicology, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon 97239, USA."

However, why and how epilepsy is associated with enhanced AD-like pathology remains unknown. We have recently shown β-secretase-1 (BACE1) elevation associated with aberrant limbic axonal sprouting in epileptic CD1 mice. Here we sought to explore whether BACE1 upregulation affected the development of Alzheimer-type neuropathology in mice expressing mutant human APP, presenilin and tau proteins, the triple transgenic model of AD (3×Tg-AD). 3×Tg-AD mice were treated with pilocarpine or saline (i.p.) at 6-8 months of age. Immunoreactivity (IR) for BACE1, β-amyloid (Aβ) and phosphorylated tau (p-tau) was subsequently examined at 9, 11 or 14 months of age. Recurrent convulsive seizures, as well as mossy fiber sprouting and neuronal death in the hippocampus and limbic cortex, were observed in all epileptic mice. Neuritic plaques composed of BACE1-labeled swollen/sprouting axons and extracellular AβIR were seen in the hippocampal formation, amygdala and piriform cortices of 9 month-old epileptic, but not control, 3×Tg-AD mice. Densities of plaque-associated BACE1 and AβIR were elevated in epileptic versus control mice at 11 and 14 months of age. p-Tau IR was increased in dentate granule cells and mossy fibers in epileptic mice relative to controls at all time points examined. Thus, pilocarpine-induced chronic epilepsy was associated with accelerated and enhanced neuritic plaque formation and altered intraneuronal p-tau expression in temporal lobe structures in 3×Tg-AD mice, with these pathologies occurring in regions showing neuronal death and axonal dystrophy.","1932-6203","PloS one","(7) e48782",2012,"Xiao-Xin","Yan","XX","Department of Anatomy and Neurobiology, Central South University Xiangya School of Medicine, Changsha, Hunan, China. yanxiaoxin@csu.edu.cn"

There are two highly conserved isoforms of GSK3: GSK3α and GSK3β. We now report that specific inhibition of GSK3β, but not GSK3α, reduced BACE1-mediated cleavage of APP and Aβ production by decreasing BACE1 gene transcription and expression. The regulation of BACE1 gene expression by GSK3β was dependent on NF-κB signaling. Inhibition of GSK3 signaling markedly reduced Aβ deposition and neuritic plaque formation, and rescued memory deficits in the double transgenic AD model mice. These data provide evidence for regulation of BACE1 expression and AD pathogenesis by GSK3β and that inhibition of GSK3 signaling can reduce Aβ neuropathology and alleviate memory deficits in AD model mice. Our study suggests that interventions that specifically target the β-isoform of GSK3 may be a safe and effective approach for treating AD.","1558-8238","The Journal of clinical investigation","(123) 224-35",2013,"Philip T T","Ly","PT","Townsend Family Laboratories, Department of Psychiatry, Brain Research Center, Graduate Program in Neuroscience, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada."
23213470,"Calsyntenin-1 shelters APP from proteolytic processing during anterograde axonal transport.","Endocytosis of amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) is thought to represent the major source of substrate for the production of the amyloidogenic Aβ peptide by the β-secretase BACE1. The irreversible nature of proteolytic cleavage implies the existence of an efficient replenishment route for APP from its sites of synthesis to the cell surface. We recently found that APP exits the trans-Golgi network in intimate association with calsyntenin-1, a transmembrane cargo-docking protein for Kinesin-1-mediated vesicular transport. Here we characterized the function of calsyntenin-1 in neuronal APP transport using selective immunoisolation of intracellular trafficking organelles, immunocytochemistry, live-imaging, and RNAi. We found that APP is co-transported with calsyntenin-1 along axons to early endosomes in the central region of growth cones in carriers that exclude the α-secretase ADAM10. Intriguingly, calsyntenin-1/APP organelles contained BACE1, suggesting premature cleavage of APP along its anterograde path. However, we found that APP contained in calsyntenin-1/APP organelles was stable. We further analyzed vesicular trafficking of APP in cultured hippocampal neurons, in which calsyntenin-1 was reduced by RNAi. We found a markedly increased co-localization of APP and ADAM10 in axons and growth cones, along with increased proteolytic processing of APP and Aβ secretion in these neurons. This suggested that the reduced capacity for calsyntenin-1-dependent APP transport resulted in mis-sorting of APP into additional axonal carriers and, therefore, the premature encounter of unprotected APP with its ectodomain proteases. In combination, our results characterize calsyntenin-1/APP organelles as carriers for sheltered anterograde axonal transport of APP.","2046-6390","Biology open","(1) 761-74",2012,"Martin","Steuble","M","Department of Biochemistry, University of Zurich ,  Winterthurerstrasse 190, CH-8057 Zurich ,  Switzerland."

Here we describe the role of myeloid-related protein Mrp14, a recently described amplifier of inflammation, in Alzheimer's disease and in the related amyloid precursor protein/presenilin1 (APP/PS1) mouse model. Detection of Mrp14 in control, mildly cognitive impaired, and AD patients revealed a strong induction of Mrp14 in protein extracts as well as in the cerebrospinal fluid, but not in blood plasma. In APP/PS1 mice, Mrp14 and its heterodimeric partner Mrp8 was found to be upregulated in microglial cells surrounding amyloid plaques. Functionally, loss of Mrp14 led to increased phagocytosis of fibrillar amyloid β (Aβ) in microglia cells in vitro and in vivo. Generating APP/PS1-transgenic mice deficient for Mrp14, we observed a decrease of key cytokines involved in APP processing, a reduction of BACE1 expression and activity, and consequently overall Aβ deposition. We therefore conclude that Mrp14 promotes APP processing and Aβ accumulation under neuroinflammatory conditions.","1529-2401","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","(32) 17824-9",2012,"Markus P","Kummer","MP","Clinical Neurosciences Unit, Department of Neurology, University of Bonn, 53105 Bonn, Germany."
23246577,"Effect of conjugated linoleic acid, μ-calpain inhibitor, on pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.","μ-Calpain is a calcium-dependent cysteine protease, which is activated by μM concentration of calcium in vitro. Disrupted intracellular calcium homeostasis leads to hyper-activation of μ-calpain. Hyper-activated μ-calpain enhances the accumulation of β-amyloid peptide by increasing the expression level of β-secretase (BACE1) and induces hyper-phosphorylation of tau along with the formation of neurofibrillary tangle by mediating p35 cleavage into p25, both of which are the major mechanisms of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Hence, inhibition of μ-calpain activity is very important in the treatment and prevention of AD. In this study, conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), an eighteen-carbon unsaturated fatty acid, was discovered as a μ-calpain-specific inhibitor. CLA showed neuroprotective effects against neurotoxins such as H2O2 and Aβ1-42 in SH-SY5Y cells, and inhibited Aβ oligomerization/fibrillation and Aβ-induced Zona Occludens-1 degradation. In addition, CLA decreased the levels of proapoptotic proteins, p35 conversion to p25 and tau phosphorylation. These findings implicate CLA as a new core structure for selective μ-calpain inhibitors with neuroprotective effects. CLA should be further evaluated for its potential use as an AD therapeutic agent.","0006-3002","Biochimica et biophysica acta","(1831) 709-18",2013,"Eunyoung","Lee","E","College of Pharmacy, Division of Life & Pharmaceutical Sciences, Ewha Womans University, Seoul, 120-750, Republic of Korea."
23257508,"Carnosic acid suppresses the production of amyloid-β 1-42 by inducing the metalloprotease gene TACE/ADAM17 in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells.","A hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the aggressive appearance of plaques of amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides, which result from the sequential cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the β- and γ-secretases. Aβ production is evaded by alternate cleavage of APP by the α- and γ-secretases. Carnosic acid (CA) has been proven to activate the transcription factor Nrf2, a main regulator of the antioxidant response. We investigated the effects of CA on the production of Aβ 1-42 peptide (Aβ42) and on the expressions of the related genes in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells. The treatment of cells with CA suppressed Aβ42 secretion (61% suppression at 30μM). CA treatment enhanced the mRNA expressions of an α-secretase TACE (tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme, also called a disintegrin and metalloproteinase-17, ADAM17) significantly and another α-secretase ADAM10 marginally; however, the β-secretase BACE1 (β-site APP-cleaving enzyme-1) was not increased by CA. Knockdown of TACE by siRNA reduced soluble-APPα secretion enhanced by CA and partially recovered the CA-suppressed Aβ42 secretion. These results suggest that CA reduces Aβ42 production by activating TACE without promoting BACE1 in human neuroblastoma cells. The use of CA may have a potential in the prevention of Aβ-mediated diseases, particularly AD.","1872-8111","Neuroscience research","(75) 94-102",2013,"Pengfei","Meng","P","Department of Vascular Biology, Institute of Brain Science, Hirosaki University Graduate School of Medicine, 5 Zaifu-cho, Hirosaki 036-8562, Japan."

Dysfunction of retromer is a risk factor for neurodegenerative disorders, but its function in developing mouse brain remains poorly understood. Here we provide evidence for VPS35 promoting dendritic growth and maturation, and axonal protein transport in developing mouse hippocampal neurons. Embryonic hippocampal CA1 neurons suppressing Vps35 expression by in utero electroporation of its micro RNAs displayed shortened apical dendrites, reduced dendritic spines, and swollen commissural axons in the neonatal stage, those deficits reflecting a defective protein transport/trafficking in developing mouse neurons. Further mechanistic studies showed that Vps35 depletion in neurons resulted in an impaired retrograde trafficking of BACE1 (β1-secretase) and altered BACE1 distribution. Suppression of BACE1 expression in CA1 neurons partially rescued both dendritic and axonal deficits induced by Vps35-deficiency. These results thus demonstrate that BACE1 acts as a critical cargo of retromer in vitro and in vivo, and suggest that VPS35 plays an essential role in regulating apical dendritic maturation and in preventing axonal spheroid formation in developing hippocampal neurons.","2046-6390","Biology open","(1) 1248-57",2012,"Chun-Lei","Wang","CL","Institute of Molecular Medicine and Genetics, and Department of Neurology, Medical College of Georgia, Georgia Health Sciences University ,  Augusta, GA 30912 ,  USA."
23269484,"Statins reduce amyloid β-peptide production by modulating amyloid precursor protein maturation and phosphorylation through a cholesterol-independent mechanism in cultured neurons.","Statins, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors, have been reported to attenuate amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) production in various cellular models. However, the mechanisms by which statins affect neuronal Aβ production have not yet been clarified. Here, we investigated this issue in rat primary cortical neurons using two statins, pitavastatin (PV) and atorvastatin (AV). Treatment of neurons with 0.2-2.5 μM PV or AV for 4 days induced a concentration- and time-dependent reduction in the secretion of both Aβ40 and Aβ42. Moreover, Western blot analyses of cell lysates showed that treatment with PV or AV significantly reduced expression levels of the mature form of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Thr668-phosphorylated APP (P-APP), but not immature form of APP; the decreases in P-APP levels were more notable than those of mature APP levels. The statin treatment did not alter expression of BACE1 (β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1) or γ-secretase complex proteins (presenilin 1, nicastrin, APH-1, and PEN-2). In neurons overexpressing APP via recombinant adenoviruses, PV or AV similarly reduced Aβ secretion and the levels of mature APP and P-APP. Statins also markedly reduced cellular cholesterol content in neurons in a concentration-dependent manner. Co-treatment with mevalonate reversed the statin-induced decreases in Aβ secretion and mature APP and P-APP levels, whereas co-treatment with cholesterol did not, despite recovery of cellular cholesterol levels. Finally, cell-surface biotinylation experiments revealed that both statins significantly reduced the levels of cell-surface P-APP without changing those of cell surface mature APP. These results suggest that statins reduce Aβ production by selectively modulating APP maturation and phosphorylation through a mechanism independent of cholesterol reduction in cultured neurons.","1573-6903","Neurochemical research","(38) 589-600",2013,"Ai","Hosaka","A","Department of Demyelinating Disease and Aging, National Institute of Neuroscience, NCNP, 4-1-1 Ogawahigashi, Kodaira, Tokyo, 187-8502, Japan."
23274884,"Leptin regulates amyloid β production via the γ-secretase complex.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common age-related neurodegenerative disease, affecting an estimated 5.3million people in the United States. While many factors likely contribute to AD progression, it is widely accepted that AD is driven by the accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ), a small, fibrillogenic peptide generated by the sequential proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein by the β- and γ-secretases. Though the underlying causes of Aβ accumulation in sporadic AD are myriad, it is clear that lifestyle and overall health play a significant role. The adipocyte-derived hormone leptin has varied systemic affects, including neuropeptide release and neuroprotection. A recent study by Lieb et al. (2009) showed that individuals with low plasma leptin levels are at greater risk of developing AD, through unknown mechanisms. In this report, we show that plasma leptin is a strong negative predictor of Aβ levels in the mouse brain, supporting a protective role for the hormone in AD onset. We also show that the inhibition of Aβ accumulation is due to the downregulation of transcription of the γ-secretase components. On the other hand, β-secretase expression is either unchanged (BACE1) or increased (BACE2). Finally, we show that only presenilin 1 (PS1) is negatively correlated with plasma leptin at the protein level (p<0.0001). These data are intriguing and may highlight a role for leptin in regulating the onset of amyloid pathology and AD.","0006-3002","Biochimica et biophysica acta","(1832) 439-44",2013,"Dana M","Niedowicz","DM","University of Kentucky, Lexington, KY 40536-0230, USA."

In the present work we aim to study the validity of an experimental model of neonatal chronic stress in order to recapitulate the main hallmarks of AD. Male Wistar rats that were separated daily from the dam during the first 3 weeks of life (maternal separation, MS) showed in adulthood cognitive deficits novel object recognition test. In the hippocampus of MS rats, increases in both Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels, the principal constituent of amyloid plaques observed in AD, were accompanied by increased expression of the cleaving enzyme BACE1. Hyperphosphorylation of Tau associated to increased activation of the tau kinase JNK1 was also found. Decreased cell number in the hippocampus was observed in stressed rats, as a consequence of both decreased cell proliferation and increased apoptotic death. Decreases in BDNF and in the synaptic markers synaptophysin and PSD-95 were also found in MS rats. All these effects could be related to an HPA axis hyperactivity, as reflected in significant increases in corticosterone levels and decreases in glucocorticoid receptor expression. Further, SHSY5Y neuroblastoma cells treated with corticosterone showed increased BACE1, pTau and pJNK1 expression. In addition, venlafaxine, an antidepressant able to modulate HPA axis activity, reversed all the above cited deleterious effects of chronic stress, both in vivo and in vitro.

23312803,"Nicotinamide riboside restores cognition through an upregulation of proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1α regulated β-secretase 1 degradation and mitochondrial gene expression in Alzheimer's mouse models.","Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)(+), a coenzyme involved in redox activities in the mitochondrial electron transport chain, has been identified as a key regulator of the lifespan-extending effects, and the activation of NAD(+) expression has been linked with a decrease in beta-amyloid (Aβ) toxicity in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nicotinamide riboside (NR) is a NAD(+) precursor, it promotes peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ coactivator 1 (PGC)-1α expression in the brain. Evidence has shown that PGC-1α is a crucial regulator of Aβ generation because it affects β-secretase (BACE1) degradation. In this study we tested the hypothesis that NR treatment in an AD mouse model could attenuate Aβ toxicity through the activation of PGC-1α-mediated BACE1 degradation. Using the Tg2576 AD mouse model, using in vivo behavioral analyses, biochemistry assays, small hairpin RNA (shRNA) gene silencing and electrophysiological recording, we found (1) dietary treatment of Tg2576 mice with 250 mg/kg/day of NR for 3 months significantly attenuates cognitive deterioration in Tg2576 mice and coincides with an increase in the steady-state levels of NAD(+) in the cerebral cortex; (2) application of NR to hippocampal slices (10 μM) for 4 hours abolishes the deficits in long-term potentiation recorded in the CA1 region of Tg2576 mice; (3) NR treatment promotes PGC-1α expression in the brain coinciding with enhanced degradation of BACE1 and the reduction of Aβ production in Tg2576 mice. Further in vitro studies confirmed that BACE1 protein content is decreased by NR treatment in primary neuronal cultures derived from Tg2576 embryos, in which BACE1 degradation was prevented by PGC-1α-shRNA gene silencing; and (4) NR treatment and PGC-1α overexpression enhance BACE1 ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Our studies suggest that dietary treatment with NR might benefit AD cognitive function and synaptic plasticity, in part by promoting PGC-1α-mediated BACE1 ubiquitination and degradation, thus preventing Aβ production in the brain.","1558-1497","Neurobiology of aging","(34) 1581-8",2013,"Bing","Gong","B","Department of Neurology, Center of Excellence for Novel Approaches to Neurotherapeutics, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, NY, USA."

BACE1 deficiency in mice causes hypomyelination during development and impairs remyelination if injured. In BACE1-null mice, the abolished cleavage of neuregulin-1 by BACE1 is speculated to cause reduced myelin sheath thickness in both the central nervous system and peripheral nervous system because reduced cleavage of Nrg-1 correlates with reduced Akt phosphorylation, a downstream signaling molecule of the Nrg-1/ErbB pathway. Here we tested specifically whether increasing Akt activity alone in oligodendrocytes would be sufficient to reverse the hypomyelination phenotype in BACE1-null mice. BACE1-null mice were bred with transgenic mice expressing constitutively active Akt (Akt-DD; mutations with D(308)T and D(473)S) in oligodendrocytes. Relative to littermate BACE1-null controls, BACE1(-/-)/Akt-DD mice exhibited enhanced expression of myelin basic protein and promoter of proteolipid protein. The elevated expression of myelin proteins correlated with a thicker myelin sheath in optic nerves; comparison of quantified g ratios with statistic significance was used to confirm this reversion. However, it appeared that myelin sheath thickness in the sciatic nerves was not increased in BACE1(-/-)/Akt-DD mice, as the g ratio was not significantly different from the control. Hence, increased Akt activity in BACE1-null myelinating cells only compensates for the loss of BACE1 activity in the central nervous system, which is consistent with the observation that overexpression of Akt-DD in Schwann cells did not induce hypermyelination. Our results suggest that signaling activity other than Akt may also contribute to proper myelination in peripheral nerves.","1530-6860","FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology","(27) 1868-73",2013,"Xiangyou","Hu","X","Department of Neurosciences, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA."

The formation of the gem-diol intermediate occurs with the barriers of 19.6 and 16.1 kcal/mol for the WT- and SW-substrate respectively. The QM/MM energetics predict that with the barriers of 21.9 and 17.2 kcal/mol for the WT- and SW-substrate respectively the cleavage of the peptide bond occurs in the rate-determining step. The computed barriers are in excellent agreement with the measured barrier of ∼18.0 kcal/mol for the SW-substrate and in line with the experimental observation that the cleavage of this substrate is sixty times more efficient than the WT-substrate.","1873-4243","Journal of molecular graphics & modelling","(40) 1-9",2013,"Arghya","Barman","A","Department of Chemistry, University of Miami, 1301 Memorial Drive, Coral Gables, FL 33146, USA."

Twelve brain regions including neocortical, limbic, and subcortical areas were dissected from brains of non-demented individuals and extracted according to increasing insolubility by a sequential three-step method. The levels of Aβ40, Aβ42, apoE, APP, APP-CTFβ, BACE1, presenilin-1, neprilysin, insulysin, LRP1, LDLR, synaptophysin, PSD95, GFAP, and lactate were determined by ELISAs or enzymatic assays. The regional distribution of apoE showed moderate-to-strong inverse correlation with levels of Aβ, especially insoluble Aβ40. On the other hand, the regional distributions of synaptic markers, particularly PSD95, showed moderate-to-strong positive correlation with levels of Aβ, especially soluble Aβ40. The regional correlations between Aβ and LRP1, GFAP, or lactate were mild-to-moderate. Moderate-to-strong positive regional correlations were observed between apoE and GFAP or lactate and between PSD95 and LRP1. No significant regional correlations were detected between Aβ and APP, APP-CTFβ, BACE1, or presenilin-1, those involved in Aβ production. There were no significant negative regional correlations between Aβ and two major Aβ degrading enzymes, neprilysin and insulysin. These regional correlations remained consistent regardless of the degree of Aβ accumulation.

In this study, we report the application of the de novo fragment-based molecular design program SPROUT to the discovery of a series of nonpeptide BACE1 inhibitors based upon a biphenylacetamide scaffold. The binding affinity of molecules based upon this designed molecular scaffold was increased from an initial BACE1 IC50 of 323 μM to 27 μM following the synthesis of a library of optimized ligands whose structures were refined using the recently developed SPROUT-HitOpt software. Although a number of inhibitors were found to exhibit cellular toxicity, one compound in the series was found to have useful BACE1 inhibitory activity in a cellular assay with minimal cellular toxicity. This work demonstrates the power of an in silico fragment-based molecular design approach in the discovery of novel BACE1 inhibitors.","1520-4804","Journal of medicinal chemistry","(56) 1843-52",2013,"N Yi","Mok","NY","School of Chemistry, University of Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, UK."
23386614,"Prion protein-mediated toxicity of amyloid-β oligomers requires lipid rafts and the transmembrane LRP1.","Soluble oligomers of the amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide cause neurotoxicity, synaptic dysfunction, and memory impairments that underlie Alzheimer disease (AD). The cellular prion protein (PrP(C)) was recently identified as a high affinity neuronal receptor for Aβ oligomers. We report that fibrillar Aβ oligomers recognized by the OC antibody, which have been shown to correlate with the onset and severity of AD, bind preferentially to cells and neurons expressing PrP(C). The binding of Aβ oligomers to cell surface PrP(C), as well as their downstream activation of Fyn kinase, was dependent on the integrity of cholesterol-rich lipid rafts. In SH-SY5Y cells, fluorescence microscopy and co-localization with subcellular markers revealed that the Aβ oligomers co-internalized with PrP(C), accumulated in endosomes, and subsequently trafficked to lysosomes. The cell surface binding, internalization, and downstream toxicity of Aβ oligomers was dependent on the transmembrane low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein-1 (LRP1). The binding of Aβ oligomers to cell surface PrP(C) impaired its ability to inhibit the activity of the β-secretase BACE1, which cleaves the amyloid precursor protein to produce Aβ. The green tea polyphenol (-)-epigallocatechin gallate and the red wine extract resveratrol both remodeled the fibrillar conformation of Aβ oligomers. The resulting nonfibrillar oligomers displayed significantly reduced binding to PrP(C)-expressing cells and were no longer cytotoxic. These data indicate that soluble, fibrillar Aβ oligomers bind to PrP(C) in a conformation-dependent manner and require the integrity of lipid rafts and the transmembrane LRP1 for their cytotoxicity, thus revealing potential targets to alleviate the neurotoxic properties of Aβ oligomers in AD.","1083-351X","The Journal of biological chemistry","(288) 8935-51",2013,"Jo V","Rushworth","JV","School of Molecular and Cellular Biology, Astbury Centre for Structural Molecular Biology, Faculty of Biological Sciences, University of Leeds, Leeds, LS2 9JT, United Kingdom."
23405115,"Long-term treatment of thalidomide ameliorates amyloid-like pathology through inhibition of β-secretase in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.","Thalidomide is a tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) inhibitor which has been found to have abilities against tumor growth, angiogenesis and inflammation. Recently, it has been applied in clinic for the treatment of multiple myeloma as well as some inflammatory diseases. However, whether thalidomide has any therapeutic effects on neurodegenerative disorders, i.e. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is not clear. AD is characterized by excessive amount of amyloid β peptides (Aβ), which results in a significant release of inflammatory factors, including TNFα in the brain. Studies have shown that inhibition of TNFα reduces amyloid-associated pathology, prevents neuron loss and improves cognition. Our recent report showed that genetic inhibition of TNFα/TNF receptor signal transduction down-regulates β amyloid cleavage enzyme 1 (BACE1) activity, reduces Aβ generation and improves learning and memory deficits. However, the mechanism of thalidomide involving in the mitigation of AD neuropathological features remains unclear. Here, we chronically administrated thalidomide on human APPswedish mutation transgenic (APP23) mice from 9 months old (an onset of Aβ deposits and early stage of AD-like changes) to 12 months old. We found that, in addition of dramatic decrease in the activation of both astrocytes and microglia, thalidomide significantly reduces Aβ load and plaque formation. Furthermore, we found a significant decrease in BACE1 level and activity with long-term thalidomide application. Interestingly, these findings cannot be observed in the brains of 12-month-old APP23 mice with short-term treatment of thalidomide (3 days). These results suggest that chronic thalidomide administration is an alternative approach for AD prevention and therapeutics.","1932-6203","PloS one","(8) e55091",2013,"Ping","He","P","Center for Advanced Therapeutic Strategies of Brain Disorders, Roskamp Institute, Sarasota, FL, USA."
23406323,"Loss of Bace2 in zebrafish affects melanocyte migration and is distinct from Bace1 knock out phenotypes.","Alzheimer's disease is the most frequent dementia. Pathologically, Alzheimer's disease is characterized by the accumulation of senile plaques composed of amyloid β-peptide (Aβ). Two proteases, β- and γ-secretase proteolytically generate Aβ from its precursor, the ß-amyloid precursor protein (APP). Inhibition of β-secretase, also referred to as beta-site APP cleaving enzyme (BACE1) or γ-secretase is therefore of prime interest for the development of amyloid-lowering drugs. To assess the in vivo function of zebrafish Bace1 (zBace1), we generated zBace1 knock out fish by zinc finger nuclease-mediated genome editing. bace1 mutants (bace1-/-) are hypomyelinated in the PNS while the CNS is not affected. Moreover, the number of mechanosensory neuromasts is elevated in bace1-/-. Mutations in zebrafish Bace2 (zBace2) revealed a distinct melanocyte migration phenotype, which is not observed in bace1-/-. Double homozygous bace1-/-; bace2-/- fish do not enhance the single mutant phenotypes indicating non-redundant distinct physiological functions. Single homozygous bace1 mutants as well as double homozygous bace1 and bace2 mutants are viable and fertile suggesting that Bace1 is a promising drug target without major side effects. The identification of a specific bace2 -/- associated phenotype further allows improving selective Bace1 inhibitors and to distinguish between Bace 1 and Bace 2 inhibition in vivo. Inhibition of BACE1 protease activity has therapeutic importance for Alzheimer's disease. Analysis of BACE1 and BACE2 knock-out zebrafish revealed that they exhibit distinct phenotypes. bace1 mutants display hypomyelination in the PNS and supernumerary neuromasts while in bace2 mutants the shape and migration of melanocytes is affected. These phenotypes are not further enhanced in the viable double mutants. Our data suggest that blocking BACE1 activity is a safe therapeutic approach.

Although meprins were discovered more than 30 years ago, their precise substrates and physiological roles have been elusive. Both enzymes were originally found to be highly expressed in kidney and intestine, which focused research on these particular tissues and associated pathologies. Only recently it has become evident that meprins exhibit a much broader expression pattern, implicating functions in angiogenesis, cancer, inflammation, fibrosis and neurodegenerative diseases. Different animal models, as well as proteomics approaches for the identification of protease substrates, have helped to reveal more precise molecular signalling events mediated by meprin activity, such as activation and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines. APP (amyloid precursor protein) is cleaved by meprin β in vivo, reminiscent of the β-secretase BACE1 (β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1). The subsequent release of Aβ (amyloid β) peptides is thought to be the major cause of the neurodegenerative Alzheimer's disease. On the other hand, ADAM10 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease domain 10), which is the constitutive α-secretase, was shown to be activated by meprin β, which is itself shed from the cell surface by ADAM10. In skin, both meprins are overexpressed in fibrotic tumours, characterized by massive accumulation of fibrillar collagens. Indeed, procollagen III is processed to its mature form by meprin α and meprin β, an essential step in collagen fibril assembly. The recently solved crystal structure of meprin β and the unique cleavage specificity of these proteases identified by proteomics will help to generate specific inhibitors that could be used as therapeutics to target meprins under certain pathological conditions.","1470-8728","The Biochemical journal","(450) 253-64",2013,"Claudia","Broder","C","Institute of Biochemistry, Unit for Degradomics of the Protease Web, University of Kiel, Rudolf-Höber-Str. 1, Kiel 24118, Germany."

23418065,"Consolidation of object recognition memory requires HRI kinase-dependent phosphorylation of eIF2α in the hippocampus.","Local control of protein synthesis at synapses is crucial for synaptic plasticity and memory formation. However, little is known about the signals coupling neurotransmitter release with the translational machinery during these processes. Here, we studied the involvement of heme-regulated inhibitor (HRI) kinase, a kinase activated by nitric oxide that phosphorylates eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α), in object recognition (OR) memory consolidation. Phosphorylated eIF2α mediates two opposing effects upon translation: translational arrest of most mRNAs and translational activation of selected mRNAs bearing specific features in their 5'untranslated regions (5'UTRs). We found that HRI kinase activation in the CA1 region of the dorsal hippocampus is necessary for retention of OR memory in rats. Accordingly, learning induced a transient increase in the phosphorylation state of eIF2α in dorsal CA1 which was abolished by the HRI kinase inhibitor N-(2,6-dimethylbenzyl)-6,7-dimethoxy-2H-[1]benzofuro[3,2-c]pyrazol-3-amine hydrochloride (AMI). The increase in p-eIF2α was associated with increased expression of BACE1 and activating transcription factor 4, two proteins containing eIF2α-responsive 5'UTRs in their mRNAs that play a key role in synaptic plasticity. Our data suggests that learning promotes the transient phosphorylation of eIF2α to allow for translation of specific 5'UTR-mRNAs through a process requiring HRI kinase activation.","1098-1063","Hippocampus","(23) 431-6",2013,"Gerard","ILL-Raga","G","Laboratory of Behavioral Neurobiology, Biomedical Research Institute, Pontifical Catholic University of Rio Grande do Sul (PUCRS), Porto Alegre, RS, Brazil."

Deficiency or pharmacological inhibition of the plasma membrane protease BACE2 enhances pancreatic β-cell function and proliferation, and therefore BACE2 is a putative target for the therapeutic intervention under conditions of β-cell loss and dysfunction. To gain a molecular understanding of BACE2 function, we performed a systematic and quantitative proteomic analysis to map the natural substrate repertoire of BACE2 and its homologue BACE1 in β-cells.

To this end, human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with siRNAs targeting the α7 nAChR subunit and/or exposed to Aβ1-42. For α7 nAChR, BACE1 (cleaving at the β-site of APP) and BACE2 (cleaving within the Aβ domain), α-secretase (ADAM10), and the two components of γ-secretase, PS and NCT, the mRNA and protein levels were determined by real-time PCR and Western blotting, respectively. The level of Aβ1-42 in the cell culture medium was determined by an ELISA procedure. The extent of lipid peroxidation and activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) were assayed spectrophotometrically. In the transfected SH-SY5Y cells, expression of α7 nAChR was reduced; the level of BACE1 increased and that of BACE2 decreased; the amount of ADAM10 lowered; and the level of PS raised. Moreover, the level of Aβ1-42 in the culture medium was elevated. Treatment of non-transfected cells with Aβ elevated the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) and lowered the activities of SOD and GSH-Px and these changes were potentiated by inhibiting expression of α7 nAChR. These results indicate that α7 nAChR plays a significant role in amyloidogenic metabolism of APP and the oxidative stress evoked by Aβ, suggesting that this receptor might help protect against the neurotoxicity of Aβ.","1573-6903","Neurochemical research","(38) 943-50",2013,"Xiao-Lan","Qi","XL","Department of Molecular Biology, Guiyang Medical University, Guiyang 550004, People's Republic of China."

A surface plasmon resonance- (SPR-) based method capable of continuously screening enzyme inhibitors at a single chip with antibody-amplified signal enhancement has been developed. The proof of concept is demonstrated by monitoring the cleavage of chip-confined peptide substrates [a segment of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) with the Swiss mutation] by β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1). In the presence of a noninhibitor, BACE1 clips the peptide substrate at the cleavage site, detaching a fragment that is homologous to the N-terminus of the amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide. Consequently, a subsequent injection of the Aβ antibody does not lead to any molecular recognition or SPR signal change at the chip. In contrast, suppression of the BACE1 activity by a strong inhibitor leaves the peptide substrate intact, and the subsequent antibody attachment produces an easily detectable SPR signal. Compared to the widely used FRET (fluorescence resonance energy transfer) assay, the method reported here is more cost-effective, as unlabeled peptide is used as the BACE1 substrate. Furthermore, the assay is faster (each screening cycle lasts for ca. 1.5 h) and can be continuously carried out at a single, regenerable SPR chip for more than 30 h. Consequently, excellent reproducibility (RSD < 5%) and throughput can be attained. Two inhibitors were screened, and their half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) determined by the SPR method were in excellent agreement with values deduced from ELISA and mass spectrometry.","1520-6882","Analytical chemistry","(85) 3660-6",2013,"Xinyao","Yi","X","College of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, P R China."

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) Aβ peptides are thought to derive from brain parenchyma and thus may serve as biomarkers for assessing cerebral amyloidosis and anti-Aβ efficacy. The present study compared active γ-secretase binding sites with Aβ deposition in aged and AD human cerebrum, and explored the possibility of Aβ production and secretion by the choroid plexus (CP). The specific binding density of [(3) H]-L-685,458, a radiolabeled high-affinity γ-secretase inhibitor, in the temporal neocortex and hippocampal formation was similar for AD and control cases with similar ages and post-mortem delays. The CP in post-mortem samples exhibited exceptionally high [(3) H]-L-685,458 binding density, with the estimated maximal binding sites (Bmax) reduced in the AD relative to control groups. Surgically resected human CP exhibited APP, BACE1 and presenilin-1 immunoreactivity, and β-site APP cleavage enzymatic activity. In primary culture, human CP cells also expressed these amyloidogenic proteins and released Aβ40 and Aβ42 into the medium. Overall, our results suggest that γ-secretase activity appears unaltered in the cerebrum in AD and is not correlated with regional amyloid plaque pathology. The CP appears to be a previously unrecognised non-neuronal contributor to CSF Aβ, probably at reduced levels in AD.","1460-9568","The European journal of neuroscience","(37) 1714-25",2013,"Fei","Liu","F","Department of Neurosurgery, The Third Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, Hunan, China."

FRET was found to depend on intracellular cholesterol levels and associated alterations in membrane stiffness. Here, NPC1 null cells (CHO-NPC1-/-), exhibiting increased cholesterol levels and disturbed cholesterol transport similar to that observed in Niemann-Pick type C disease (NPC), were used to analyze the influence of altered cholesterol levels on APP-BACE1 proximity. Fluorescence lifetime measurements of whole CHO-wild type (WT) and CHO-NPC1-/- cells (EPI-illumination microscopy), as well as their plasma membranes (total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, TIRFM), were performed. Additionally, generalized polarization (GP) measurements of CHO-WT and CHO-NPC1-/- cells incubated with the fluorescence marker laurdan were performed to determine membrane stiffness of plasma- and intracellular-membranes. CHO-NPC1-/- cells showed higher membrane stiffness at intracellular- but not plasma-membranes, equivalent to cholesterol accumulation in late endosomes/lysosomes. Along with higher membrane stiffness, the FRET efficiency between BACE1-GFP and APP-mRFP was reduced at intracellular membranes, but not within the plasma membrane of CHO-NPC1-/-.

In this study, we evaluated the effect of microRNA on memory impairment in rats induced by CBH. We show here that CBH generated by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (2VO) significantly decreased the learning and memory ability in rats, as assessed by Morris water maze, and upregulated expression of APP and BACE1 proteins in the hippocampus and cortex of rats, as evaluated by Western blot and immunofluorescence. In reciprocal, qRT-PCR analysis showed that microRNA-195 (miR-195) was downregulated in both the hippocampus and cortex of rats following CBH, and in the plasma of dementia patients. APP and BACE1 proteins were downregulated by miR-195 overexpression, upregulated by miR-195 inhibition, and unchanged by binding-site mutation or miR-masks, indicating that APP and BACE1 are two potential targets for miR-195. Knockdown of endogenous miR-195 by lentiviral vector-mediated overexpression of its antisense molecule (lenti-pre-AMO-miR-195) elicited dementia in rats, whereas overexpression of miR-195 using lenti-pre-miR-195 reduced dementia vulnerability triggered by 2VO. Additionally, chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis showed that NFκB was bound to the promoter region of miR-195 and inhibited its expression. We conclude that miR-195 may play a key role in determining dementia susceptibility in 2VO rats by regulating APP and BACE1 expression at the post-transcriptional level, and exogenous complement of miR-195 may be a potentially valuable anti-dementia approach.","1529-2401","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","(33) 3989-4001",2013,"Jing","Ai","J","Department of Pharmacology, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang Province, People's Republic of China, 150081. a.z.hrbmu@gmail.com"

Here, we provide a proteomic workflow for BACE1 substrate identification from whole brains, combining filter-aided sample preparation, strong-anion exchange fractionation, and label-free quantification. We used bace1-deficient zebrafish and quantified differences in protein levels between wild-type and bace1 -/- zebrafish brains. Over 4500 proteins were identified with at least two unique peptides and quantified in both wild-type and bace1 -/- zebrafish brains. The majority of zebrafish membrane proteins did not show altered protein levels, indicating that Bace1 has a restricted substrate specificity. Twenty-four membrane proteins accumulated in the bace1 -/- brains and thus represent candidate Bace1 substrates. They include several known BACE1 substrates, such as the zebrafish homologs of amyloid precursor protein and the cell adhesion protein L1, which validate the proteomic workflow. Additionally, several candidate substrates with a function in neurite outgrowth and axon guidance, such as plexin A3 and glypican-1 were identified, pointing to a function of Bace1 in neurodevelopment.

Of the most potent compounds, 9e displayed an IC50 value for BACE1 of 98 nM. Some of these derivatives demonstrated good inhibitory activity on Aβ production in N2a-APPswe cells at 5 and 10 μM. These compounds might be considered as promising BACE1 inhibitory agents that could lower Aβ production in AD.","1464-3391","Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry","(21) 2396-2412",2013,"Najmeh","Edraki","N","Department of Medicinal Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, and Pharmaceutical Sciences Research Center, Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran 14176, Iran; Medicinal and Natural Products Chemistry Research Center, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran."

We recently showed that these secretases also regulate the processing of voltage-gated sodium channel auxiliary β-subunits and thereby modulate membrane excitability. Here, we report that KCNE1 and KCNE2, auxiliary subunits of voltage-gated potassium channels, undergo sequential cleavage mediated by either α-secretase and PS/γ-secretase or BACE1 and PS/γ-secretase in cells. Elevated α-secretase or BACE1 activities increased C-terminal fragment (CTF) levels of KCNE1 and 2 in human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) and rat neuroblastoma (B104) cells. KCNE-CTFs were then further processed by PS/γ-secretase to KCNE intracellular domains. These KCNE cleavages were specifically blocked by chemical inhibitors of the secretases in the same cell models. We also verified our results in mouse cardiomyocytes and cultured primary neurons. Endogenous KCNE1- and KCNE2-CTF levels increased by 2- to 4-fold on PS/γ-secretase inhibition or BACE1 overexpression in these cells. Furthermore, the elevated BACE1 activity increased KCNE1 processing and shifted KCNE1/KCNQ1 channel activation curve to more positive potentials in HEK cells. KCNE1/KCNQ1 channel is a cardiac potassium channel complex, and the positive shift would lead to a decrease in membrane repolarization during cardiac action potential. Together, these results clearly showed that KCNE1 and KCNE2 cleavages are regulated by BACE1 and PS/γ-secretase activities under physiological conditions. Our results also suggest a functional role of KCNE cleavage in regulating voltage-gated potassium channels.","1530-6860","FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology","(27) 2458-67",2013,"Carolyn C","Sachse","CC","Neurobiology of Disease Laboratory, Genetics and Aging Research Unit, MassGeneral Institute for Neurodegenerative Disease, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Charlestown, MA 02129, USA."

Small-molecule BACE1 inhibitors of the hydroxyethylamine, hydantoin, and sulfamide classes were functionalized by biotin PEG linkers of varying lengths forming probes that were bound to streptavidin donor beads. BACE1 was coupled to nickel-chelate acceptor beads. Upon mixing, probes designed from all three classes registered high signal-to-background values in the AlphaScreen binding assay, where the interaction between probe and BACE1 was completely blocked by free parent compound. A probe from the hydantoin class was chosen for further optimization, where the final assay conditions of 50 nM BACE and 250 nM probe were used and Z(') values >0.75 were commonly observed. IC50 values determined by the AlphaScreen assay format exhibited ~10-fold greater sensitivity when compared with a fluorescence polarization-based activity assay.

Thirty-four subjects diagnosed with MCI and 45 subjects with AD were compared to 28 healthy elderly individuals for assessing for protein levels of APP, β-APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), presenilin 1 (PS1) and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase-10 (ADAM-10) by western blot, and for the enzyme activities of BACE1 and γ-secretase by using specific fluorogenic substrates, in samples of platelets. A similar pattern in the healthy elderly and MCI patients was found for BACE1 and PS1 levels. A reduction of APP levels in MCI and AD patients compared with healthy elderly individuals was found. Augmented levels of ADAM-10 in both MCI and AD were displayed in comparison with age-matched control subjects. The ratio ADAM-10/BACE1 was higher for the MCI group versus AD group. Whereas BACE1 and PS1 levels were only increased in AD regarding to controls, BACE1 and γ-secretase activities augmented significantly in both MCI and AD groups.

GNE-629 and GNE-892 concentrations and PD biomarkers including amyloid β (Aβ) in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and secreted APPβ (sAPPβ) and secreted APPα (sAPPα) in the CSF were measured after a single oral administration of GNE-629 (100 mg/kg) or GNE-892 (30 or 100 mg/kg) in cynomolgus monkeys. A mechanistic PK-PD model was developed to simultaneously characterize the plasma Aβ and CSF Aβ, sAPPα, and sAPPβ using GNE-629 in vivo data. This model was used to predict the in vivo effects of GNE-892 after adjustments based on differences in in vitro cellular activity and PK. The PK-PD model estimated GNE-629 CSF and free plasma IC₅₀ of 0.0033 μM and 0.065 μM, respectively. These differences in CSF and free plasma IC₅₀ suggest that different mechanisms are involved in Aβ formation in these two compartments. The predicted in vivo effects for GNE-892 using the PK-PD model were consistent with the observed data. In conclusion, a PK-PD model was developed to mechanistically describe the effects of BACE1 inhibition on Aβ, sAPPβ, and sAPPα in the CSF, and Aβ in the plasma.

To investigate the molecular mechanism of diabetic dementia, we induced type 2 diabetes in rats and examined potential changes in their cognitive functions and the neural morphology of the brains. We found that the diabetic rats with an impairment of spatial learning and memory showed the occurrence of RTN3-immunoreactive dystrophic neurites in the cortex. Biochemical examinations revealed the increase of a high molecular weight form of RTN3 (HW-RTN3) in diabetic brains. The corresponding decrease of monomeric RTN3 was correlated with the reduction of its inhibitory effects on the activity of β-secretase (BACE1), a key enzyme for generation of β-amyloid peptides. The results from immunoprecipitation combined with protein carbonyl detection showed that carbonylated RTN3 was significantly higher in cortical tissues of diabetic rats compared with control rats, indicating that diabetes-induced oxidative stress led to RTN3 oxidative damage. In neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells, high glucose and/or H2O2 treatment significantly increased the amounts of carbonylated proteins and HW-RTN3, whereas monomeric RTN3 was reduced. Hence, we conclude that diabetes-induced cognitive deficits and central neuritic dystrophy are correlated with the formation of aggregated RTN3 via oxidative stress. We provided the first evidence that oxidative damage caused the formation of toxic RTN3 aggregates, which participated in the pathogenesis of central neuritic dystrophy in diabetic brain.

BACE1, which is elevated in AD patients and APP transgenic mice, also cleaves the β2-subunit of voltage-gated sodium channels (Navβ2). Although increased BACE1 levels are associated with Navβ2 cleavage in AD patients, whether Navβ2 cleavage occurs in APP mice had not yet been examined. Such a finding would be of interest because of its potential impact on neuronal activity: previous studies demonstrated that BACE1-overexpressing mice exhibit excessive cleavage of Navβ2 and reduced sodium current density, but the phenotype associated with loss of function mutations in either Navβ-subunits or pore-forming α-subunits is epilepsy. Because mounting evidence suggests that epileptiform activity may play an important role in the development of AD-related cognitive deficits, we examined whether enhanced cleavage of Navβ2 occurs in APP transgenic mice, and whether it is associated with aberrant neuronal activity and cognitive deficits. We found increased levels of BACE1 expression and Navβ2 cleavage fragments in cortical lysates from APP transgenic mice, as well as associated alterations in Nav1.1α expression and localization. Both pyramidal neurons and inhibitory interneurons exhibited evidence of increased Navβ2 cleavage. Moreover, the magnitude of alterations in sodium channel subunits was associated with aberrant EEG activity and impairments in the Morris water maze. Together, these results suggest that altered processing of voltage-gated sodium channels may contribute to aberrant neuronal activity and cognitive deficits in AD.","1529-2401","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","(33) 7020-6",2013,"Brian F","Corbett","BF","Department of Neuroscience and Farber Institute for Neurosciences, Thomas Jefferson University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19107, USA."

Previous reports, by us and others, have indicated that the levels of BACE1 protein and activity are increased in the brain cortex of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). The association between oxidative stress (OS) and AD has prompted investigations that support the potentiation of BACE1 expression and enzymatic activity by OS. Here, we have established conditions to analyse the effects of mild, non-lethal OS on BACE1 in primary neuronal cultures, independently from apoptotic mechanisms that were shown to impair BACE1 turnover. Six-hour treatment of mouse primary cortical cells with 10-40 µM hydrogen peroxide did not significantly compromise cell viability but it did produce mild oxidative stress (mOS), as shown by the increased levels of reactive radical species and activation of p38 stress kinase. The endogenous levels of BACE1 mRNA and protein were not significantly altered in these conditions, whereas a toxic H2O2 concentration (100 µM) caused an increase in BACE1 protein levels. Notably, mOS conditions resulted in increased levels of the BACE1 C-terminal cleavage product of APP, β-CTF. Subcellular fractionation techniques showed that mOS caused a major rearrangement of BACE1 localization from light to denser fractions, resulting in an increased distribution of BACE1 in fractions containing APP and markers for trans-Golgi network and early endosomes. Collectively, these data demonstrate that mOS does not modify BACE1 expression but alters BACE1 subcellular compartmentalization to favour the amyloidogenic processing of APP, and thus offer new insight in the early molecular events of AD pathogenesis.","1932-6203","PloS one","(8) e61246",2013,"Jiang-Li","Tan","JL","Department of Pathology, The University of Melbourne, Parkville, Australia."

Here, by using immunocytochemistry, immunoblotting, enzymatic assays, and highly sensitive sandwich ELISA kits, we investigated the effects of fAβ25-35 and soluble (s)Aβ25-35 on Aβ42 and Aβ40 accumulation/secretion by human cortical astrocytes and HCN-1A neurons and, since the calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) binds Aβs, their modulation by NPS 2143, a CaSR allosteric antagonist (calcilytic). The fAβ25-35-exposed astrocytes and surviving neurons produced, accumulated, and secreted increased amounts of Aβ42, while Aβ40 also accrued but its secretion was unchanged. Accordingly, secreted Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio values rose for astrocytes and neurons. While slightly enhancing Aβ40 secretion by fAβ25-35-treated astrocytes, NPS 2143 specifically suppressed the fAβ25-35-elicited surges of endogenous Aβ42 secretion by astrocytes and neurons. Therefore, NPS 2143 addition always kept Aβ42/Aβ40 values to baseline or lower levels. Mechanistically, NPS 2143 decreased total CaSR protein complement, transiently raised proteasomal chymotrypsin activity, and blocked excess NO production without affecting the ongoing increases in BACE1/β-secretase and γ-secretase activity in fAβ25-35-treated astrocytes. Compared to fAβ25-35, sAβ25-35 also stimulated Aβ42 secretion by astrocytes and neurons and NPS 2143 specifically and wholly suppressed this effect. Therefore, since NPS 2143 thwarts any Aβ/CaSR-induced surplus secretion of endogenous Aβ42 and hence further vicious cycles of Aβ self-induction/secretion/spreading, calcilytics might effectively prevent/stop the progression to full-blown AD.

Nevertheless, there are limited data on the therapeutic properties including safety liabilities that will enable successful development of TfR-based therapeutics. We evaluate TfR/BACE1 bispecific antibody variants in mouse and show that reducing TfR binding affinity improves not only brain uptake but also peripheral exposure and the safety profile of these antibodies. We identify and seek to address liabilities of targeting TfR with antibodies, namely, acute clinical signs and decreased circulating reticulocytes observed after dosing. By eliminating Fc effector function, we ameliorated the acute clinical signs and partially rescued a reduction in reticulocytes. Furthermore, we show that complement mediates a residual decrease in reticulocytes observed after Fc effector function is eliminated. These data raise important safety concerns and potential mitigation strategies for the development of TfR-based therapies that are designed to cross the blood-brain barrier.","1946-6242","Science translational medicine","(5) 183ra57, 1-12",2013,"Jessica A","Couch","JA","Development Sciences, Genentech Inc., 1 DNA Way, South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA."
23637177,"Dual cleavage of neuregulin 1 type III by BACE1 and ADAM17 liberates its EGF-like domain and allows paracrine signaling.","Proteolytic shedding of cell surface proteins generates paracrine signals involved in numerous signaling pathways. Neuregulin 1 (NRG1) type III is involved in myelination of the peripheral nervous system, for which it requires proteolytic activation by proteases of the ADAM family and BACE1. These proteases are major therapeutic targets for the prevention of Alzheimer's disease because they are also involved in the proteolytic generation of the neurotoxic amyloid β-peptide. Identification and functional investigation of their physiological substrates is therefore of greatest importance in preventing unwanted side effects. Here we investigated proteolytic processing of NRG1 type III and demonstrate that the ectodomain can be cleaved by three different sheddases, namely ADAM10, ADAM17, and BACE1. Surprisingly, we not only found cleavage by ADAM10, ADAM17, and BACE1 C-terminal to the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain, which is believed to play a pivotal role in signaling, but also additional cleavage sites for ADAM17 and BACE1 N-terminal to that domain. Proteolytic processing at N- and C-terminal sites of the EGF-like domain results in the secretion of this domain from NRG1 type III. The soluble EGF-like domain is functionally active and stimulates ErbB3 signaling in tissue culture assays. Moreover, the soluble EGF-like domain is capable of rescuing hypomyelination in a zebrafish mutant lacking BACE1. Our data suggest that NRG1 type III-dependent myelination is not only controlled by membrane-retained NRG1 type III, but also in a paracrine manner via proteolytic liberation of the EGF-like domain.","1529-2401","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","(33) 7856-69",2013,"Daniel","Fleck","D","Adolf-Butenandt-Institute, Biochemistry, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, 80336 Munich, Germany."
23658180,"Elevation of brain magnesium prevents and reverses cognitive deficits and synaptic loss in Alzheimer's disease mouse model.","Profound synapse loss is one of the major pathological hallmarks associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and might underlie memory impairment. Our previous work demonstrated that the magnesium ion is a critical factor in controlling synapse density/plasticity. Here, we investigated whether elevation of brain magnesium by the use of a recently developed compound, magnesium-l-threonate (MgT), can ameliorate the AD-like pathologies and cognitive deficits in the APPswe/PS1dE9 mice, a transgenic (Tg) mouse model of AD. MgT treatment reduced Aβ plaque and prevented synapse loss and memory decline in the Tg mice. Strikingly, MgT treatment was effective even when given to the mice at the end stage of their AD-like pathological progression. To explore how elevation of brain magnesium ameliorates the AD-like pathologies in the brains of Tg mice, we studied molecules critical for APP metabolism and signaling pathways implicated in synaptic plasticity/density. In the Tg mice, the NMDAR/CREB/BDNF signaling was downregulated, whereas calpain/calcineurin/Cdk5 neurodegenerative signaling and β-secretase (BACE1) expression were upregulated. MgT treatment prevented the impairment of these signaling pathways, stabilized BACE1 expression, and reduced soluble APPβ and β-C-terminal fragments in the Tg mice. At the molecular level, elevation of extracellular magnesium prevented the high-Aβ-induced reductions in synaptic NMDARs by preventing calcineurin overactivation in hippocampal slices. Correlation studies suggested that the protection of NMDAR signaling might underlie the stabilization of BACE1 expression. Our results suggest that elevation of brain magnesium exerts substantial synaptoprotective effects in a mouse model of AD and may have therapeutic potential for treating AD in humans.","1529-2401","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","(33) 8423-41",2013,"Wei","Li","W","Tsinghua-Peking Center for Life Sciences, School of Medicine, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China."

We have investigated the capacity of several medicinal mushroom species-Auricularia polytricha (wood ear mushroom), Agaricus bisporus (button mushroom), Flammulina velutipes (winter or enoki mushroom), and Lentinus edodes (shiitake mushroom)-in the regulation of BACE1. Mushrooms were subjected to a generic food-compatible processing method to detect process-stable or process-modified products; the effects of processing were interpreted to infer the chemical classes associated with bioactivity. We have shown previously that in addition to enzyme inhibition, in the presence of the BACE1 proenzyme, heteropolymeric species such as heparin can activate BACE1 by modulating access to the catalytic site. We observed both inhibitory and activating components of the various mushrooms. Only BACE1 inhibitory species were detected in unprocessed and processed forms of A. polytricha, whereas the dominant extracted species from A. bisporus, F. velutipes, and L. edodese were activators of BACE1. It is not known whether activating species were masking the presence of inhibitory species in A. bisporus, F. velutipes, and L. edodes. Inhibitory species were attributed to hispidin-derived polyphenols, whereas activating species were attributed to soluble polysaccharides and possibly low-mass Maillard products produced during processing.

Up- or downregulation of PGC-1α reciprocally regulated BACE1 in vitro and in vivo. Modest fasting in mice reduced BACE1 transcription in the brains, which was accompanied by elevated PGC-1 expression and activity. Moreover, the suppressive effect of PGC-1 was dependent on activated PPARγ, likely via SIRT1-mediated deacetylation in a ligand-independent manner. The BACE1 promoter contains multiple PPAR-RXR sites, and direct interactions among SIRT1-PPARγ-PGC-1 at these sites were enhanced with fasting.

Deletion of N-terminal cytoplasmic or C-terminal extracellular sequences of BRI2 neither affected its interaction with BACE1 or APP (Fotinopoulou et al., 2005) nor the reduction in the levels of BACE1 and sAPPβ.

In-vitro knock-down of LRRTM3 was previously shown to decrease secreted Aβ, although the mechanism of this is unclear. In SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing APP and transiently transfected with LRRTM3 alone or with BACE1, we showed that LRRTM3 co-localizes with both APP and BACE1 in early endosomes, where BACE1 processing of APP occurs. Additionally, LRRTM3 co-localizes with APP in primary neuronal cultures from Tg2576 mice transduced with LRRTM3-expressing adeno-associated virus. Moreover, LRRTM3 co-immunoprecipitates with both endogenous APP and overexpressed BACE1, in HEK293T cells transfected with LRRTM3. SH-SY5Y cells with knock-down of LRRTM3 had lower BACE1 and higher CTNNA3 mRNA levels, but no change in APP. Brain mRNA levels of LRRTM3 showed significant correlations with BACE1, CTNNA3 and APP in ∼400 humans, but not in LRRTM3 knock-out mice. Finally, we assessed 69 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within and flanking LRRTM3 in 1,567 LOADs and 2,082 controls and identified 8 SNPs within a linkage disequilibrium block encompassing 5'UTR-Intron 1 of LRRTM3 that formed multilocus genotypes (MLG) with suggestive global association with LOAD risk (p = 0.06), and significant individual MLGs. These 8 SNPs were genotyped in an independent series (1,258 LOADs and 718 controls) and had significant global and individual MLG associations in the combined dataset (p = 0.02-0.05).

Formation of pathological and functional amyloidogenic substrates can require precursor processing by proteases, as exemplified by the generation of Aβ peptide from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta-site APP cleaving enzyme (BACE)1 and γ-secretase. Proteolytic processing of the pigment cell-specific Melanocyte Protein (PMEL) is also required to form functional amyloid fibrils during melanogenesis, but the enzymes involved are incompletely characterized. Here we show that the BACE1 homologue BACE2 processes PMEL to generate functional amyloids. BACE2 is highly expressed in pigment cells and Bace2(-/-) but not Bace1(-/-) mice display coat color defects, implying a specific role for BACE2 during melanogenesis. By using biochemical and morphological analyses, combined with RNA silencing, pharmacologic inhibition, and BACE2 overexpression in a human melanocytic cell line, we show that BACE2 cleaves the integral membrane form of PMEL within the juxtamembrane domain, releasing the PMEL luminal domain into endosomal precursors for the formation of amyloid fibrils and downstream melanosome morphogenesis. These studies identify an amyloidogenic substrate of BACE2, reveal an important physiological role for BACE2 in pigmentation, and highlight analogies in the generation of PMEL-derived functional amyloids and APP-derived pathological amyloids.

In this study, we found that Aβ Glu11 is the major β-secretase site for cleavage of APP by BACE1 to generate soluble secreted APP (sAPPβ)(606) and the C-terminal membrane-bound fragment (CTF)β product C89. Cleavage of C89 by γ-secretase resulted in truncated Aβ generation in a non-amyloidogenic pathway. A familial AD-associated Swedish APP mutation adjacent to Aβ Asp1 shifted the major APP β-secretase cleavage site from Aβ Glu11 to Asp1, resulting in significant increases in sAPPβ596 and CTFβ C99 generation and the C99/89 ratio, in turn leading to increased Aβ production in cultured cells in vitro and transgenic AD model mouse brains in vivo. Furthermore, increased BACE1 expression facilitated APP being processed by the β-secretase processing pathway rather than the α-secretase pathway, leading to more Aβ production. Our results suggest that potentiating BACE1 cleavage of APP at both the Asp1 and Glu11 sites, or shifting the cleavage from the Glu11 site to the Asp1 site, could result in increased Aβ production and facilitate neuritic plaque formation. Our study provides new insights into how alteration of BACE1 expression and β-secretase cleavage site selection could contribute to Alzheimer pathogenesis and the pharmaceutical potential of modulating BACE1 expression and its cleavage site selection.","1460-9568","The European journal of neuroscience","(37) 1962-9",2013,"Yu","Deng","Y","Department of Psychiatry, Townsend Family Laboratories, Brain Research Center, Graduate Program in Neuroscience, The University of British Columbia, 2255 Wesbrook Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z3, Canada."
23773066,"BACE2 degradation mediated by the macroautophagy-lysosome pathway.","Neuritic plaque is the pathological hallmark in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid-β protein (Aβ), the central component of neuritic plaques, is generated from amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) by β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and γ-secretase. β-site APP cleaving enzyme 2 (BACE2), a homolog of BACE1, functions differently from BACE1 in APP processing. BACE1 is the β-secretase essential for Aβ production, and BACE2, a θ-secretase, cleaves APP within the Aβ domain, preventing Aβ production. Elucidation of the mechanism underlying BACE2 degradation is important for defining its biological features and its potential role in Alzheimer's disease drug development. In this report we first showed that the half-life of BACE2 is approximately 20 h. Lysosomal inhibition increased BACE2 protein levels whereas proteasomal inhibition had no effect on BACE2 protein expression. Furthermore, we identified that macroautophagy mediated BACE2 degradation. Finally, we showed that lysosomal inhibition increased BACE2 cleavage of APP. Taken together, our in vitro study showed that BACE2 is degraded through the macrophagy-lysosome pathway and that lysosomal inhibition affects BACE2 processing of APP.

Substantive evidence indicates that APP processing by BACE1 is dependent on intracellular sorting of this enzyme. Nonetheless, knowledge of the intracellular trafficking pathway of internalised BACE1 remains in doubt. Here we show that cell surface BACE1 is rapidly internalised by the AP2/clathrin dependent pathway in transfected cells and traffics to early endosomes and Rab11-positive, juxtanuclear recycling endosomes, with very little transported to the TGN as has been previously suggested. Moreover, BACE1 is predominantly localised to the early and recycling endosome compartments in different cell types, including neuronal cells. In contrast, the majority of internalised wild-type APP traffics to late endosomes/lysosomes. To explore the relevance of the itinerary of BACE1 on APP processing, we generated a BACE1 chimera containing the cytoplasmic tail of TGN38 (BACE/TGN38), which cycles between the cell surface and TGN in an AP2-dependent manner. Wild-type BACE1 is less efficient in Aβ production than the BACE/TGN38 chimera, highlighting the relevance of the itinerary of BACE1 on APP processing. Overall the data suggests that internalised BACE1 and APP diverge at early endosomes and that Aβ biogenesis is regulated in part by the recycling itinerary of BACE1.

The key step in the generation of Aβ is cleavage of APP by beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1). Levels of BACE1 are increased in vulnerable regions of the AD brain, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. In the present study, we reported the effects of ferrous ions at subtoxic concentrations on the mRNA levels of BACE1 and a-disintegrin-and-metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10) in PC12 cells and the cell responses to ferrous ions. The cell survival in PC12 cells significantly decreased with 0 to 0.3 mM FeCl2, with 0.6 mM FeCl2 treatment resulting in significant reductions by about 75%. 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) staining showed that the nuclei appeared fragmented in 0.2 and 0.3 mM FeCl2. APP-α-carboxyl terminal fragment (APP-α-CTF) associations with ADAM10 and APP-β-CTF with BACE1 were increased. Levels of ADAM10 and BACE1 mRNA increased in response to the concentrations of 0.25 mM, respectively. In addition, p-ERK and p-Bad (S112, S155) expressions were increased, suggesting that APP-CTF formation is related to ADAM10/BACE1 expression. Levels of Bcl-2 protein were increased, but significant changes were not observed in the expression of Bax. These data suggest that ion-induced enhanced expression of AMDA10/BACE1 could be one of the causes for APP-α/β-CTF activation.","1226-4512","The Korean journal of physiology & pharmacology : official journal of the Korean Physiological Society and the Korean Society of Pharmacology","(17) 189-95",2013,"Chi Hyun","Kim","CH","Department of Biomedical Engineering, College of Health Science, Yonsei University, Wonju 220-710, Korea."

Unlike rats and mice, guinea pigs possess an Aβ peptide sequence identical to human Aβ. Consistent with the commonality between cardiovascular and AD risk factors in humans, we saw that a high cholesterol diet leads to up-regulation of BACE1 (β-secretase) transcription and down-regulation of ADAM10 (α-secretase) transcription which should increase release of Aβ from APP. Significantly, guinea pigs possess isoforms of AD-related genes found in humans but not present in mice or rats. For example, we discovered that the truncated PS2V isoform of human PSEN2, that is found at raised levels in AD brains and that increases γ-secretase activity and Aβ synthesis, is not uniquely human or aberrant as previously believed. We show that PS2V formation is up-regulated by hypoxia and a high-cholesterol diet while, consistent with observations in humans, Aβ concentrations are raised in some brain regions but not others. Also like humans, but unlike mice, the guinea pig gene encoding tau, MAPT, encodes isoforms with both three and four microtubule binding domains, and cholesterol alters the ratio of these isoforms. We conclude that AD-related genes are highly conserved and more similar to human than the rat or mouse. Guinea pigs represent a superior rodent model for analysis of the impact of dietary factors such as cholesterol on the regulation of AD-related genes.","1932-6203","PloS one","(8) e66235",2013,"Mathew J","Sharman","MJ","Centre of Excellence for Alzheimer's Disease Research and Care, School of Medical Sciences, Edith Cowan University, Perth, WA, Australia ; School of Human Life Sciences, University of Tasmania, Launceston, Tasmania, Australia."

BACE1 levels are increased in AD, which could contribute to pathogenesis, yet the mechanism of BACE1 elevation is unclear. Furthermore, the normal function of BACE1 is poorly understood. We localized BACE1 in the brain at both the light and electron microscopic levels to gain insight into normal and pathophysiologic roles of BACE1 in health and AD, respectively. Our findings provide the first ultrastructural evidence that BACE1 localizes to vesicles (likely endosomes) in normal hippocampal mossy fiber terminals of both non-transgenic and APP transgenic (5XFAD) mouse brains. In some instances, BACE1-positive vesicles were located near active zones, implying a function for BACE1 at the synapse. In addition, BACE1 accumulated in swollen dystrophic autophagosome-poor presynaptic terminals surrounding amyloid plaques in 5XFAD cortex and hippocampus. Importantly, accumulations of BACE1 and APP co-localized in presynaptic dystrophies, implying increased BACE1 processing of APP in peri-plaque regions. In primary cortical neuron cultures, treatment with the lysosomal protease inhibitor leupeptin caused BACE1 levels to increase; however, exposure of neurons to the autophagy inducer trehalose did not reduce BACE1 levels. This suggests that BACE1 is degraded by lysosomes but not by autophagy. Our results imply that BACE1 elevation in AD could be linked to decreased lysosomal degradation of BACE1 within dystrophic presynaptic terminals. Elevated BACE1 and APP levels in plaque-associated presynaptic dystrophies could increase local peri-plaque Aβ generation and accelerate amyloid plaque growth in AD.

23825420,"Palmitoylation of amyloid precursor protein regulates amyloidogenic processing in lipid rafts.","Brains of patients affected by Alzheimer's disease (AD) contain large deposits of aggregated amyloid β-protein (Aβ). Only a small fraction of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gives rise to Aβ. Here, we report that ∼10% of APP undergoes a post-translational lipid modification called palmitoylation. We identified the palmitoylation sites in APP at Cys¹⁸⁶ and Cys¹⁸⁷. Surprisingly, point mutations introduced into these cysteines caused nearly complete ER retention of APP. Thus, either APP palmitoylation or disulfide bridges involving these Cys residues appear to be required for ER exit of APP. In later compartments, palmitoylated APP (palAPP) was specifically enriched in lipid rafts. In vitro BACE1 cleavage assays using cell or mouse brain lipid rafts showed that APP palmitoylation enhanced BACE1-mediated processing of APP. Interestingly, we detected an age-dependent increase in endogenous mouse brain palAPP levels. Overexpression of selected DHHC palmitoyl acyltransferases increased palmitoylation of APP and doubled Aβ production, while two palmitoylation inhibitors reduced palAPP levels and APP processing. We have found previously that acyl-coenzyme A:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) inhibition led to impaired APP processing. Here we demonstrate that pharmacological inhibition or genetic inactivation of ACAT decrease lipid raft palAPP levels by up to 76%, likely resulting in impaired APP processing. Together, our results indicate that APP palmitoylation enhances amyloidogenic processing by targeting APP to lipid rafts and enhancing its BACE1-mediated cleavage. Thus, inhibition of palAPP formation by ACAT or specific palmitoylation inhibitors would appear to be a valid strategy for prevention and/or treatment of AD.","1529-2401","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","(33) 11169-83",2013,"Raja","Bhattacharyya","R","Department of Neurology, MassGeneral Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Charlestown, Massachusetts 02129, USA."

We show that shedding of Jag1 is reduced in BACE1 null mice and upregulated Jag1 enhances Notch signaling via cell-cell juxtacrine interactions. Additional biochemical assays confirmed that overexpression of BACE1 enhanced cleavage of Jag1. Consequently, BACE1 null mice exhibit a significant increase in astrogenesis with a corresponding decrease in neurogenesis in their hippocampi during early development. Hence, BACE1 appears to function as a signaling protease that controls the balance of neurogenesis and astrogenesis via the Jag1-Notch pathway.

This review describes the essential role of quantum chemical interactions via the arginine side chain in the mechanism of BACE1 inhibition, and proposes an ""electron donor/acceptor bioisostere"" concept for medicinal science based on quantum chemical interactions.

Disease-modifying therapies that are currently being pursued are based on the amyloid cascade theory. This states that accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) in the brain triggers a cascade of cellular events leading to neurodegeneration. Aβ, which is the major constituent of amyloid plaques, is a peptidic fragment derived from proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by sequential cleavages that involve β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and γ-secretase. Targeting BACE1 is a rational approach as its cleavage of APP is the rate-limiting step in Aβ production and this enzyme is elevated in the brain of patients with AD. Furthermore, knocking out the BACE1 gene in mice showed little apparent consequences. Ten years of intensive research has led to the design of efficacious BACE1 inhibitors with favorable pharmacological properties. Several drug candidates have shown promising results in animal models, as they reduce amyloid plaque pathology in the brain and rescue cognitive deficits. Phase I clinical trials indicate that these drugs are well tolerated, and the results from further trials in AD patients are now awaited eagerly. Yet, recent novel information on BACE1 biology, and the discovery that BACE1 cleaves a selection of substrates involved in myelination, retinal homeostasis, brain circuitry, and synaptic function, alert us to potential side effects of BACE1 inhibitors that will require further evaluation to provide a safe therapy for AD.

However, recent evidence raises concern that BACE1-inhibiting approaches may encounter dramatic declines in their abilities to ameliorate AD-like pathology and memory deficits during disease progression. Here, we used BACE1 haploinsufficiency as a therapeutic relevant model to evaluate the efficacy of partial inhibition of this enzyme. Specifically, we crossed BACE1(+/-) mice with 5XFAD transgenic mice and investigated the mechanisms by which Aβ accumulation and related memory impairments become less sensitive to rescue by BACE1(+/-) reduction. Haploinsufficiency lowered BACE1 expression by ∼50% in 5XFAD mice regardless of age in concordance with reduction in gene copy number. However, profound Aβ plaque pathology and memory deficits concomitant with BACE1 equivalent to wild-type control levels remained in BACE1(+/-)·5XFAD mice with advanced age (15-18 months old). Therefore, BACE1 haploinsufficiency is not sufficient to block the elevation of BACE1 expression (approximately twofold), which is also reported to occur during human AD progression, in 5XFAD mice. Our investigation revealed that PERK (PKR-endoplasmic reticulum-related kinase)-dependent activation of eIF2α (eukaryotic translation initiation factor-2α) accounts for the persistent BACE1 upregulation in BACE1(+/-)·5XFAD mouse brains at 15-18 months of age. Moreover, BACE1 haploinsufficiency was also no longer able to prevent reduction in the expression of neprilysin, a crucial Aβ-degrading enzyme, in 5XFAD mice with advanced age. These findings demonstrate that partial BACE1 suppression cannot attenuate deleterious BACE1-elevating or neprilysin-reducing mechanisms, limiting its capabilities to reduce cerebral Aβ accumulation and rescue memory defects during the course of AD development.

HPBD inhibited LPS-induced NO and ROS production, and LPS-elevated expression of iNOS, COX2, β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), C99, and Aβ1-42 levels as well as attenuation of β-secretase activities. The activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-κB), signal transducer and activator of transcription1 (STAT1), and STAT3 was concomitantly inhibited by HPBD. Moreover, siRNA targeting STAT3 abolished HPBD-induced inhibitory effects on neuro-inflammation and amyloidogenesis. In addition, pull down assay and docking model showed interaction of HPBD with STAT3. These findings suggest that HPBD may be useful and potentially therapeutic choices for the treatment of neuroinflammatory diseases.

Therefore, the identification of molecules that regulate Aβ generation is crucial for future therapeutic approaches for AD. We demonstrated previously that RanBP9 regulates Aβ generation in a number of cell lines and primary neuronal cultures by forming tripartite protein complexes with APP, low-density lipoprotein-related protein, and BACE1, consequently leading to increased amyloid plaque burden in the brain. RanBP9 is a scaffold protein that exists and functions in multiprotein complexes. To identify other proteins that may bind RanBP9 and regulate Aβ levels, we used a two-hybrid analysis against a human brain cDNA library and identified COPS5 as a novel RanBP9-interacting protein. This interaction was confirmed by coimmunoprecipitation experiments in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells and mouse brain. Colocalization of COPS5 and RanBP9 in the same subcellular compartments further supported the interaction of both proteins. Furthermore, like RanBP9, COPS5 robustly increased Aβ generation, followed by increased soluble APP-β (sAPP-β) and decreased soluble-APP-α (sAPP-α) levels. Most importantly, down-regulation of COPS5 by siRNAs reduced Aβ generation, implying that endogenous COPS5 regulates Aβ generation. Finally, COPS5 levels were increased significantly in AD brains and APΔE9 transgenic mice, and overexpression of COPS5 strongly increased RanBP9 protein levels by increasing its half-life. Taken together, these results suggest that COPS5 increases Aβ generation by increasing RanBP9 levels. Thus, COPS5 is a novel RanBP9-binding protein that increases APP processing and Aβ generation by stabilizing RanBP9 protein levels.

The continuous research in this field has contributed to delineate AD as a multifactorial syndrome with several biological targets involved in its etiology. On these bases, the development of new effective therapeutics becomes crucial and the design of molecules that address more than one specific AD target should represent thus a succeeded strategy for AD treatment. This review will focus on and summarize multifunctional 1 derivatives starting from our last paper published on the same topic in 2010. In the last three years, the design and synthesis of 1 homo- and heterodimers, as well as of 1-hybrid structures for AD therapy, was aimed mainly to discover safer drugs, with decreased hepatotoxicity in comparison to 1, taking also into account the multifactorial pathogenesis of the disease. Most of these new hetero/homo-dimers and/or hybrids of 1, although addressed mainly to acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and Aβ aggregation inhibition, are able to hit additional targets relevant to AD, among which, β-secretase (BACE1), reactive oxygen species (ROS), calcium channels, NMDAR and M1- muscarinic receptors.

The aim of the present study is to establish and validate an assay for secreted amyloid-precursor protein (sAPP)-α and -β in platelets of AD and mild cognitively impaired (MCI) subjects, compared to healthy young and old controls. Freshly isolated platelet extracts (25 µg) were incubated with or without recombinant BACE1 (beta-site APP-Cleaving Enzyme; β-secretase, 8U) at 37°C and low pH and the levels of sAPP-α and sAPP-b were measured by specific ELISAs. Our data show that sAPP-α levels were not different between AD, MCI and control subjects. However, sAPP-β levels in MCI and AD were significantly elevated relative to controls. When recombinant BACE1 was added, no changes were seen in sAPP-α levels, but the processed sAPP-β levels were again markedly increased. The sAPP-β processing was specific and selective after 2.5 hours at 37°C, and was possibly mediated by exogenous BACE1, because it was blocked by a BACE1 inhibitor and BACE1 enzyme levels were enhanced in AD patients.

Recent knockout studies of VDAC1 revealed that homozygote VDAC1 knockout (VDAC1-/-) mice exhibited disrupted learning and synaptic plasticity, and in contrast, VDAC1+/- mice appeared normal in terms of lifespan, fertility, and viability relative to wild-type mice. However, the effects of reduced VDAC1 on mitochondrial/synaptic genes and mitochondrial function in AD-affected neurons are not well understood. In the present study, we characterized mitochondrial/synaptic and AD-related genes and mitochondrial function in VDAC1+/- mice and VDAC1+/+ mice. We found reduced mRNA levels in the AD-related genes, including AβPP, Tau, PS1, PS2, and BACE1; increased levels of the mitochondrial fusion genes Mfn1, Mfn2; reduced levels of the fission genes Drp1 and Fis1; and reduced levels of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore genes VDAC1, ANT, and CypD in VDAC1+/- mice relative to VDAC1+/+ mice. Hexokinase 1 and 2 were significantly upregulated in the VDAC+/- mice. The synaptic genes synaptophysin, synapsin 1 and 2, synaptobrevin 1 and 2, neurogranin, and PSD95 were also upregulated in the VDAC1+/- mice. Free radical production and lipid peroxidation levels were reduced in the VDAC1+/- mice, and cytochrome oxidase activity and ATP levels were elevated, indicating enhanced mitochondrial function in the VDAC1+/- mice. These findings suggest that reduced VDAC1 expression, such as that we found in the VDAC1+/- mice, may be beneficial to synaptic activity, may improve function, and may protect against toxicities of AD-related genes.

BACE (beta-site AβPP cleaving enzyme) 1 inhibition is therefore considered to be a promising disease modifying therapy for Alzheimer's disease. An early assessment of the in vivo activity of BACE inhibitors was done in dogs since AβPP processing is the same as in humans and this species easily enables longitudinal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sampling. Aβ changes in CSF compared to baseline are used to evaluate target engagement of the compounds. Levels of Aβ1-37, Aβ1-38, Aβ1-40, and Aβ1-42 in CSF are measured with immunoassay (Mesoscale electrochemiluminescence technology) and with an ultra high-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). Two experimental BACE inhibitors were evaluated. With the immunoassay, a dose dependent decrease is observed for all four Aβ peptides. Measurements with the UPLC-MS/MS are in line with the immunoassay for Aβ1-37, Aβ1-38, and Aβ1-40, however, for Aβ1-42, differences are sometimes observed when comparing to changes seen in the other peptides with UPLC-MS/MS and with immunoassay results. Generally lower concentrations are measured with immunoassay. The reason for these differences is still unknown. Aβ1-42 is more prone to form aggregates compared to the other peptides. One hypothesis could be that while the immunoassay only measures free Aβ, bound and aggregated Aβ peptides are at least partially dissolved with the UPLC-MS/MS method, since acetonitrile is added to the CSF samples. This increases variability in the concentration of Aβ peptide measured with UPLC-MS/MS, especially for Aβ1-42, potentially masking the compound effect on Aβ1-42 levels.

Identification of cellular mechanisms that regulate BACE1 production is of high relevance to the search for potential disease-modifying therapies that inhibit BACE1 to reduce Aβ accumulation and AD progression. In the present study, we show that the cholesterol oxidation product 27-hydroxycholesterol (27-OHC) increases BACE1 and Aβ levels in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. This increase in BACE1 involves a crosstalk between the two transcription factors NF-κB and the endoplasmic reticulum stress marker, the growth arrest and DNA damage induced gene-153 (gadd153, also called CHOP). We specifically show that 27-OHC induces a substantial increase in NF-κB binding to the BACE1 promoter and subsequent increase in BACE1 transcription and Aβ production. The NF-κB inhibitor, sc514, significantly attenuated the 27-OHC-induced increase in NF-κB-mediated BACE1 expression and Aβ genesis. We further show that the 27-OHC-induced NF-κB activation and increased NF-κB-mediated BACE1 expression is contingent on the increased activation of gadd153. Silencing gadd153 expression with siRNA alleviated the 27-OHC-induced increase in NF-κB activation, NF-κB binding to the BACE1 promoter, and subsequent increase in BACE1 transcription and Aβ production. We also show that increased levels of BACE1 in the triple transgenic mouse model for AD is preceded by gadd153 and NF-κB activation. In summary, our study demonstrates that gadd153 and NF-κB work in concert to regulate BACE1 expression. Agents that inhibit gadd153 activation and subsequent interaction with NF-κB might be promising targets to reduce BACE1 and Aβ overproduction and may ultimately serve as disease-modifying treatments for AD.

Amyloid-β peptides (Aβ) are considered to play a critical role in the onset and progression of AD. Apigenin (4',5,7-trihydroxyflavone) is a pharmacologically active agent. Even though some evidence suggests that it has potential neuroprotective effects, no preexisting study has reported any therapeutic effects of apigenin in AD models. In the present study, we examined the effects of apigenin on cognitive function in APP/PS1 double transgenic AD mice and explored its mechanism(s) of action. Three-month oral treatment with apigenin rescued learning deficits and relieved memory retention in APP/PS1 mice. Apigenin also showed effects affecting APP processing and preventing Aβ burden due to the down-regulation of BACE1 and β-CTF levels, the relief of Aβ deposition, and the decrease of insoluble Aβ levels. Moreover, apigenin exhibited superoxide anion scavenging effects and improved antioxidative enzyme activity of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. In addition, apigenin restored neurotrophic ERK/CREB/BDNF pathway in the cerebral cortex. In conclusion, apigenin may ameliorate AD-associated learning and memory impairment through relieving Aβ burden, suppressing amyloidogenic process, inhibiting oxidative stress, and restoring ERK/CREB/BDNF pathway. Therefore, apigenin appears to represent an alternative medication for the prevention and/or therapy of AD.

Previously, we showed that saturated free-fatty acid, palmitate, causes AD-like changes in primary cortical neurons mediated by astrocytes. However, the molecular mechanisms by which conditioned medium from astrocytes cultured in palmitate induce AD-like changes in neurons are unknown. This study demonstrates that this condition medium from astrocytes elevates calcium level in the neurons, which subsequently increases calpain activity, a calcium-dependent protease, leading to enhance p25/Cdk5 activity and phosphorylation and activation of the STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription) transcription factor. Inhibiting calpain or Cdk5 significantly reduces the upregulation in nuclear level of pSTAT3, which we found to transcriptionally regulate both BACE1 and presenilin-1, the latter is a catalytic subunit of γ-secretase. Decreasing pSTAT3 levels reduced the mRNA levels of both BACE1 and presenilin-1 to near control levels. These data demonstrate a signal pathway leading to the activation of STAT3, and the generation of the amyloid peptide.

Because amyloid precursor protein is predominantly expressed by neurons and deposition of Aβ aggregates in the human brain is highly correlated with the Aβ released at axonal terminals, we focused our investigation of BACE1 localization on the neuritic region. We show that BACE1 was not only enriched in the late Golgi, trans-Golgi network, and early endosomes but also in both axons and dendrites. BACE1 was colocalized with the presynaptic vesicle marker synaptophysin, indicating the presence of BACE1 in synapses. Because the excessive release of Aβ from synapses is attributable to an increase in amyloid deposition, we further explored whether the presence of BACE1 in synapses was regulated by reticulon 3 (RTN3), a protein identified previously as a negative regulator of BACE1. We found that RTN3 is not only localized in the endoplasmic reticulum but also in neuritic regions where no endoplasmic reticulum-shaping proteins are detected, implicating additional functions of RTN3 in neurons. Coexpression of RTN3 with BACE1 in cultured neurons was sufficient to reduce colocalization of BACE1 with synaptophysin. This reduction correlated with decreased anterograde transport of BACE1 in axons in response to overexpressed RTN3. Our results in this study suggest that altered RTN3 levels can impact the axonal transport of BACE1 and demonstrate that reducing axonal transport of BACE1 in axons is a viable strategy for decreasing BACE1 in axonal terminals and, perhaps, reducing amyloid deposition.

We show here that murine EpCAM (mEpCAM) is subject to regulated intramembrane proteolysis in various cells including embryonic stem cells and teratocarcinomas. As shown with ectopically expressed EpCAM variants, cleavages occur at α-, β-, γ-, and ε-sites to generate soluble ectodomains, soluble Aβ-like-, and intracellular fragments termed mEpEX, mEp-β, and mEpICD, respectively. Proteolytic sites in the extracellular part of mEpCAM were mapped using mass spectrometry and represent cleavages at the α- and β-sites by metalloproteases and the b-secretase BACE1, respectively. Resulting C-terminal fragments (CTF) are further processed to soluble Aβ-like fragments mEp-β and cytoplasmic mEpICD variants by the g-secretase complex. Noteworthy, cytoplasmic mEpICD fragments were subject to efficient degradation in a proteasome-dependent manner. In addition the γ-secretase complex dependent cleavage of EpCAM CTF liberates different EpICDs with different stabilities towards proteasomal degradation. Generation of CTF and EpICD fragments and the degradation of hEpICD via the proteasome were similarly demonstrated for the human EpCAM ortholog. Additional EpCAM orthologs have been unequivocally identified in silico in 52 species. Sequence comparisons across species disclosed highest homology of BACE1 cleavage sites and in presenilin-dependent γ-cleavage sites, whereas strongest heterogeneity was observed in metalloprotease cleavage sites.

24081378,"Can BACE1 inhibition mitigate early axonal pathology in neurological diseases?","β-Secretase-1 (BACE1) is the rate-limiting enzyme for the genesis of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides, the main constituents of the amyloid plaques in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. BACE1 is being evaluated as an anti-Aβ target for AD therapy. Recent studies indicate that BACE1 elevation is associated with axonal and presynaptic pathology during plaque development. Evidence also points to a biological role for BACE1 in axonal outgrowth and synapse formation during development. Axonal, including presynaptic, pathology exists in AD as well as many other neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease, epilepsy, stroke, and trauma. In this review, we discuss pharmaceutical BACE1 inhibition as a therapeutic option for axonal pathogenesis, in addition to amyloid pathology. We first introduce the amyloidogenic processing of amyloid-β protein precursor and describe the normal expression pattern of the amyloidogenic proteins in the brain, with an emphasis on BACE1. We then address BACE1 elevation relative to amyloid plaque development, followed by updating recent understanding of a neurotrophic role of BACE1 in axon and synapse development. We further elaborate the occurrence of axonal pathology in some other neurological conditions. Finally, we propose pharmacological inhibition of excessive BACE1 activity as an option to mitigate early axonal pathology occurring in AD and other neurological disorders.

There is great interest in determining the molecular mechanisms underlying interactions between stress, aging, memory and Alzheimer's disease (AD). We have used the chronic mild stress (CMS) model to study the effects of chronic stress on the aging process and the development of central insulin resistance and AD pathology. CMS aged mice showed cognitive impairments in the novel object recognition test. In addition, CMS aged mice displayed both peripheral insulin resistance, as shown by HOMA index, and decreased hippocampal levels of pIRS and downstream intracellular signaling (pAKT, pGSK and pERK1/2). Interestingly, there was a significant increase in both C99:C83 ratio and BACE1 levels in the hippocampus of CMS aged mice. Increased expression of the AD marker pTau was also found in stressed aged mice. Increased expression of the stress-activated protein kinase JNK was found in CMS aged mice, accompanied by significant decreases in glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression and increases in mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) expression. It is suggested that the interaction of stress with aging should be considered when studying determinants of the onset and progression of AD.

Regulation of APP processing is a major focus of research into AD pathogenesis. The trafficking systems of APP and its cleavage enzymes are complex. Transporting APP and secretases into the same subcellular organelles facilitates their interaction and favors APP processing.

Here, we investigated the effect of the most nutritional prevalent phytosterols and cholesterol on APP processing. In general, phytosterols are less amyloidogenic than cholesterol. However, only one phytosterol, stigmasterol, reduced Aβ generation by (1) directly decreasing β-secretase activity, (2) reducing expression of all γ-secretase components, (3) reducing cholesterol and presenilin distribution in lipid rafts implicated in amyloidogenic APP cleavage, and by (4) decreasing BACE1 internalization to endosomal compartments, involved in APP β-secretase cleavage.

However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we crossed knockout mice for an eIF2α kinase (GCN2: general control nonderepressible-2 kinase) with 5XFAD transgenic mice, and investigated whether GCN2 deletion affects AD-like traits in this model. As observed in AD brains, 5XFAD mice recapitulated significant elevations in the β-secretase enzyme BACE1 and the CREB repressor ATF4 concomitant with a dramatic increase of eIF2α phosphorylation. Contrary to expectation, we found that GCN2(-/-) and GCN2(+/-) deficiencies aggravate rather than suppress hippocampal BACE1 and ATF4 elevations in 5XFAD mice, failing to rescue memory deficits as tested by the contextual fear conditioning. The facilitation of these deleterious events resulted in exacerbated β-amyloid accumulation, plaque pathology and CREB dysfunction in 5XFAD mice with GCN2 mutations. Notably, GCN2 deletion caused overactivation of the PKR-endoplasmic reticulum-related kinase (PERK)-dependent eIF2α phosphorylation pathway in 5XFAD mice in the absence of changes in the PKR pathway. Moreover, PERK activation in response to GCN2 deficiency was specific to 5XFAD mice, since phosphorylated PERK levels were equivalent between GCN2(-/-) and wild-type control mice. Our findings suggest that GCN2 may be an important eIF2α kinase under the physiological condition, whereas blocking the GCN2 pathway under exposure to significant β-amyloidosis rather aggravates eIF2α phosphorylation leading to BACE1 and ATF4 elevations in AD.

The results showed that PNS increased α-secretase activity perhaps by enhancing the level of ADAM9 expression, which itself was achieved by upregulating the expression of the ADAM9 gene. In addition, PNS significantly decreased BACE1 protein level by downregulating the level of BACE1 gene expression and consequently precluded the activity of β secretase. However, PNS treatment did not modify γ-secretase activity. Together, our study shows that PNS modulates the levels of protein and gene expressions involved with α and β secretase, thereby increasing α-secretase activity and reducing β-secretase activity, which may be one of the mechanisms of PNS precluding Aβ generation.

Recent evidence has indicated that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) agonists thiazolidinediones (TZDs) can decrease β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) deposition, which is the core component of senile plaques in AD, but the underlying mechanisms still remain unclear. In this study, we investigated whether glimepiride with PPARγ-stimulating activity, an oral anti-diabetic drug, has similar effects on Aβ production in primary cortical neurons. We demonstrated that glimepiride decreased extracellular Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels. The effect of glimepiride on reduction of Aβ40 generation was mediated by downregulation of β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) mRNA and protein expression, and by suppression of BACE1 activity. In addition, we found that high glucose condition enhanced Aβ40 production and glimepiride significantly decreased high glucose-induced Aβ40 production. Finally, a specific PPARγ antagonist GW9662 reversed glimepiride inhibitory effect on Aβ40 generation, suggesting a PPARγ-dependent mechanism may be involved.

In this study, we aimed to investigate the mechanisms of FLZ's neuroprotective effect in APP/PS1 double transgenic mice and SH-SY5Y (APPwt/swe) cells.

The sequential cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the β- and γ-secretases generates Aβ peptides; however, the alternate cleavage of APP by the α- and γ-secretases decreases Aβ production. We previously reported that carnosic acid (CA), a phenolic diterpene compound found in the labiate herbs rosemary and sage, suppresses Aβ (1-40 and 1-42) production by activating α-secretase in cultured SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells (Neurosci.

The treatment of cells with CA suppressed Aβ40/42/43 release (55-71% decrease at 50μM). CA treatment enhanced the mRNA expressions of an α-secretase TACE (tumor necrosis factor-α-converting enzyme, also called a disintegrin and metalloproteinase-17, ADAM17); however, the β-secretase BACE1 (β-site APP-cleaving enzyme-1) was not increased by CA. Knockdown of TACE by siRNA reduced soluble-APPα release enhanced by CA and partially recovered the CA-suppressed Aβ40/42/43 release.

Genetic, cell biological, and biochemical studies suggest that reducing amyloid-β (Aβ) production may serve as a rational therapeutic avenue to delay or prevent AD progression. Inhibition of RhoA, a Rho GTPase family member, is proposed to curb Aβ production. However, a barrier to this hypothesis has been the limited understanding of how the principal downstream effectors of RhoA, Rho-associated, coiled-coil containing protein kinase (ROCK) 1 and ROCK2, modulate Aβ generation. Here, we report that ROCK1 knockdown increased endogenous human Aβ production, whereas ROCK2 knockdown decreased Aβ levels. Inhibition of ROCK2 kinase activity, using an isoform-selective small molecule (SR3677), suppressed β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) enzymatic action and diminished production of Aβ in AD mouse brain. Immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy analyses revealed that SR3677 alters BACE1 endocytic distribution and promotes amyloid precursor protein (APP) traffic to lysosomes. Moreover, SR3677 blocked ROCK2 phosphorylation of APP at threonine 654 (T654); in neurons, T654 was critical for APP processing to Aβ. These observations suggest that ROCK2 inhibition reduces Aβ levels through independent mechanisms. Finally, ROCK2 protein levels were increased in asymptomatic AD, mild cognitive impairment, and AD brains, demonstrating that ROCK2 levels change in the earliest stages of AD and remain elevated throughout disease progression. Collectively, these findings highlight ROCK2 as a mechanism-based therapeutic target to combat Aβ production in AD.

The present study aimed to determine the protective effects of Cerebrolysin on Aβ deposits and secondary neuronal damage in thalamus after cerebral infarction. At 24h after distal middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), Cerebrolysin (5 ml/kg) or saline as control was once daily administered for consecutive 13 days by intraperitoneal injection. Sensory function and secondary thalamic damage were assessed with adhesive-removal test, Nissl staining and immunofluorescence at 14 days after MCAO. Aβ deposits, activity of β-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), apoptosis and autophagy were determined by TUNEL staining, immunofluorescence and immunoblot. The results showed that Cerebrolysin significantly improved sensory deficit compared to controls (p<0.05). Aβ deposits and BACE1 were obviously reduced by Cerebrolysin, which was accompanied by decreases in neuronal loss and astroglial activation compared to controls (all p < 0.05). Coincidently, Cerebrolysin markedly inhibited cleaved caspase-3, conversion of LC3-II, downregulation of Bcl-2 and upregulation of Bax in the ipsilateral thalamus compared to controls (all p<0.05). These findings suggest that Cerebrolysin reduces Aβ deposits, apoptosis and autophagy in the ipsilateral thalamus, which may be associated with amelioration of secondary thalamic damage and functional recovery after cerebral infarction.","1878-5883","Journal of the neurological sciences","(337) 104-11",2014,"Shihui","Xing","S","Department of Neurology and Stroke Center, The First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-Sen University, No. 58 Zhongshan Road 2, Guangzhou 510080, China."

BACE1 activity and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α levels were measured by enzymatic assay and ELISA in the temporal cortex from 18 patients with clinically well-characterized AD, 18 patients with MCI, and 18 healthy controls. We found a significant increase in BACE1 activity and protein level in brains of MCI and AD patients. Moreover, increased BACE1 activity correlated with plaque numbers and cognition status. We also found an increase in TNF-α in MCI brains. In vitro study revealed that TNF-α rather than other cytokines can up-regulate BACE1 protein expression. These findings suggest that BACE1 increase occurs early in MCI and is possibly induced by TNF-α and that BACE1 enzymatic activity may be important for conversion of MCI to AD.

The short Aβ peptide is derived from the large transmembrane Aβ precursor protein (APP). The rate-limiting step in the production of Aβ from APP is mediated by the β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1). Dysregulation of BACE1 levels leading to excess Aβ deposition is implicated in sporadic AD. Thus, elucidating the full complement of regulatory pathways that control BACE1 expression is key to identifying novel drug targets central to the Aβ-generating process. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are expected to participate in this molecular network. Here, we identified a known miRNA, miR-339-5p, as a key contributor to this regulatory network. Two distinct miR-339-5p target sites were predicted in the BACE1 3'-UTR by in silico analyses. Co-transfection of miR-339-5p with a BACE1 3'-UTR reporter construct resulted in significant reduction in reporter expression. Mutation of both target sites eliminated this effect. Delivery of the miR-339-5p mimic also significantly inhibited expression of BACE1 protein in human glioblastoma cells and human primary brain cultures. Delivery of target protectors designed against the miR-339-5p BACE1 3'-UTR target sites in primary human brain cultures significantly elevated BACE1 expression. Finally, miR-339-5p levels were found to be significantly reduced in brain specimens isolated from AD patients as compared with age-matched controls. Therefore, miR-339-5p regulates BACE1 expression in human brain cells and is most likely dysregulated in at least a subset of AD patients making this miRNA a novel drug target.

24357508,"Endothelial nitric oxide: protector of a healthy mind.","Endothelial nitric oxide (NO) is generated by constitutively active endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), an essential enzyme responsible for cardiovascular homeostasis. Historically, endothelial NO was first recognized as a major vasodilator involved in control of vasomotor function and local blood flow. In this review, our attention is focused on the emerging role of endothelial NO in linking cerebrovascular function with cognition. We will discuss the recognized ability of endothelial NO to modulate processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP), influence functional status of microglia, and affect cognitive function. Existing evidence suggests that the loss of NO in cultured human cerebrovascular endothelium causes increased expression of APP and β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) thereby resulting in increased secretion of amyloid β peptides (Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42). Furthermore, increased expression of APP and BACE1 as well as increased production of Aβ peptides was detected in the cerebral microvasculature and brain tissue of eNOS-deficient mice. Since Aβ peptides are considered major cytotoxic molecules responsible for the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, these observations support the concept that a loss of endothelial NO might significantly contribute to the initiation and progression of cognitive decline. In addition, genetic inactivation of eNOS causes activation of microglia and promotes a pro-inflammatory phenotype in the brain. Behavioural analysis revealed that eNOS-deficient mice exhibit impaired cognitive performance thereby indicating that selective loss of endothelial NO has a detrimental effect on the function of neuronal cells. Together with findings from prior studies demonstrating the ability of endothelial NO to affect synaptic plasticity, mitochondrial biogenesis, and function of neuronal progenitor cells, it is becoming apparent that the role of endothelial NO in the control of central nervous system function is very complex. We propose that endothelial NO represents the key molecule linking cerebrovascular and neuronal function.

BACE1 enzymes, however, extend through basal chordates and as far as cnidaria. We then sought to determine whether BACE1 from a species that never evolved Aβ could proteolyze APP substrates that include Aβ.

We demonstrate that Rheb GTPase (Ras homolog enriched in brain), which induces mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) activity, is a physiological regulator of BACE1 stability and activity. Rheb overexpression depletes BACE1 protein levels and reduces Aβ generation, whereas the RNAi knockdown of endogenous Rheb promotes BACE1 accumulation, and this effect by Rheb is independent of its mTOR signaling. Moreover, GTP-bound Rheb interacts with BACE1 and degrades it through proteasomal and lysosomal pathways. Finally, we demonstrate that Rheb levels are down-regulated in the AD brain, which is consistent with an increased BACE1 expression. Altogether, our study defines Rheb as a novel physiological regulator of BACE1 levels and Aβ generation, and the Rheb-BACE1 circuitry may have a role in brain biology and disease.

We report that transport vesicles containing internalized BACE1 in dendrites undergo exclusive retrograde transport toward the soma, whereas they undergo bidirectional transport in axons. Unidirectional dendritic transport requires Eps15-homology-domain-containing (EHD) 1 and 3 protein function. Furthermore, loss of EHD function compromises dynamic axonal transport and overall BACE1 levels in axons. EHD1/3 colocalize with BACE1 and APP β-C-terminal fragments in hippocampal mossy fiber terminals, and their depletion in neurons significantly attenuates Aβ levels.

Here, using snapin-deficient mice combined with gene rescue experiments, we reveal that Snapin, as a dynein motor adaptor for late endosomes, mediates BACE1 retrograde transport. hAPP mutant live neurons and mouse brains exhibited BACE1 accumulation within the altered late endocytic organelles and defective lysosomal targeting due to reduced Snapin-dynein coupling. Deleting snapin or disrupting Snapin-dynein coupling reduces BACE1 transport to lysosomes for degradation, thus enhancing APP processing. Overexpressing Snapin in hAPP neurons reduces β site cleavage of APP by enhancing BACE1 turnover.

Amyloidogenic cleavage of APP by β-secretase/BACE1 generates the C-terminal fragment C99/CTFβ that can be subsequently cleaved by γ-secretase to produce Aβ. Growing evidence indicates that high levels of C99/CTFβ are determinant for AD. Although it has been postulated that γ-secretase-independent pathways must control C99/CTFβ levels, the contribution of organelles with degradative functions, such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or lysosomes, is unclear. In this report, we investigated the turnover and amyloidogenic processing of C99/CTFβ in human H4 neuroglioma cells, and found that C99/CTFβ is localized at the Golgi apparatus in contrast to APP, which is mostly found in endosomes. Conditions that localized C99/CTFβ to the ER resulted in its degradation in a proteasome-dependent manner that first required polyubiquitination, consistent with an active role of the ER associated degradation (ERAD) in this process. Furthermore, when proteasomal activity was inhibited C99/CTFβ was degraded in a chloroquine (CQ)-sensitive compartment, implicating lysosomes as alternative sites for its degradation.

24381583,"A tale of two drug targets: the evolutionary history of BACE1 and BACE2.","The beta amyloid (APP) cleaving enzyme (BACE1) has been a drug target for Alzheimer's Disease (AD) since 1999 with lead inhibitors now entering clinical trials. In 2011, the paralog, BACE2, became a new target for type II diabetes (T2DM) having been identified as a TMEM27 secretase regulating pancreatic β cell function. However, the normal roles of both enzymes are unclear. This study outlines their evolutionary history and new opportunities for functional genomics. We identified 30 homologs (UrBACEs) in basal phyla including Placozoans, Cnidarians, Choanoflagellates, Porifera, Echinoderms, Annelids, Mollusks and Ascidians (but not Ecdysozoans). UrBACEs are predominantly single copy, show 35-45% protein sequence identity with mammalian BACE1, are ~100 residues longer than cathepsin paralogs with an aspartyl protease domain flanked by a signal peptide and a C-terminal transmembrane domain. While multiple paralogs in Trichoplax and Monosiga pre-date the nervous system, duplication of the UrBACE in fish gave rise to BACE1 and BACE2 in the vertebrate lineage. The latter evolved more rapidly as the former maintained the emergent neuronal role. In mammals, Ka/Ks for BACE2 is higher than BACE1 but low ratios for both suggest purifying selection. The 5' exons show higher Ka/Ks than the catalytic section. Model organism genomes show the absence of certain BACE human substrates when the UrBACE is present. Experiments could thus reveal undiscovered substrates and roles. The human protease double-target status means that evolutionary trajectories and functional shifts associated with different substrates will have implications for the development of clinical candidates for both AD and T2DM. A rational basis for inhibition specificity ratios and assessing target-related side effects will be facilitated by a more complete picture of BACE1 and BACE2 functions informed by their evolutionary context.

Moreover, systemic plasma H2S levels are negatively correlated with its severity.

After intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of an H2S donor (NaHS) into APP/PS1 mice, application of exogenous H2S resulted in improved spatial learning and memory acquisition in APP/PS1 mice. H2S administration also led to significant decrease in extracellular levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42, the expression of BACE1 and PS1, and a significant increase of ADAM17 expression. Similarly, an increase in non-amyloidogenic C83 fragment generation and a decrease in amyloidogenic C99 fragment generation were also observed. Thus, NaHS application resulted in a shift from the plaque-forming beta pathway to the non-plaque forming alpha pathway of APP cleavage in 6 and 12 month APP/PS1 mice.

Furthermore, animals exposed to Pb as infants develop cognitive decline and memory impairments in old age. Studies from our lab demonstrated that tolfenamic acid lowers the levels of the amyloid β precursor protein (APP) and its aggregative cleavage product Aβ by inducing the degradation of the transcription factor specificity protein 1 (Sp1). These changes were accompanied by cognitive improvement in transgenic APP knock-in mice. In this study, we examined the effects of tolfenamic acid on beta site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) which is responsible for Aβ production and tested its ability to reverse Pb-induced upregulation in the amyloidogenic pathway. Mice were administered tolfenamic acid for one month and BACE1 gene expression as well as its enzymatic activity were analyzed in the cerebral cortex. Tolfenamic acid was also tested for its ability to reverse changes in Sp1, APP and Aβ that were upregulated by Pb in vitro. Differentiated SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells were either left unexposed, or sequentially exposed to Pb followed by tolfenamic acid. Our results show that tolfenamic acid reduced BACE1 gene expression and enzyme activity in mice. In neuroblastoma cells, Pb upregulated Sp1, APP and Aβ, while tolfenamic acid lowered their expression. These results along with previous data from our lab provide evidence that tolfenamic acid, a drug that has been used for decades for migraine, represents a candidate which can reduce the pathology of AD and may mitigate the damage of environmental risk factors associated with this disease.

24470444,"Transferrin receptor (TfR) trafficking determines brain uptake of TfR antibody affinity variants.","Antibodies to transferrin receptor (TfR) have potential use for therapeutic entry into the brain. We have shown that bispecific antibodies against TfR and β-secretase (BACE1 [β-amyloid cleaving enzyme-1]) traverse the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and effectively reduce brain amyloid β levels. We found that optimizing anti-TfR affinity improves brain exposure and BACE1 inhibition. Here we probe the cellular basis of this improvement and explore whether TfR antibody affinity alters the intracellular trafficking of TfR. Comparing high- and low-affinity TfR bispecific antibodies in vivo, we found that high-affinity binding to TfR caused a dose-dependent reduction of brain TfR levels. In vitro live imaging and colocalization experiments revealed that high-affinity TfR bispecific antibodies facilitated the trafficking of TfR to lysosomes and thus induced the degradation of TfR, an observation which was further confirmed in vivo. Importantly, high-affinity anti-TfR dosing induced reductions in brain TfR levels, which significantly decreased brain exposure to a second dose of low-affinity anti-TfR bispecific. Thus, high-affinity anti-TfR alters TfR trafficking, which dramatically impacts the capacity for TfR to mediate BBB transcytosis.

24478626,"Pin1, a new player in the fate of HIF-1α degradation: an hypothetical mechanism inside vascular damage as Alzheimer's disease risk factor.","Aetiology of neurodegenerative mechanisms underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) are still under elucidation. The contribution of cerebrovascular deficiencies (such as cerebral ischemia/stroke) has been strongly endorsed in recent years. Reduction of blood supply leading to hypoxic condition is known to activate cellular responses mainly controlled by hypoxia-inducible transcription factor-1 (HIF-1). Thus alterations of oxygen responsive HIF-1α subunit in the central nervous system may contribute to the cognitive decline, especially influencing mechanisms associated to amyloid precursor protein (APP) amyloidogenic metabolism. Although HIF-1α protein level is known to be regulated by von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) ubiquitin-proteasome system, it has been recently suggested that glycogen synthase kinase-3β (Gsk-3β) promotes a VHL-independent HIF-1α degradation. Here we provide evidences that in rat primary hippocampal cell cultures, HIF-1α degradation might be mediated by a synergic action of Gsk-3β and peptidyl-prolyl cis/trans isomerase (Pin1). In post-ischemic conditions, such as those mimicked with oxygen glucose deprivation (OGD), HIF-1α protein level increases remaining unexpectedly high for long time after normal condition restoration jointly with the increase of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and β-secretase 1 (BACE1) protein expression (70 and 140% respectively). Interestingly the Pin1 activity decreases about 40-60% and Pin1(S16) inhibitory phosphorylation significantly increases, indicating that Pin1 binding to its substrate and enzymatic activity are reduced by treatment. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrate that HIF-1α/Pin1 in normoxia are associated, and that in presence of specific Pin1 and Gsk-3β inhibitors their interaction is reduced in parallel to an increase of HIF-1α protein level. Thus we suggest that in post-OGD neurons the high level of HIF-1α might be due to Pin1 binding ability and activity reduction which affects HIF-1α degradation: an event that may highlight the relevance of ischemia/HIF-1α as a risk factor in AD pathogenesis.

Monomeric form of Aβ, indeed, could exert a physiological role. Considering the anti-oligomerization property of all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA), the involvement of monomeric Aβ1-42 in ATRA-induced neuronal differentiation has been investigated. Four-day ATRA treatment increases β-secretase 1 (BACE1) level, Aβ1-42 production, and receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) expression. RAGE is a well-recognized receptor for Aβ, and the block of both RAGE and Aβ1-42 with specific antibodies strongly impairs neurite formation in ATRA-treated cells. The involvement of Aβ1-42 and RAGE in ATRA-induced morphologic changes has been confirmed treating undifferentiated cells with different molecular assemblies of peptide: 1 μM monomeric, but not oligomeric, Aβ1-42 increases RAGE expression and favors neurite elongation. The block of RAGE completely prevents this effect. Furthermore, our data underline the involvement of the RAGE-dependent adhesion molecule amphoterin-induced gene and open reading frame-1 as downstream effector of both ATRA and Aβ1-42.

24512022,"Relationship between amyloid-beta and the ubiquitin-proteasome system in Alzheimer's disease.","Amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptide is the original causative factor of Alzheimer's disease (AD) according to the amyloid cascade hypothesis. The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), the major intracellular protein quality control system in eukaryotic cells, is related to AD pathogenesis. There is growing evidence showing that there is a tight relationship between Abeta and UPS and this relationship plays an important role in AD pathogenesis. This article reviews the relationship between Abeta and the UPS in terms of the following three aspects: the interaction of the two factors, the ubiquitinating process of Abeta, and impact of dysfunctional UPS on Abeta production. The impairment in the UPS in AD could affect the degradation of Abeta and lead to an abnormal accumulation of Abeta. At the same time, Abeta inhibits the proteasomal activity and subsequently leads to impairment of multivesicular bodies (MVB) sorting pathway, forming an interacting relationship between Abeta and UPS. Mutant ubiquitin (Ub) and ubiquitin-like (UBL) ubiquilin-1 are related to Abeta accumulation. Meanwhile E2 conjugating enzymes, E3 ligases, and de-ubiquitinating enzymes, all of which function in the ubiquitination process, play a pivotal role in the proteasomal degradation of Abeta. Ubiquitin-proteasome system has an immense impact on the amyloidogenic pathway of amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing that generates Abeta. Upregulation in proteasomal degradation of BACE1 and components of gamma-secretase leads to decreased Abeta accumulation. A deep look into the mechanism underlying the interplay between Abeta and UPS may provide alternative therapeutic targets and lead to new drugs and therapies.

Its debilitating symptoms are manifested by disturbances in many important brain functions, which are influenced by adenosine. Hence, adenosinergic system is considered as a potential therapeutic target in AD treatment. In the present study, we found that sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS, an H2S donor, 100 µM) attenuated HENECA (a selective A2A receptor agonist, 10-200 nM) induced β-amyloid (1-42) (Aβ42) production in SH-SY5Y cells. NaHS also interfered with HENECA-stimulated production and post-translational modification of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by inhibiting its maturation. Measurement of the C-terminal APP fragments generated from its enzymatic cleavage by β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) showed that NaHS did not have any significant effect on β-secretase activity. However, the direct measurements of HENECA-elevated γ-secretase activity and mRNA expressions of presenilins suggested that the suppression of Aβ42 production in NaHS pretreated cells was mediated by inhibiting γ-secretase. NaHS induced reductions were accompanied by similar decreases in intracellular cAMP levels and phosphorylation of cAMP responsive element binding protein (CREB). NaHS significantly reduced the elevated cAMP and Aβ42 production caused by forskolin (an adenylyl cyclase, AC agonist) alone or forskolin in combination with IBMX (a phosphodiesterase inhibitor), but had no effect on those caused by IBMX alone. Moreover, pretreatment with NaHS significantly attenuated HENECA-elevated AC activity and mRNA expressions of various AC isoforms. These data suggest that NaHS may preferentially suppress AC activity when it was stimulated. In conclusion, H2S attenuated HENECA induced Aβ42 production in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells through inhibiting γ-secretase via a cAMP dependent pathway.

24530026,"Lessons from a BACE1 inhibitor trial: off-site but not off base.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by formation of neuritic plaque primarily composed of a small filamentous protein called amyloid-β peptide (Aβ). The rate-limiting step in the production of Aβ is the processing of Aβ precursor protein (APP) by β-site APP-cleaving enzyme (BACE1). Hence, BACE1 activity plausibly plays a rate-limiting role in the generation of potentially toxic Aβ within brain and the development of AD, thereby making it an interesting drug target. A phase II trial of the promising LY2886721 inhibitor of BACE1 was suspended in June 2013 by Eli Lilly and Co., due to possible liver toxicity. This outcome was apparently a surprise to the study's team, particularly since BACE1 knockout mice and mice treated with the drug did not show such liver toxicity. Lilly proposed that the problem was not due to LY2886721 anti-BACE1 activity. We offer an alternative hypothesis, whereby anti-BACE1 activity may induce apparent hepatotoxicity through inhibiting BACE1's processing of β-galactoside α-2,6-sialyltransferase I (STGal6 I). In knockout mice, paralogues, such as BACE2 or cathepsin D, could partially compensate. Furthermore, the short duration of animal studies and short lifespan of study animals could mask effects that would require several decades to accumulate in humans. Inhibition of hepatic BACE1 activity in middle-aged humans would produce effects not detectable in mice. We present a testable model to explain the off-target effects of LY2886721 and highlight more broadly that so-called off-target drug effects might actually represent off-site effects that are not necessarily off-target. Consideration of this concept in forthcoming drug design, screening, and testing programs may prevent such failures in the future.

Numerous microRNAs regulate amyloid precursor protein (APP) expression and metabolism. We previously reported that miR-101 is a negative regulator of APP expression in cultured hippocampal neurons. In this study, a search for predicted APP metabolism-associated miR-101 targets led to the identification of a conserved miR-101 binding site within the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the mRNA encoding Ran-binding protein 9 (RanBP9). RanBP9 increases APP processing by β-amyloid converting enzyme 1 (BACE1), secretion of soluble APPβ (sAPPβ), and generation of Aβ. MiR-101 significantly reduced reporter gene expression when co-transfected with a RanBP9 3'-UTR reporter construct, while site-directed mutagenesis of the predicted miR-101 target site eliminated the reporter response. To investigate the effect of stable inhibition of miR-101 both in vitro and in vivo, a microRNA sponge was developed to bind miR-101 and derepress its targets. Four tandem bulged miR-101 responsive elements (REs), located downstream of the enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) open reading frame and driven by the synapsin promoter, were placed in a lentiviral vector to create the pLSyn-miR-101 sponge. Delivery of the sponge to primary hippocampal neurons significantly increased both APP and RanBP9 expression, as well as sAPPβ levels in the conditioned medium. Importantly, silencing of endogenous RanBP9 reduced sAPPβ levels in miR-101 sponge-containing hippocampal cultures, indicating that miR-101 inhibition may increase amyloidogenic processing of APP by RanBP9. Lastly, the impact of miR-101 on its targets was demonstrated in vivo by intrahippocampal injection of the pLSyn-miR-101 sponge into C57BL6 mice.

Knockout or overexpression of the CatB gene reduced or increased, respectively, pGlu-Aβ(3-40/42), flAβ(1-40/42), and pGlu-Aβ plaque load, but knockout of the BACE1 gene had no effect on those parameters in the transgenic mice.

Moreover, CatB knockout and E64d treatment has been previously shown to improve memory deficits in the AβPPLon mice.

Three novel metabolites, formed by conversion of pyrimidine to pyrazole, were observed in the (14)C-radiolabeled mass balance study in rats. Their structures were characterized by high-resolution mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance. Although these metabolites accounted for <5% of the administered dose, their unique nature prompted us to conduct further investigations.

Further, their generation was inhibited by 1-aminobenzotriazole, indicating involvement of cytochrome P450s. Studies with rat recombinant enzymes identified that CYP2D2 generated the N-hydroxypyrazole metabolite from GNE-892. This biotransformation proceeded through multiple steps from the likely precursor, pyrimidine N-oxide. On the basis of these data, we propose a mechanism in which the pyrimidine is activated via N-oxidation, followed by a second oxidative process that opens the pyrimidine ring to form a formamide intermediate. After hydrolysis of the formamide, a carbon is lost as formic acid, together with ring closure to form the pyrazole ring.

Varying doses of α-asarone was orally administered (7.5, 15, or 30 mg/kg) once a day for 3 days before the LPS (3 mg/kg) injection. α-Asarone significantly reduced TNF-α and IL-1β mRNA at 4 and 24 hours after the LPS injection at dose of 30 mg/kg. At 24 hours after the LPS injection, the loss of CA1 neurons, the increase of TUNEL-labeled cells, and the up-regulation of BACE1 expression in the hippocampus were attenuated by 30 mg/kg of α-asarone treatment. α-Asarone significantly reduced Iba1 protein expression in the hippocampal tissue at a dose of 30 mg/kg. α-Asarone did not reduce the number of Iba1-expressing microglia on immunohistochemistry but the average cell size and percentage areas of Iba1-expressing microglia in the hippocampus were significantly decreased by 30 mg/kg of α-asarone treatment. In the Morris water maze test, α-asarone significantly prolonged the swimming time spent in the target and peri-target zones. α-Asarone also significantly increased the number of target heading and memory score in the Morris water maze.

24612608,"Flotillins bind to the dileucine sorting motif of β-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 and influence its endosomal sorting.","The β-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is a protease that participates in the amyloidogenic cleavage of the Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein. Trafficking of BACE1 has been shown to be largely mediated by an acidic cluster dileucine motif in its cytoplasmic tail. This sorting signal functions both in endocytosis and endosomal sorting/recycling of BACE1 by providing a binding site for various sorting factors, such as the Golgi-localizing γ-ear containing ADP ribosylation factor binding (GGA) proteins that mediate BACE1 sorting within endosomes. Because flotillin-1 has been suggested to bind to BACE1 cytoplasmic tail, we analyzed the role of flotillins in BACE1 sorting. We show that flotillin-1 directly binds to the dileucine motif in the cytoplasmic tail of BACE1, whereas flotillin-2 binding is mainly mediated by its interaction with flotillin-1. Depletion of flotillins results in altered subcellular localization of BACE1 in endosomes and stabilization of BACE1 protein. Furthermore, amyloidogenic processing of Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein is increased. Flotillins compete with GGA proteins for binding to the dileucine motif in the BACE1 tail, suggesting that they play an important role in endosomal sorting of BACE1. The present study shows for the first time that flotillins are involved in endosomal sorting of BACE1. Because the endosomal localization of BACE1 affects its function as the β-secretase by increasing amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid precursor protein, flotillins may play a novel role in Alzheimer's disease. The present study is the first to show that flotillins bind to a canonical sorting signal and influence the binding of endosomal sorting factors onto cargo tails.","1742-4658","The FEBS journal","(281) 2074-87",2014,"Bincy A","John","BA","Institute of Biochemistry, Medical Faculty, University of Giessen, Germany."

Here, we have isolated and analyzed the lipid composition of lipid rafts from different brain areas from control and AD subjects at initial neuropathologic stages. We have observed that frontal cortex lipid rafts are profoundly altered in AD brains from the earliest stages of AD, namely AD I/II. These changes in the lipid matrix of lipid rafts affected both lipid classes and fatty acids and were also detected in the entorhinal cortex, but not in the cerebellum from the same subjects. Paralleling these changes, lipid rafts from AD frontal and entorhinal cortices displayed higher anisotropy for environment-sensitive probes, indicating that lipid changes in AD lipid rafts increased membrane order and viscosity in these domains. The pathophysiological consequences of these alterations in the development and progression of AD were strengthened by the significant, and specific, accumulation of β-secretase within the lipid rafts of AD subjects even at the earliest stages. Our results provide a mechanistic connection between lipid alterations in these microdomains and amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein.

24637500,"Postsynaptic target specific synaptic dysfunctions in the CA3 area of BACE1 knockout mice.","Beta-amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), a major neuronal β-secretase critical for the formation of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide, is considered one of the key therapeutic targets that can prevent the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although a complete ablation of BACE1 gene prevents Aβ formation, we previously reported that BACE1 knockouts (KOs) display presynaptic deficits, especially at the mossy fiber (MF) to CA3 synapses. Whether the defect is specific to certain inputs or postsynaptic targets in CA3 is unknown. To determine this, we performed whole-cell recording from pyramidal cells (PYR) and the stratum lucidum (SL) interneurons in the CA3, both of which receive excitatory MF terminals with high levels of BACE1 expression. BACE1 KOs displayed an enhancement of paired-pulse facilitation at the MF inputs to CA3 PYRs without changes at the MF inputs to SL interneurons, which suggests postsynaptic target specific regulation. The synaptic dysfunction in CA3 PYRs was not restricted to excitatory synapses, as seen by an increase in the paired-pulse ratio of evoked inhibitory postsynaptic currents from SL to CA3 PYRs. In addition to the changes in evoked synaptic transmission, BACE1 KOs displayed a reduction in the frequency of miniature excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs and mIPSCs) in CA3 PYRs without alteration in mEPSCs recorded from SL interneurons. This suggests that the impairment may be more global across diverse inputs to CA3 PYRs. Our results indicate that the synaptic dysfunctions seen in BACE1 KOs are specific to the postsynaptic target, the CA3 PYRs, independent of the input type.

However, a lower apoptotic rate of nerve cells is detected in the brain compared to that in other organs in neurodegenerative patients or in animal models, suggesting that neuronal apoptosis induced by any type of risk factors is intricately regulated. Human and animal studies demonstrated that a high concentration of oxidized LDL (ox-LDL) in the brain, which is associated with hyperlipidemia, is one of the key apoptosis inducers in neurodegenerative diseases. However, the mechanism underlying the ox-LDL-mediated regulation of neuronal apoptosis has not been fully elucidated. Recently, we investigated proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), a striking gene involved in lipid metabolism that exhibits a positive correlation with macrophage and endothelial cell apoptosis induced by ox-LDL. Moreover, PCSK9 may degrade β-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), the key enzyme cleaving amyloid precursor protein (APP) to generate amyloid β peptide (Aβ). Aβ is another key apoptosis inducer in neurodegenerative diseases. Our findings indicated that PCSK9 may be upregulated by the high levels of ox-LDL in the brain associated with hyperlipidemia and promote neuronal apoptosis through the NF-κB-B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2)/Bax-caspase 9-caspase 3 signaling pathways. Moreover, increased PCSK9 levels may inhibit the APP/Aβ metabolic pathway and reduce Aβ generation by degrading BACE1, thereby decreasing Aβ-induced neuronal apoptosis.

24658363,"Evidence of a novel mechanism for partial γ-secretase inhibition induced paradoxical increase in secreted amyloid β protein.","BACE1 (β-secretase) and α-secretase cleave the Alzheimer's amyloid β protein (Aβ) precursor (APP) to C-terminal fragments of 99 aa (CTFβ) and 83 aa (CTFα), respectively, which are further cleaved by γ-secretase to eventually secrete Aβ and Aα (a.k.a. P3) that terminate predominantly at residues 40 and 42. A number of γ-secretase inhibitors (GSIs), such as N-[N-(3,5-Difluorophenacetyl-L-alanyl)]-S-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT), have been developed with the goal of reducing Aβ to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD). Although most studies show that DAPT inhibits Aβ in a dose-dependent manner several studies have also detected a biphasic effect with an unexpected increase at low doses of DAPT in cell cultures, animal models and clinical trials. In this article, we confirm the increase in Aβ40 and Aβ42 in SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells treated with low doses of DAPT and identify one of the mechanisms for this paradox. We studied the pathway by first demonstrating that stimulation of Aβ, a product of γ-secretase, was accompanied by a parallel increase of its substrate CTFβ, thereby demonstrating that the inhibitor was not anomalously stimulating enzyme activity at low levels. Secondly, we have demonstrated that inhibition of an Aβ degrading activity, endothelin converting enzyme (ECE), yielded more Aβ, but abolished the DAPT-induced stimulation. Finally, we have demonstrated that Aα, which is generated in the secretory pathway before endocytosis, is not subject to the DAPT-mediated stimulation. We therefore conclude that impairment of γ-secretase can paradoxically increase Aβ by transiently skirting Aβ degradation in the endosome. This study adds to the growing body of literature suggesting that preserving γ-secretase activity, rather than inhibiting it, is important for prevention of neurodegeneration.

Oral administration of telmisartan at two nonhypotensive doses (0.7 or 0.35 mg/kg) significantly improved memory deficits in STZ-induced diabetic mice.

A clinical microdosing strategy was being considered for de-risking the potential pharmacokinetic liabilities of GNE-892. We tested whether dose-proportionality was observed in cynomolgus monkey as proof-of-concept for a human microdosing study. With cryopreserved monkey hepatocytes, concentration-dependency for substrate turnover and the relative contribution of P450- versus AO-mediated metabolism were observed. Characterization of the kinetics of these metabolic pathways demonstrated differences in the affinities of P450 and AO for GNE-892, which supported the metabolic profiles that had been obtained. To test if this metabolic shift occurred in vivo, mass balance studies in monkeys were conducted at doses of 0.085 and 15 mg/kg. Plasma exposure of GNE-892 following oral administration was more than 20-fold greater than dose proportional at the high-dose. P-gp-mediated efflux was unable to explain the discrepancy. The profiles of metabolites in circulation and excreta were indicative that oxidative metabolism limited the exposure to unchanged GNE-892 at the low dose. Further, the in vivo data supported the concentration-dependent metabolic shift between P450 and AO. In conclusion, microdosing of GNE-892 was not predictive of pharmacokinetics at a more pharmacologically relevant dose due to saturable absorption and metabolism. Therefore, it is important to consider ADME liabilities and their potential concentration-dependency when deciding upon a clinical microdosing strategy.

Their role in Alzheimer's disease is being studied and explored in order to develop a new therapeutic strategy based on specific gene silencing. This disease is characterized by protein deposits, mainly deposits of extracellular Aβ plaques, produced upon endoproteolytic cleavage of APP by ß-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1). Recent studies have shown that particularly miR-29 cluster can be involved in the decrease of Aβ plaques production, by acting on BACE1 expression silencing. In order to use this microRNA as potential therapeutic it is essential to guarantee its purity, stability and integrity. Hence, the main purpose of this study was the development of a new affinity chromatographic strategy by using an O-phospho-l-tyrosine matrix and applying Box-Behnken design (BBD) to obtain pre-miR-29 with high purity degree and yield, envisioning its application in gene therapy. Thus, after process optimization the best results were achieved with a decreasing ammonium sulfate gradient in 10mM Tris buffer, pH 8 (1.6M (NH4)2SO4, 1.11M (NH4)2SO4 and 0M (NH4)2SO4), at 16°C. These experimental conditions allowed the recovery of pre-miR-29 with 52% of purity and 71% of recovery yield. The O-phospho-l-tyrosine matrix was initially chosen to mimic the natural interactions that occur inside the cell, and in fact it was proved a satisfactory selectivity for pre-miR-29. Also the innovative application of BBD for this strategy was efficient (R(2)=0.98 for % relative recovery and R(2)=0.93 for % relative purity) and essential to achieve best purification results in short time, saving lab resources.

In recent years SUMO protein modification has emerged as a possible cellular mechanism involved in AD. Some of the proteins engaged in the physiopathological process of AD, like BACE1, GSK3-β tau, AβPP, and JNK, are in fact subject to protein SUMO modifications or interactions. Here, we have investigated the SUMO/deSUMOylation balance and SUMO-related proteins during the onset and progression of the pathology in the Tg2576 mouse model of AD.

Interestingly this is paralleled by increased expression levels of Ubc9 and SENP1 in both brain regions. At 6 months of age also the SUMO-1 mRNA resulted augmented. SUMO-2-ylation was surprisingly decreased in old transgenic mice and was unaltered in the other time windows. The fact that alterations in SUMO/deSUMOylation equilibrium occur from the early phases of AD suggests that global posttranslational modifications may play an important role in the mechanisms underlying disease pathogenesis, thus providing potential targets for pharmacological interventions.

One example is the olfactory sensory map of topographic axonal connectivity. While intrinsic odorant receptor signaling in olfactory sensory neurons (OSN) determines anterior-posterior counter gradients of the axonal guidance receptors Neuropilin-1 and Plexin-A1, little is known about stimulus-dependent gradients of protein expression, which correlates with the functional organization of the olfactory sensory map along its dorsomedial (DM)-ventrolateral (VL) axis. Deficiency of the Alzheimer's β-secretase BACE1, which is expressed in a DM(low)-VL(high) gradient, results in OSN axon targeting errors in a DM > VL and gene dose-dependent manner. We show that expression of BACE1 and the all-trans retinoic acid (RA)-degrading enzyme Cyp26B1 form DM-VL counter gradients in the olfactory epithelium. Analyses of mRNA and protein levels in OSNs after naris occlusion, in mice deficient in the olfactory cyclic nucleotide-gated channel and in relation to onset of respiration, show that BACE1 and Cyp26B1 expression in OSNs inversely depend on neuronal activity. Overexpression of a Cyp26B1 or presence of a dominant negative RA receptor transgene selectively in OSNs, inhibit BACE1 expression while leaving the DM(low)-VL(high) gradient of the axonal guidance protein Neuropilin-2 intact. We conclude that stimulus-dependent neuronal activity can control the expression of the RA catabolic enzyme Cyp26B1 and downstream genes such as BACE1. This result is pertinent to an understanding of the mechanisms by which a topographic pattern of connectivity is achieved and modified as a consequence of graded gene expression and sensory experience.

However, the mechanisms of TNFRII in AD pathogenesis remain unclear. In the present study, by using the gene-targeting approach to delete TNFRII in AD transgenic mouse model, we found that, in the brain of APP23 mice with TNFRII deletion (APP23/TNFRII(-/-)), AD-like pathology, i.e. plaque formation and microglial activation, occurs as early as 6 months of age. To test whether the increased levels of Aβ plaques was due to elevated Aβ, we measured Aβ and found that Aβ levels indeed were significantly increased at this age. Because β-secretase, BACE1, is critical enzyme for Aβ production, we have examined BACE1 and found that BACE1 is increased in both protein levels and enzymatic activity as early as 6 months of age; Having shown that BACE1 promoter region contains NF-κB binding sites, we found that cytoplasmic NF-κB was elevated and SUMO1 binding to IκBα was decreased. To further verify these findings, we have overexpressed TNFRII and identified that overexpressing TNFRII can reverse the findings from APP23/TNFRII(-/-) mice. Altogether, our results demonstrate novel roles of TNFRII in the regulation of Aβ production, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy for AD by up-regulating TNFRII levels and elevating phosphorylated IκBα by SUMOylation.

24844149,"Nuclear 82-kDa choline acetyltransferase decreases amyloidogenic APP metabolism in neurons from APP/PS1 transgenic mice.","Alzheimer disease (AD) is associated with increased amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) to β-amyloid peptides (Aβ), cholinergic neuron loss with decreased choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) activity, and cognitive dysfunction. Both 69-kDa ChAT and 82-kDa ChAT are expressed in cholinergic neurons in human brain and spinal cord with 82-kDa ChAT localized predominantly to neuronal nuclei, suggesting potential alternative functional roles for the enzyme. By gene microarray analysis, we found that 82-kDa ChAT-expressing IMR32 neural cells have altered expression of genes involved in diverse cellular functions. Importantly, genes for several proteins that regulate APP processing along amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic pathways are differentially expressed in 82-kDa ChAT-containing cells. The predicted net effect based on observed changes in expression patterns of these genes would be decreased amyloidogenic APP processing with decreased Aβ production. This functional outcome was verified experimentally as a significant decrease in BACE1 protein levels and activity and a concomitant reduction in the release of endogenous Aβ1-42 from neurons cultured from brains of AD-model APP/PS1 transgenic mice. The expression of 82-kDa ChAT in neurons increased levels of GGA3, which is involved in trafficking BACE1 to lysosomes for degradation. shRNA-induced decreases in GGA3 protein levels attenuated the 82-kDa ChAT-mediated decreases in BACE1 protein and activity and Aβ1-42 release. Evidence that 82-kDa ChAT can enhance GGA3 gene expression is shown by enhanced GGA3 gene promoter activity in SN56 neural cells expressing this ChAT protein. These studies indicate a novel relationship between cholinergic neurons and APP processing, with 82-kDa ChAT acting as a negative regulator of Aβ production. This decreased formation of Aβ could result in protection for cholinergic neurons, as well as protection of other cells in the vicinity that are sensitive to increased levels of Aβ. Decreasing levels of 82-kDa ChAT due to increasing age or neurodegeneration could alter the balance towards increasing Aβ production, with this potentiating the decline in function of cholinergic neurons.

No differences in RTN3 or PPIL2 mRNA levels were found in individuals with AD, compared to controls. Both RTN3 and PPIL2 mRNA levels correlated significantly with BACE1 mRNA and all three showed similar disease stage-dependent changes with respect to NSE and GFAP. These findings indicated that the in vitro data demonstrating an effect of PPIL2 on BACE1 expression have functional relevance in vivo.

Previously, we have shown that the AD-like phenotype in NPC model cells involves cholesterol-dependent enhanced APP cleavage by β-secretase and accumulation of both APP and BACE1 within endocytic compartments. Since retrograde transport of BACE1 from endocytic compartments to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) is regulated by the Golgi-localized γ-ear containing ADP ribosylation factor-binding protein 1 (GGA1), we analyzed in this work a potential role of GGA1 in the AD-like phenotype of NPC1-null cells. Overexpression of GGA1 caused a shift in APP processing towards the non-amyloidogenic pathway by increasing the localization of APP at the cell surface. However, the observed effect appear to be independent on the subcellular localization and phosphorylation state of BACE1. These findings show that the AD-like phenotype of NPC model cells can be partly reverted by promoting a non-amyloidogenic processing of APP through the upregulation of GGA1 supporting its preventive role against AD.

The adipocytokine leptin has been demonstrated to reduce Aβ production and decrease BACE1 activity and expression levels. However, the signaling cascades involved in the leptin-induced mitigation in Aβ levels and BACE1 expression levels have not been elucidated. We have demonstrated that the transcription factor nuclear factor - kappa B (NF-κB) positively regulates BACE1 transcription. NF-κB activity is tightly regulated by the mammalian sirtuin SIRT1. Multiple studies have cogently evinced that leptin activates the metabolic master regulator SIRT1. In this study, we determined the extent to which SIRT1 expression and activity regulate the leptin-induced attenuation in BACE1 expression and Aβ levels in cultured human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. This study also elucidated and delineated the signal transduction pathways involved in the leptin induced mitigation in BACE1 expression. Our results demonstrate for the first time that leptin attenuates the activation and transcriptional activity of NF-κB by reducing the acetylation of the p65 subunit in a SIRT1-dependent manner. Furthermore, our data shows that leptin reduces the NF-κB-mediated transcription of BACE1 and consequently reduces Amyloid-β genesis. Our study provides a valuable insight and a novel mechanism by which leptin reduces BACE1 expression and Amyloid-β production and may help design potential therapeutic interventions.

Mutations in the A β precursor protein (APP) and a protease involved in A β production from APP strongly argue for a pathogenic role of A β in AD, while mutations in tau are associated with related disorders collectively called frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD). Despite intense effort, therapeutic strategies that target A β or tau have not yet yielded medications, suggesting that alternative approaches should be pursued. In recent years, our laboratory has studied the role of mRNA in AD and FTLD, specifically those encoding tau and the A β -producing protease BACE1. As many FTLD-causing tau mutations destabilize a hairpin structure that regulates RNA splicing, we have targeted this structure with small molecules, antisense oligonucleotides, and small molecule-antisense conjugates. We have also discovered that microRNA interaction with the 3'-untranslated region of tau regulates tau expression. Regarding BACE1, we found that alternative splicing leads to inactive splice isoforms and antisense oligonucleotides shift splicing toward these inactive isoforms to decrease A β production. In addition, a G-quadruplex structure in the BACE1 mRNA plays a role in splice regulation. The prospects for targeting tau and BACE1 mRNAs as therapeutic strategies will be discussed.

However, elevated phospho-eIF2α also paradoxically causes translational activation of a subset of messenger RNAs such as the β-secretase enzyme, β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) repressor, activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4). Therefore, we tested whether genetic reduction of the eIF2α kinase PERK may prevent these deleterious events and mitigate Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like neuropathology and cognitive impairments in the 5XFAD mouse model. PERK haploinsufficiency blocked overactivation of the PERK-eIF2α pathway, as evidenced by significant reductions in phosphorylation of PERK and eIF2α, in 5XFAD mice. PERK haploinsufficiency was sufficient to rescue memory deficits and cholinergic neurodegeneration in this AD model. Notably, PERK haploinsufficiency also prevented BACE1 elevations, resulting in reduced levels of amyloid-β peptides and plaque burden in 5XFAD mice. Moreover, CREB dysfunction was restored in PERK(+/-)·5XFAD mice concomitant with reversal of ATF4 upregulation. Together, these findings suggest that PERK may be a disease-modifying therapeutic target to prevent multiple memory-disrupting mechanisms associated with AD.

We found that the overexpression of BACE1 or SET significantly inhibited cell proliferation. Moreover, knockdown of SET in BACE1 overexpression cells significantly rescued BACE1-induced cell growth suppression. Furthermore, both BACE1 and SET protein levels were increased in Down syndrome patients. It suggests that BACE1 overexpression-induced SET upregulation may contribute to growth delay and cognitive impairment in DS patients.

Similarly, physiological functions for β- and γ-secretases, the two key enzymes that produce Aβ by sequentially processing the amyloid precursor protein (APP), have been discovered over recent years. In particular, activity-dependent production of Aβ has been suggested to play a role in homeostatic regulation of excitatory synaptic function. There is accumulating evidence that activity-dependent immediate early gene Arc is an activity ""sensor,"" which acts upstream of Aβ production and triggers AMPA receptor endocytosis to homeostatically downregulate the strength of excitatory synaptic transmission. We previously reported that Arc is critical for sensory experience-dependent homeostatic reduction of excitatory synaptic transmission in the superficial layers of visual cortex.

Chronic administration of D-galactose (150 mg/kg·d, s.c.) for 7 weeks significantly impaired cognitive performance (both in step-through passive and active avoidance tests) and locomotor activity (in open-field test) and the ability of spatial learning and memory (in Morris water maze test) compared with the control group. The results revealed that polyprenols treatment for 2 weeks significantly ameliorated model mice's cognitive performance and oxidative defense. All groups of polyprenols enhanced the learning and memory ability in step-through passive and active avoidance tests, locomotor activity in open-field test, and the ability of spatial learning and memory in Morris water maze test. Furthermore, high and middle level of polyprenols significantly increased total antioxidative capacity (T-AOC), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), super oxide dismutase (SOD) activity, neprilysin (NEP), and β-site AβPP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) expression, while nitric oxide (NO), nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity, malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration, and the level of Aβ1-42 and presenilin 1 (PS1) were decreased.

In summary, we have demonstrated that polyprenols may ameliorate memory and cognitive impairment via enhancing oxidative defense and affecting generation and dissimilation of Aβ-related enzymes, suggesting that polyprenols represent a novel drug for treating Alzheimer's disease.","1574-4647","Age (Dordrecht, Netherlands)","(36) 9676",2014,"Cong","Wang","C","Department of Pharmacology, China Pharmaceutical University, No. 24 Tong Jia Xiang, Nanjing, 210009,, JiangSu Province, China."
24985735,"Multifunctional, self-assembling anionic peptide-lipid nanocomplexes for targeted siRNA delivery.","Formulations of cationic liposomes and polymers readily self-assemble by electrostatic interactions with siRNA to form cationic nanoparticles which achieve efficient transfection and silencing in vitro. However, the utility of cationic formulations in vivo is limited due to rapid clearance from the circulation, due to their association with serum proteins, as well as systemic and cellular toxicity. These problems may be overcome with anionic formulations but they provide challenges of self-assembly and transfection efficiency. We have developed anionic, siRNA nanocomplexes utilizing anionic PEGylated liposomes and cationic targeting peptides that overcome these problems. Biophysical measurements indicated that at optimal ratios of components, anionic PEGylated nanocomplexes formed spherical particles and that, unlike cationic nanocomplexes, were resistant to aggregation in the presence of serum, and achieved significant gene silencing although their non-PEGylated anionic counterparts were less efficient. We have evaluated the utility of anionic nanoparticles for the treatment of neuronal diseases by administration to rat brains of siRNA to BACE1, a key enzyme involved in the formation of amyloid plaques. Silencing of BACE1 was achieved in vivo following a single injection of anionic nanoparticles by convection enhanced delivery and specificity of RNA interference verified by 5' RACE-PCR and Western blot analysis of protein.","1878-5905","Biomaterials","(35) 8406-15",2014,"Aristides D","Tagalakis","AD","Molecular Immunology Unit, UCL Institute of Child Health, 30 Guilford Street, London, WC1N 1EH, UK.

We investigated the effects of C-glycosylation on the antioxidant, anti-Alzheimer's disease (AD), anti-diabetic and anti-inflammatory effects of luteolin and its two C-glycosides via in vitro assays of peroxynitrite (ONOO(-)), total reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO), 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydraxyl (DPPH), aldose reductase, protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), and β-site amyloid precursor cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), and cellular assays of NO production and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)/cyclooxygenase-2 expression in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. Of the three compounds, isoorientin showed the highest scavenging activity against DPPH, NO, and ONOO(-), while luteolin was the most potent inhibitor of ROS generation. In addition, luteolin showed the most potent anti-AD activity as determined by its inhibition of AChE, BChE, and BACE1. With respect to anti-diabetic effects, luteolin exerted the strongest inhibitory activity against PTP1B and rat lens aldose reductase. Luteolin also inhibited NO production and iNOS protein expression in LPS-stimulated macrophages, while orientin and isoorientin were inactive at the same concentrations. The effects of C-glycosylation at different positions of luteolin may be closely linked to the intensity and modulation of antioxidant, anti-AD, anti-diabetic, and anti-inflammatory effects of luteolin and its C-glycosylated derivatives.

24992504,"Genetic inhibition of phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2α does not block Aβ-dependent elevation of BACE1 and APP levels or reduce amyloid pathology in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.","β-site amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) initiates the production of β-amyloid (Aβ), the major constituent of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD). BACE1 is elevated ∼2-3 fold in AD brain and is concentrated in dystrophic neurites near plaques, suggesting BACE1 elevation is Aβ-dependent. Previously, we showed that phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2α de-represses translation of BACE1 mRNA following stress such as energy deprivation. We hypothesized that stress induced by Aβ might increase BACE1 levels by the same translational mechanism involving eIF2α phosphorylation. To test this hypothesis, we used three different genetic strategies to determine the effects of reducing eIF2α phosphorylation on Aβ-dependent BACE1 elevation in vitro and in vivo: 1) a two-vector adeno-associated virus (AAV) system to express constitutively active GADD34, the regulatory subunit of PP1c eIF2α phosphatase; 2) a non-phosphorylatable eIF2α S51A knockin mutation; 3) a BACE1-YFP transgene lacking the BACE1 mRNA 5' untranslated region (UTR) required for eIF2α translational regulation. The first two strategies were used in primary neurons and 5XFAD transgenic mice, while the third strategy was employed only in 5XFAD mice. Despite very effective reduction of eIF2α phosphorylation in both primary neurons and 5XFAD brains, or elimination of eIF2α-mediated regulation of BACE1-YFP mRNA translation in 5XFAD brains, Aβ-dependent BACE1 elevation was not decreased. Additionally, robust inhibition of eIF2α phosphorylation did not block Aβ-dependent APP elevation in primary neurons, nor did it reduce amyloid pathology in 5XFAD mice. We conclude that amyloid-associated BACE1 elevation is not caused by translational de-repression via eIF2α phosphorylation, but instead appears to involve a post-translational mechanism. These definitive genetic results exclude a role for eIF2α phosphorylation in Aβ-dependent BACE1 and APP elevation. We suggest a vicious pathogenic cycle wherein Aβ42 toxicity induces peri-plaque BACE1 and APP accumulation in dystrophic neurites leading to exacerbated Aβ production and plaque progression.

Diabetic patients with dysregulated insulin signalling are at increased risk of developing AD. Further, several animal models of diabetes show increased Aβ expression and hyperphosphorylated tau. As we have shown recently, the anti-diabetic drug metformin is capable of dephosphorylating tau at AD-relevant phospho-sites. Here, we investigated the effect of metformin on the main amyloidogenic enzyme BACE1 and, thus, on the production of Aβ peptides, the second pathological hallmark of AD. We find similar results in cultures of primary neurons, a human cell line model of AD and in vivo in mice. We show that treatment with metformin decreases BACE1 protein expression by interfering with an mRNA-protein complex that contains the ubiquitin ligase MID1, thereby reducing BACE1 activity. Together with our previous findings these results indicate that metformin may target both pathological hallmarks of AD and may be of therapeutic value for treating and/or preventing AD.

Because there is no cure other than delivery, preeclampsia is the leading cause of iatrogenic preterm birth. We show that preeclampsia shares pathophysiologic features with recognized protein misfolding disorders. These features include urine congophilia (affinity for the amyloidophilic dye Congo red), affinity for conformational state-dependent antibodies, and dysregulation of prototype proteolytic enzymes involved in amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing. Assessment of global protein misfolding load in pregnancy based on urine congophilia (Congo red dot test) carries diagnostic and prognostic potential for preeclampsia. We used conformational state-dependent antibodies to demonstrate the presence of generic supramolecular assemblies (prefibrillar oligomers and annular protofibrils), which vary in quantitative and qualitative representation with preeclampsia severity. In the first attempt to characterize the preeclampsia misfoldome, we report that the urine congophilic material includes proteoforms of ceruloplasmin, immunoglobulin free light chains, SERPINA1, albumin, interferon-inducible protein 6-16, and Alzheimer's β-amyloid. The human placenta abundantly expresses APP along with prototype APP-processing enzymes, of which the α-secretase ADAM10, the β-secretases BACE1 and BACE2, and the γ-secretase presenilin-1 were all up-regulated in preeclampsia. The presence of β-amyloid aggregates in placentas of women with preeclampsia and fetal growth restriction further supports the notion that this condition should join the growing list of protein conformational disorders. If these aggregates play a pathophysiologic role, our findings may lead to treatment for preeclampsia.

25048970,"Oxidized LDL lipids increase β-amyloid production by SH-SY5Y cells through glutathione depletion and lipid raft formation.","Elevated total cholesterol in midlife has been associated with increased risk of dementia in later life. We have previously shown that low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is more oxidized in the plasma of dementia patients, although total cholesterol levels are not different from those of age-matched controls. β-Amyloid (Aβ) peptide, which accumulates in Alzheimer disease (AD), arises from the initial cleavage of amyloid precursor protein by β-secretase-1 (BACE1). BACE1 activity is regulated by membrane lipids and raft formation. Given the evidence for altered lipid metabolism in AD, we have investigated a mechanism for enhanced Aβ production by SH-SY5Y neuronal-like cells exposed to oxidized LDL (oxLDL). The viability of SH-SY5Y cells exposed to 4μg oxLDL and 25µM 27-hydroxycholesterol (27OH-C) was decreased significantly. Lipids, but not proteins, extracted from oxLDL were more cytotoxic than oxLDL. In parallel, the ratio of reduced glutathione (GSH) to oxidized glutathione was decreased at sublethal concentrations of lipids extracted from native and oxLDL. GSH loss was associated with an increase in acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase) activity and lipid raft formation, which could be inhibited by the ASMase inhibitor desipramine. 27OH-C and total lipids from LDL and oxLDL independently increased Aβ production by SH-SY5Y cells, and Aβ accumulation could be inhibited by desipramine and by N-acetylcysteine. These data suggest a mechanism whereby oxLDL lipids and 27OH-C can drive Aβ production by GSH depletion, ASMase-driven membrane remodeling, and BACE1 activation in neuronal cells.","1873-4596","Free radical biology & medicine","(75) 48-59",2014,"Irundika H K","Dias","IH","Life and Health Sciences and Aston Research Centre for Healthy Ageing, Aston University, Birmingham, West Midlands B4 7ET, UK."

While previous studies have suggested that histone hypoacetylation may regulate the expression of genes associated with memory and learning in AD, little is known about histone regulation of AD-related genes such as Presenilin 1(PS1) and beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1(BACE1). By utilizing neuroblastoma N2a cells transfected with Swedish mutated human amyloid precursor protein (APP) (N2a/APPswe) and wild-type APP (N2a/APPwt) as cellular models of AD, we examined the alterations of histone acetylation at the promoter regions of PS1 and BACE1 in these cells. Our results revealed that histone H3 acetylation in PS1 and BACE1 promoters is markedly increased in N2a/APPswe cells when compared to N2a/APPwt cells and control cells (vector-transfected), respectively, causing the elevated expression of PS1 and BACE1. In addition, expression of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) adenoviral E1A-associated 300-kDa protein (p300) is dramatically enhanced in N2a/APPswe cells compared to N2a/APPwt and control cells. We have further demonstrated the direct binding of p300 protein to the PS1 and BACE1 promoters in N2a/APPswe cells. The expression levels of H3 acetylation of the PS1 and BACE1 promoters and p300 protein, however, were found to be not significantly different in N2a/APPwt cells when compared to controls in our studies. Furthermore, curcumin, a natural selective inhibitor of p300 in HATs, significantly suppressed the expression of PS1 and BACE1 through inhibition of H3 acetylation in their promoter regions in N2a/APPswe cells. These findings indicated that histone acetyltransferase p300 plays a critical role in controlling the expression of AD-related genes through regulating the acetylation of their promoter regions, suggesting that p300 may represent a novel potential therapeutic target for AD.

However, the underlying mechanisms are not understood. This study investigated the effect of methylmercury (MeHg) treatment on the generation, degradation, and transport of amyloid β-protein (Aβ) in the brain. Wistar rats were administered MeHg by gavage (0, 20, 200, and 2,000 μg Hg/kg/day) for 4 weeks. The total Hg in the blood and brain regions was measured, and the levels of Aβ42 in plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and brain regions were estimated. The expression of amyloid precursor protein (APP), beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), and neprilysin (NEP) in the brain regions was determined, in addition to the expression of low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) and the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) in the brain capillary endothelium (BCE). Finally, the amount of soluble low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (sLRP) in the plasma was determined. Aβ42 levels were decreased in the CSF of the 2,000 μg Hg/kg/day group compared with controls, and Aβ42 levels increased in the hippocampus (HC) in a dose-dependent manner. MeHg decreased LRP1 expression but increased RAGE levels in BCE. sLRP levels were decreased in the plasma of the MeHg-treated rats. They were positively correlated with CSF Aβ42 and negatively correlated with Aβ42 and Hg levels in HC. These results imply that MeHg reduces the transportation of Aβ, thereby resulting in the accumulation of the protein in the HC. Plasma sLRP levels may be an early biomarker of Hg-induced Aβ accumulation in the brain.","1880-3989","The Journal of toxicological sciences","(39) 625-35",2014,"Dong-Kyeong","Kim","DK","Department of Preventive Medicine, College of Medicine, Chung-Ang University."
25058312,"Dual blockade of the A1 and A2A adenosine receptor prevents amyloid beta toxicity in neuroblastoma cells exposed to aluminum chloride.","In a previous work we have shown that exposure to aluminum (Al) chloride (AlCl3) enhanced the neurotoxicity of the amyloid beta(25-35) fragment (Abeta(25-35)) in neuroblastoma cells and affected the expression of Alzheimer's disease (AD)-related genes. Caffein, a compound endowed with beneficial effects against AD, exerts neuroprotection primarily through its antagonist activity on A2A adenosine receptors (A2AR), although it also inhibits A1Rs with similar potency. Still, studies on the specific involvement of these receptors in neuroprotection in a model of combined neurotoxicity (Abeta(25-35)+AlCl3) are missing. To address this issue, cultured SH-SY5Y cells exposed to Abeta(25-35)+AlCl3 were assessed for cell viability, morphology, intracellular ROS activity and expression of apoptosis-, stress- and AD-related proteins. To define the role of A1R and A2ARs, pretreatment with caffein, specific receptor antagonists (DPCPX or SCH58261) or siRNA-mediated gene knockdown were delivered. Results indicate that AlCl3 treatment exacerbated Abeta(25-35) toxicity, increased ROS production, lipid peroxidation, β-secretase-1 (BACE1) and amyloid precursor protein (APP). Interestingly, SCH58261 successfully prevented toxicity associated to Abeta(25-35) only, whereas pretreatment with both DPCPX and SCH58261 was required to fully avert Abeta(25-35)+AlCl3-induced damage, suggesting that A1Rs might also be critically involved in protection during combined toxicity. The effects of caffein were mimicked by both N-acetyl cysteine, an antioxidant, and desferrioxamine, likely acting through distinct mechanisms. Altogether, our data establish a novel protective function associated with A1R inhibition in the setting of combined Abeta(25-35)+AlCl3 neurotoxicity, and expand our current knowledge on the potential beneficial role of caffein to prevent AD progression in subjects environmentally exposed to aluminum.","1878-5875","The international journal of biochemistry & cell biology","(54) 122-36",2014,"Salvatore","Giunta","S","Department of Bio-Medical Sciences, Section of Anatomy and Histology, University of Catania, Italy."

Cognitive impairments and increased levels of hyperphosphorylated tau are found in the hippocampus of SAMP8 mice along with an increased β-secretase activity and amyloid-β (Aβ) depositions that increase in number and extent with age. Based on a previous study from our laboratory showing an amelioration of cognitive impairments and tau pathology by sildenafil, in this study we tested whether this drug could also modulate the amyloid precursor protein amyloidogenic processing in this mouse model. Our results show that the protein levels of the β-secretases β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 and cathepsin B are higher in the hippocampus of 9-month-old SAMP8 mice than those of age-matched senescence-resistant-1. Sildenafil (7.5mg/kg for 4 weeks) attenuated learning and memory impairments shown by SAMP8 mice in the passive avoidance test. The increased expression of β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 was also reduced by sildenafil, an effect paralleled to decreases in the activities of two β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 modulators, calpain and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 protein. Interestingly, sildenafil enhanced both Akt and glycogen synthase kinase-3β (ser9) phosphorylation, which could be mediating the reduction in cathepsin B levels found in the hippocampus of sildenafil-treated SAMP8 mice. Sildenafil-induced reduction in β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 and cathepsin B expression in SAMP8 mice was associated with a decrease in hippocampal Aβ42 levels which, in turn, could mediate the parallel decline in glial fibrillary acidic protein expression observed in these animals.

To avoid pitfalls of existing models, we introduced hbace1 via knock-in under the control of the CaMKII α promoter into the safe HPRT locus. We report amyloidogenic processing of murine APP in the hBACE1 mice (termed PLB4), resulting in the formation of toxic APP metabolites that accumulate intra- and extraneuronally in hippocampus and cortex. Pronounced accumulation of Aβ*56 and Aβ hexamers in the absence of plaque deposition was detected in brain tissue from symptomatic PLB4 mice. Heightened levels of inflammation (gliosis) also appeared in several AD-related brain regions (dentate gyrus, hippocampal area CA1, piriform and parietal cortices) at 6 and 12 months of age. Behaviorally, deficits in habituation to a novel environment and semantic-like memory (social transmission of food preference) were detected from 3 to 4 months of age.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a staggering number of 35.6 million people are currently diagnosed with dementia. Blocking disease progression or preventing AD altogether is desirable for both social and economic reasons and recently focus has shifted to a new and promising drug: the β-secretase inhibitor. Much of AD research has investigated the amyloid cascade hypothesis, which postulates that AD is caused by changes in amyloid beta (Aβ) stability and aggregation. Blocking Aβ production by inhibiting the first protease required for its generation, β-secretase/BACE1, may be the next step in blocking AD progression. In April 2012, promising phase I data on inhibitor MK-8931 was presented. This drug reduced Aβ cerebral spinal fluids (CSF) levels up to 92% and was well tolerated by patients. In March 2013 data was added from a one week trial in 32 mild to moderate AD patients, showing CSF Aβ levels decreased up to 84%. However, β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) inhibitors require further research. First, greatly reducing Aβ levels through BACE1 inhibition may have harmful side effects. Second, BACE1 inhibitors have yet to pass clinical trial phase II/III and no data on possible side effects on AD patients are available. And third, there remains doubt about the clinical efficacy of BACE1 inhibitors. In moderate AD patients, Aβ plaques have already been formed. BACE1 inhibitors prevent production of new Aβ plaques, but hypothetically do not influence already existing Aβ peptides. Therefore, BACE1 inhibitors are potentially better at preventing AD instead of having therapeutic use.

These residual cognitive impairments may involve aberrant deposition of amyloid β-peptides (Aβ). By unknown mechanisms, Aβ accumulates in the lysosomal and autophagic compartments of neurons in the HIV-infected brain. Here we identify the molecular events evoked by the HIV coat protein gp120 that facilitate the intraneuronal accumulation of Aβ. We created a triple transgenic gp120/APP/PS1 mouse that recapitulates intraneuronal deposition of Aβ in a manner reminiscent of the HIV-infected brain. In cultured neurons, we found that the HIV coat protein gp120 increased the transcriptional expression of BACE1 through repression of PPARγ, and increased APP expression by promoting interaction of the translation-activating RBP heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein C with APP mRNA. APP and BACE1 were colocalized into stabilized membrane microdomains, where the β-cleavage of APP and Aβ formation were enhanced. Aβ-peptides became localized to lysosomes that were engorged with sphingomyelin and calcium. Stimulating calcium efflux from lysosomes with a TRPM1 agonist promoted calcium efflux, luminal acidification, and cleared both sphingomyelin and Aβ from lysosomes. These findings suggest that therapeutics targeted to reduce lysosomal pH in neurodegenerative conditions may protect neurons by facilitating the clearance of accumulated sphingolipids and Aβ-peptides.

By means of steady-state fluorescence polarization analyses using two environment-sensitive fluorescent probes, we demonstrate that lipid rafts from cerebellum, and frontal and entorhinal cortices, exhibit different biophysical behaviors depending on the stage of the disease. Thus, while membrane anisotropies were similar in the cerebellum along stages, lipid rafts from frontal and entorhinal cortices at AD stages I/II and AD III were significantly more liquid-ordered than in control subjects, both at the aqueous interface and hydrophobic core of the raft membrane. Thermotropic analyses demonstrated the presence of Arrhenius breakpoints between 28.3-32.0 °C, which were not influenced by the disease stage. However, analyses of membrane microviscosity (ηapp) demonstrate that frontal and entorhinal lipid rafts are notably more viscous and liquid-ordered all across the membrane from early stages of the disease. These physicochemical alterations in lipid rafts do not correlate with changes in cholesterol or sphingomyelin levels, but to reduced unsaturation index and increased saturate/polyunsaturated ratios in phospholipid acyl chains. Moreover, we demonstrate that β-secretase/AβPP (amyloid-β protein precursor) interaction and lipid raft microviscosity are strongly, and positively, correlated in AD frontal and entorhinal cortices. These observations strengthens the hypothesis that physical properties of these microdomains modulate the convergence of amyloidogenic machinery toward lipid rafts, and also points to a critical role of polyunsaturated fatty acids in amyloidogenic processing of AβPP.","1875-8908","Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD","(43) 1185-98",2015,"Mario","Díaz","M","Departamento de Biología Animal, Universidad de La Laguna, Tenerife, Spain."
25156639,"Revisiting the peripheral sink hypothesis: inhibiting BACE1 activity in the periphery does not alter β-amyloid levels in the CNS.","Aggregation of amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides and the subsequent neural plaque formation is a central aspect of Alzheimer's disease. Various strategies to reduce Aβ load in the brain are therefore intensely pursued. It has been hypothesized that reducing Aβ peptides in the periphery, that is in organs outside the brain, would be a way to diminish Aβ levels and plaque load in the brain. In this report, we put this peripheral sink hypothesis to test by investigating how selective inhibition of Aβ production in the periphery using a β-secretase (BACE)1 inhibitor or reduced BACE1 gene dosage affects Aβ load in the brain. Selective inhibition of peripheral BACE1 activity in wild-type mice or mice over-expressing amyloid precursor protein (APPswe transgenic mice; Tg2576) reduced Aβ levels in the periphery but not in the brain, not even after chronic treatment over several months. In contrast, a BACE1 inhibitor with improved brain disposition reduced Aβ levels in both brain and periphery already after acute dosing. Mice heterozygous for BACE1, displayed a 62% reduction in plasma Aβ40, whereas brain Aβ40 was only lowered by 11%. These data suggest that reduction of Aβ in the periphery is not sufficient to reduce brain Aβ levels and that BACE1 is not the rate-limiting enzyme for Aβ processing in the brain. This provides evidence against the peripheral sink hypothesis and suggests that a decrease in Aβ via BACE1 inhibition would need to be carried out in the brain. Aggregation of amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides in the brain is a central aspect of Alzheimer's disease. In this study, we demonstrate that inhibition of Aβ formation by BACE1 inhibitors needs to be carried out in the brain and that reduction of Aβ in the periphery is not sufficient to reduce brain Aβ levels. This information is useful for developing future Aβ-targeting therapies for Alzheimer's disease.

Evidence suggested that in addition to Aβ, βCTF might also participate in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). In recent years, the relationship between βCTF processing and hyperphosphorylated tau has attracted increasing research attention. In this study, we established an animal model of tau hyperphosphorylation with okadaic acid (OA) treatment, and analyzed βCTF processing in vivo. The βCTF level was found to increase in neurons, which was most likely caused by the induction of OA and BACE1 overexpression. Furthermore, these results provide the first evidence that βCTF can predominately accumulate in the axons of neurons in a hyperphosphorylated tau state in vivo, and suggested that the redistribution of βCTF is involved in the pathogenesis of AD. These results indicate that BACE1 could be a therapeutic target of AD by affecting the processing of βCTF.","1676-5680","Genetics and molecular research : GMR","(13) 6213-27",2014,"H Y","Chen","HY","Department of Neurology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang, China."

Depending on the age of onset, AD is clinically categorized into either the early-onset form (before age 60years old), or the late-onset form (after age 65years old), with the vast majority of AD diagnosed as late onset (LOAD). LOAD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that involves the accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles in the brains of elderly patients. Affected individuals often experience symptoms including memory loss, confusion, and behavioral changes. Though many animal models of AD exist, very few are capable of analyzing the effect of older age on AD pathology. In an attempt to better model LOAD, we developed a novel ""aged AD"" model using Drosophila melanogaster. In our model, we express low levels of the human AD proteins APP (amyloid precursor protein) and BACE1 (β-site APP cleaving enzyme BACE) specifically in the fly's central nervous system. Advantages of our model include the onset of behavioral and neuropathological symptoms later in the fly's lifespan due to a gradual accrual of Aβ within the central nervous system (CNS), making age the key factor in the behavioral and neuroanatomical phenotypes that we observe in this model.

In the present study, the effects of luteolin on chronic cerebral hypoperfusion-associated neurocognitive pathologies were investigated by using rats with permanent bilateral common carotid artery occlusion, a rat model of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion. As expected, we found that luteolin could attenuate cognitive dysfunction in chronic cerebral hypoperfused rats, as assessed using Morris water maze tests. Daily oral administration of luteolin (50, 100 and 200mg/kg) significantly scavenged oxygen free radicals, enhanced antioxidant potential, decreased the lipid peroxide production and suppressed inflammatory reaction in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus induced by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion. Meanwhile, the results indicated that cerebral hypoperfusion activated nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), increased the expression of β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme (BACE1), as well as elevated amyloid beta (Aβ) levels in the cortex and hippocampus. However, long-term administration of luteolin significantly down-regulated the expression of NF-κB and BACE1, accompanied by diminishing the deposition of Aβ.

Since many of these disease models involve transgenic mice that are frequently aged and fragile, the commonly used oro-gastric gavage method of drug administration often confounds measured outcomes due to repeated stress and high attrition rates caused by esophageal complications. We employed a novel drug formulation in a peanut butter (PB) pellet readily consumed by mice and compared the stress response as measured by plasma corticosterone levels relative to oral administration via traditional gavage. Acute gavage produced significant elevations in plasma corticosterone comparable to those observed in mice subjected to stress-induced hyperthermia. In contrast, corticosterone levels following consumption of PB pellets were similar to levels in naive mice and significantly lower than in mice subjected to traditional gavage. Following sub-chronic administration, corticosterone levels remained significantly higher in mice subjected to gavage, relative to mice administered PB pellets or naive controls. Furthermore, chronic 30day dosing of a BACE inhibitor administered via PB pellets to PSAPP mice resulted in expected plasma drug exposure and Aβ40 lowering consistent with drug treatment demonstrating target engagement. Taken together, this alternative method of oral administration by drug formulated in PB pellets results in the expected pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics with attenuated stress levels, and is devoid of the detrimental effects of repetitive oral gavage.","1873-5177","Pharmacology, biochemistry, and behavior","(126) 28-35",2014,"C","Gonzales","C","Neuroscience, Wyeth Research (currently Pfizer Inc.), Princeton, NJ, USA; Neuroscience Research Unit, Pfizer Inc., 448 Eastern Point Road, Groton, CT 06340, USA.

Although mutations in APP and genes that regulate processing of APP, such as PSENs and BRI2/ITM2B, cause dementias, the normal function of APP in synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity and memory formation is poorly understood. To grasp the biochemical mechanisms underlying the function of APP in the central nervous system, it is important to first define the sub-cellular localization of APP in synapses and the synaptic interactome of APP. Using biochemical and electron microscopy approaches, we have found that APP is localized in pre-synaptic vesicles, where it is processed by Bace1. By means of a proteomic approach, we have characterized the synaptic interactome of the APP intracellular domain. We focused on this region of APP because in vivo data underline the central functional and pathological role of the intracellular domain of APP. Consistent with the expression of APP in pre-synaptic vesicles, the synaptic APP intracellular domain interactome is predominantly constituted by pre-synaptic, rather than post-synaptic, proteins. This pre-synaptic interactome of the APP intracellular domain includes proteins expressed on pre-synaptic vesicles such as the vesicular SNARE Vamp2/Vamp1 and the Ca2+ sensors Synaptotagmin-1/Synaptotagmin-2, and non-vesicular pre-synaptic proteins that regulate exocytosis, endocytosis and recycling of pre-synaptic vesicles, such as target-membrane-SNAREs (Syntaxin-1b, Syntaxin-1a, Snap25 and Snap47), Munc-18, Nsf, α/β/γ-Snaps and complexin.

(2012) Nature 488, 96-99). The Ala-673 residue lies within the β-secretase recognition sequence and is part of the amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide cleavage product (position 2 of Aβ). We previously demonstrated that the A673T substitution makes APP a less favorable substrate for cleavage by BACE1. In follow-up studies, we confirm that A673T APP shows reduced cleavage by BACE1 in transfected mouse primary neurons and in isogenic human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neurons. Using a biochemical approach, we show that the A673T substitution modulates the catalytic turnover rate (V(max)) of APP by the BACE1 enzyme, without affecting the affinity (K(m)) of the APP substrate for BACE1. We also show a reduced level of Aβ(1-42) aggregation with A2T Aβ peptides, an observation not conserved in Aβ(1-40) peptides. When combined in a ratio of 1:9 Aβ(1-42)/Aβ(1-40) to mimic physiologically relevant mixtures, A2T retains a trend toward slowed aggregation kinetics. Microglial uptake of the mutant Aβ(1-42) peptides correlated with their aggregation level. Cytotoxicity of the mutant Aβ peptides was not dramatically altered. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that A673T, a protective allele of APP, reproducibly reduces amyloidogenic processing of APP and also mildly decreases Aβ aggregation. These effects could together have an additive or even synergistic impact on the risk of developing AD.","1083-351X","The Journal of biological chemistry","(289) 30990-1000",2014,"Janice A","Maloney","JA","From the Departments of Neuroscience."

Aβ peptides are produced by sequential cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein by the β amyloid cleaving enzyme (BACE) and the γ-secretase (γ-sec) complex. Pharmacological treatments that decrease brain levels of in particular the toxic Aβ42 peptide are thought to be promising approaches for AD disease modification. Potent and selective BACE1 inhibitors as well as γ-sec modulators (GSMs) have been designed. Pharmacological intervention of secretase function is not without risks of either on- or off-target adverse effects. One way of improving the therapeutic window could be to combine treatment on multiple targets, using smaller individual doses and thereby minimizing adverse effect liability. We show that combined treatment of primary cortical neurons with a BACE1 inhibitor and a GSM gives an additive effect on Aβ42 level change compared with the individual treatments. We extend this finding to C57BL/6 mice, where the combined treatment results in reduction of brain Aβ42 levels reflecting the sum of the individual treatment efficacies. These results show that pharmacological targeting of two amyloid precursor protein processing steps is feasible without negatively interfering with the mechanism of action on individual targets.

The modifications in the flap, third strand, and insert F regions were found to be involved in the alteration in the site specificity of the glycosylphosphatidylinositol bound form of BACE1. Our QM and QM/MM calculations suggested that BACE1 hydrolyzed the SW-substrate more efficiently than the WT-substrate and that cleavage of the peptide bond occurred in the rate-determining step.

The study has explored a possible link between the treatment of Depression and AD. 'Autodock 4.2' was used for docking study. The free energy of binding (ΔG) values for 'levomilnacipran-SERT' interaction and 'levomilnacipran-BACE1' interaction were found to be -7.47 and -8.25 kcal/mol, respectively. Levomilnacipran was found to interact with S438, known to be the most important amino acid residue of serotonin binding site of SERT during 'levomilnacipran-SERT' interaction. In the case of 'levomilnacipran-BACE1' interaction, levomilnacipran interacted with two very crucial aspartic acid residues of BACE-1, namely, D32 and D228. These residues are accountable for the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein and the subsequent formation of amyloid β plaques in AD brain. Hence, Fetzima (levomilnacipran) might act as a potent dual inhibitor of SERT and BACE-1 and expected to form the basis of a future dual therapy against depression and AD. It is an established fact that development of AD is associated with Major Depressive Disorder. Therefore, the design of new BACE-1 inhibitors based on antidepressant drug scaffolds would be particularly beneficial.

Hierarchical clustering and pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs were performed using pheatmap package of R language and KOBAS software, respectively. miRNAs related to up- and down-regulated DEGs were, respectively, predicted by WebGestalt software and its miRNAs-target DEGs interaction network were, respectively, constructed by STRING database. Bingo plug-in in Cytoscape software was applied to analyze Gene Ontology functional enrichment analysis for up- and down-regulated DEGs in network, respectively. A total of 428 DEGs were selected, including 331 down-regulated and 97 up-regulated DEGs. Hierarchical clustering analysis showed that glioma samples and normal samples were completely separated. Pathway analysis indicated that CDK2 and WEE1 participated in the cell cycle. miR-124 could simultaneously regulate up-regulated (ELAVL1 and EZH2) and down-regulated (BACE1) DEGs. The down-regulated genes (KIF23, WEE1 and CDK2) were associated with cell division, while the up-regulated genes (PLP1 and MBP) were related to myelination of neurons. miR-124 might participate in development of glioma by regulating BACE1, ELAVL1 and EZH2.

25359283,"Two novel DNA motifs are essential for BACE1 gene transcription.","BACE1 gene encodes for β-Site amyloid β precursor protein (APP)-cleaving enzyme1, which is required for generating amyloid β protein(Aβ). Deposition of Aβ in brain plays an essential role in Alzheimer's Disease (AD) pathogenesis. BACE1 gene has a tissue-specific expression pattern and its expression is tightly regulated at transcriptional level. Core promoter is a minimal DNA sequence to direct transcription initiation and serves as a converging platform for the vast network of regulatory events. Here we identified the core promoter of human BACE1 gene, which is a 71 nucleotides region absent of typical known core promoter elements and is sufficient to initiate a basal transcription. Two novel DNA motifs, designated TCE1 and TCE2, were found to be involved in activating the transcription of human BACE1 gene in a synergistic way. Two single nucleotide mutations in these motifs completely abolished the promoter activity. In conclusion, our studies have demonstrated that novel DNA motif TCE1 and TCE2 in human BACE1 gene promoter are two essential cis-acting elements for BACE1 gene transcription. Studies on how these two motifs being regulated by different stimuli could provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying AD pathogenesis and pharmaceutical potentials of targeting these motifs for AD treatment.

In the course of development of a novel small molecule BACE1 inhibitor (AMG-8718), retinal thinning was observed in a 1-month toxicity study in the rat. To further understand the lesion, an investigational study was conducted whereby rats were treated daily with AMG-8718 for 1 month followed by a 2-month treatment-free phase. The earliest detectable change in the retina was an increase in autofluorescent granules in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) on day 5; however, there were no treatment-related light microscopic changes observed in the neuroretina and no changes observed by fundus autofluorescence or routine ophthalmoscopic examination after 28 days of dosing. Following 2 months of recovery, there was significant retinal thinning attributed to loss of photoreceptor nuclei from the outer nuclear layer. Electroretinographic changes were observed as early as day 14, before any microscopic evidence of photoreceptor loss. BACE1 knockout rats were generated and found to have normal retinal morphology indicating that the retinal toxicity induced by AMG-8718 was likely off-target. These results suggest that AMG-8718 impairs phagolysosomal function in the rat RPE, which leads to photoreceptor dysfunction and ultimately loss of photoreceptors.

25376768,"Complementary roles of the neuron-enriched endosomal proteins NEEP21 and calcyon in neuronal vesicle trafficking.","Understanding mechanisms governing the trafficking of transmembrane (TM) cargoes to synapses and other specialized membranes in neurons represents a long-standing challenge in cell biology. Investigation of the neuron-enriched endosomal protein of 21 kDa (NEEP21, or NSG1or P21) and Calcyon (Caly, or NSG3) indicates that the emergence of the NEEP21/Caly/P19 gene family could play a vital role in the success of these mechanisms in vertebrates. The upshot of a sizeable body of work is that the NEEP21 and Caly perform distinct endocytic and recycling functions, which impact (i) α amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid-type glutamate receptor trafficking at excitatory synapses; (ii) transport to/in neuronal axons; as well as (iii) proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein and neuregulin 1, suggesting roles in neuron development, synaptic function, and neurodegeneration. We argue that their distinct effects on cargo endocytosis and recycling depend on interactions with vesicle trafficking and synaptic scaffolding proteins. As they play complementary, but opposing roles in cargo endocytosis, recycling, and degradation, balancing NEEP21 and Caly expression levels or activity could be important for homeostasis in a variety of signaling pathways, and also lead to a novel therapeutic strategy for disorders like Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia. This review focuses on two closely related, neuron-enriched endosomal proteins: NEEP21 and Calcyon which perform distinct roles in regulating receptor endocytosis, recycling, and degradation. Based on an in-depth examination of the literature, we argue that these two proteins carry out complementary yet sometimes opposing vesicle trafficking functions that impact excitatory transmission, transcytosis, axonal transport, and also proteolytic processing by beta-secretase I (BACE1). Finally, we propose that balancing NEEP21 and Calcyon expression and/or activity could be important for homeostasis in a variety of signaling pathways, and also lead to a novel therapeutic strategy for disorders like Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia.

25378159,"Synaptic and cognitive improvements by inhibition of 2-AG metabolism are through upregulation of microRNA-188-3p in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.","Abnormal accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) is the major neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the mechanisms underlying aberrant Aβ formation in AD remain unclear. We showed previously that inhibition of monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), the primary enzyme that metabolizes the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) in the brain, robustly reduces Aβ by inhibiting β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), a key enzyme responsible for Aβ formation. However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for suppression of BACE1 by inhibition of 2-AG metabolism are largely unknown. We demonstrate here that expression of the noncoding small RNA miR-188-3p that targets BACE1 was significantly downregulated both in the brains of AD humans and APP transgenic (TG) mice, a mouse model of AD. The downregulated miR-188-3p expression was restored by MAGL inhibition. Overexpression of miR-188-3p in the hippocampus reduced BACE1, Aβ, and neuroinflammation and prevented deteriorations in hippocampal basal synaptic transmission, long-term potentiation, spatial learning, and memory in TG mice. 2-AG-induced suppression of BACE1 was prevented by miR-188-3p loss of function. Moreover, miR-188-3p expression was upregulated by 2-AG or peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) agonists and suppressed by PPARγ antagonism or NF-κB activation. Reducing Aβ and neuroinflammation by MAGL inhibition was occluded by PPARγ antagonism. In addition, BACE1 suppression by 2-AG and PPARγ activation was eliminated by knockdown of NF-κB. Our study provides a novel molecular mechanism underlying improved synaptic and cognitive function in TG mice by 2-AG signaling, which upregulates miR-188-3p expression through PPARγ and NF-κB signaling pathway, resulting in suppressions of BACE1 expression and Aβ formation.","1529-2401","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","(34) 14919-33",2014,"Jian","Zhang","J","Neuroscience Center of Excellence."

In this study, activation of the Wnt pathway by overexpression of the agonist Wnt3a or β-catenin or by inhibition of glycogen kinase synthase-3 in N2a cells resulted in a reduction in Aβ levels and in the activity and expression of BACE1 (β-APP cleaving enzyme). Conversely, inhibition of the pathway by transfection of the antagonists secreted frizzled receptor protein-1 or dickkopf-1 produced the opposite effects. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis demonstrated that β-catenin binds specifically to regions within the promoter of BACE1 containing putative T-cell factor/lymphoid enhancer binding factor-1 (TCF/LEF) motifs, consistent with canonical Wnt target regulation. Furthermore, cells transfected with β-catenin mutants incapable of binding to TCF/LEF increased BACE1 gene promoter activity. Interestingly, TCF4 knockdown reversed the effects of Wnt3a activation on BACE1 transcription. We found that TCF4 binds to the same region on BACE1 promoter following Wnt3a stimulation, indicating that TCF4 functions as a transcriptional repressor of BACE1 gene. In conclusion, Wnt/β-catenin stimulation may repress BACE1 transcription via binding of TCF4 to BACE1 gene, and therefore, activation of the Wnt pathway may hold the key to new treatments of Alzheimer disease.-Parr, C., Mirzaei, N., Christian, M., and Sastre, M.

While the introduction of polar groups was effective in reducing hERG binding affinity, this came at the expense of higher than desired Pgp-mediated efflux. A balance of low Pgp efflux and hERG activity was achieved by lowering the polar surface area of the P3 substituent while retaining polarity in the P2' side chain. The introduction of a fluorine in position 4 of the xanthene ring improved BACE1 potency (5-10-fold). The combination of these optimized fragments resulted in identification of compound 40, which showed robust Aβ reduction in a rat pharmacodynamic model (78% Aβ reduction in CSF at 10 mg/kg po) and also showed acceptable cardiovascular safety in vivo.

The decrease in Aβ deposition was associated with a reduction in the expression of BACE1, the main enzyme responsible for Aβ generation. These results were confirmed in a neuroblastoma cell line, which demonstrated that incubation with FGF2 regulates BACE1 transcription.

In both Ts65Dn mice and their normosomic (2N) controls, JZL184-treatment increased brain levels of 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) and decreased levels of its metabolites such as arachidonic acid, prostaglandins PGD2, PGE2, PGFα, and PGJ2. Enhanced spontaneous locomotor activity of Ts65Dn mice was reduced by the JZL184-treatement to the levels observed in 2N animals. Deficient long-term memory was also improved, while short-term and working types of memory were unaffected. Furthermore, reduced hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) was increased in the JZL184-treated Ts65Dn mice to the levels observed in 2N mice.

However, recent investigations using genetic animal models raise concern that therapeutic BACE1 inhibition may encounter the dramatic reduction of efficacy in ameliorating AD-like pathology and memory deficits during disease progression. Here, we compared the effects of the potent and selective small-molecule BACE1 inhibitor GRL-8234 in different pathological stages of AD mouse model. Specifically, we administered GRL-8234 (33.4 mg/kg, i.p.) once daily for 2 months to 5XFAD transgenic mice, which showed modest (4 months) and massive (10 months of age) Aβ plaque deposition at starting points. Chronic treatments with GRL-8234 reversed memory impairments, as tested by the spontaneous alternation Y-maze task, in the younger 5XFAD group concomitant with significant reductions in cerebral Aβ42 levels. In contrast, only marginal reductions of Aβ42 were observed in 12-month-old 5XFAD mice treated with GRL-8234 and their memory function remained impaired. We found that not only BACE1 but also full-length APP expression was significantly elevated with progressive Aβ accumulation in 5XFAD mice, while GRL-8234 failed to affect these detrimental mechanisms that further accelerate plaque growth in brains of older 5XFAD mice. Therefore, our results provide important insights into the mechanisms by which Aβ accumulation and related memory impairments become less responsive to rescue by BACE1 inhibition during the course of AD development.

25523424,"Amyloid-beta protein clearance and degradation (ABCD) pathways and their role in Alzheimer's disease.","Amyloid-β proteins (Aβ) of 42 (Aβ42) and 40 aa (Aβ40) accumulate as senile plaques (SP) and cerebrovascular amyloid protein deposits that are defining diagnostic features of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A number of rare mutations linked to familial AD (FAD) on the Aβ precursor protein (APP), Presenilin-1 (PS1), Presenilin- 2 (PS2), Adamalysin10, and other genetic risk factors for sporadic AD such as the ε4 allele of Apolipoprotein E (ApoE-ε4) foster the accumulation of Aβ and also induce the entire spectrum of pathology associated with the disease. Aβ accumulation is therefore a key pathological event and a prime target for the prevention and treatment of AD. APP is sequentially processed by β-site APP cleaving enzyme (BACE1) and γ-secretase, a multisubunit PS1/PS2-containing integral membrane protease, to generate Aβ. Although Aβ accumulates in all forms of AD, the only pathways known to be affected in FAD increase Aβ production by APP gene duplication or via base substitutions on APP and γ-secretase subunits PS1 and PS2 that either specifically increase the yield of the longer Aβ42 or both Aβ40 and Aβ42. However, the vast majority of AD patients accumulate Aβ without these known mutations. This led to proposals that impairment of Aβ degradation or clearance may play a key role in AD pathogenesis. Several candidate enzymes, including Insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE), Neprilysin (NEP), Endothelin-converting enzyme (ECE), Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), Plasmin, and Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been identified and some have even been successfully evaluated in animal models. Several studies also have demonstrated the capacity of γ-secretase inhibitors to paradoxically increase the yield of Aβ and we have recently established that the mechanism is by skirting Aβ degradation. This review outlines major cellular pathways of Aβ degradation to provide a basis for future efforts to fully characterize the panel of pathways responsible for Aβ turnover.

Here we examined if synaptic long-term potentiation is selectively disrupted prior to extracellular deposition of Aß in a very complete model of Alzheimer's disease amyloidosis, the McGill-R-Thy1-APP transgenic rat. Longitudinal studies in freely behaving animals revealed an age-dependent, relatively rapid-onset and persistent inhibition of long-term potentiation without a change in baseline synaptic transmission in the CA1 area of the hippocampus. Thus the ability of a standard 200 Hz conditioning protocol to induce significant NMDA receptor-dependent short- and long-term potentiation was lost at about 3.5 months of age and this deficit persisted for at least another 2-3 months, when plaques start to appear. Consistent with in vitro evidence for a causal role of a selective reduction in NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic currents, the deficit in synaptic plasticity in vivo was associated with a reduction in the synaptic burst response to the conditioning stimulation and was overcome using stronger 400 Hz stimulation. Moreover, intracerebroventricular treatment for 3 days with an N-terminally directed monoclonal anti- human Aß antibody, McSA1, transiently reversed the impairment of synaptic plasticity. Similar brief treatment with the BACE1 inhibitor LY2886721 or the γ-secretase inhibitor MRK-560 was found to have a comparable short-lived ameliorative effect when tracked in individual rats. These findings provide strong evidence that endogenously generated human Aß selectively disrupts the induction of long-term potentiation in a manner that enables potential therapeutic options to be assessed longitudinally at the pre-plaque stage of Alzheimer's disease amyloidosis.","2051-5960","Acta neuropathologica communications","(2) 175",2014,"Yingjie","Qi","Y",""
25557959,"Role of copper and the copper-related protein CUTA in mediating APP processing and Aβ generation.","One major pathologic hallmark and trigger of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is overproduction and accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) species in the brain. Aβ is derived from β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) through sequential cleavages by β- and γ-secretases. Abnormal copper homeostasis also contributes to AD pathogenesis. Recently, we find that a copper-related protein, CutA divalent cation tolerance homolog of Escherichia coli (CUTA), interacts with the β-secretase β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and inhibits APP β-processing and Aβ generation. Herein, we further found that overexpression of CUTA increases intracellular copper level, whereas copper treatments promote CUTA expression. We also confirmed that copper treatments promote APP expression and Aβ secretion. In addition, copper treatments promoted the increase of Aβ secretion induced by CUTA downregulation but had no effect on CUTA-β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 interaction. On the other hand, CUTA overexpression ameliorated copper-induced Aβ secretion but had no effect on APP expression. Moreover, we found that Aβ treatments can reduce both CUTA and copper levels in mouse primary neurons. Consistently, both CUTA and copper levels were decreased in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 AD mouse brain. Together, our results reveal a reciprocal modulation of copper and CUTA and suggest that both regulate Aβ generation through different mechanisms, although Aβ mutually affects copper and CUTA levels.

Endosomes are a major site of production of Aβ peptide from the processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by clipping enzymes (β- and γ-secretases). The β-secretase enzyme BACE1 requires acidic lumen pH for optimum function, and acid pH promotes Aβ aggregation. The Na(+)/H(+) exchanger NHE6 provides a leak pathway for protons, limiting luminal acidification by proton pumps. Like APP, NHE6 expression was induced upon differentiation of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and localized to an endosomal compartment. Therefore, we investigated whether NHE6 expression altered APP localization and processing in a stably transfected cell culture model of human APP expression. We show that co-expression with NHE6 or treatment with the Na(+)/H(+) ionophore monensin shifted APP away from the trans-Golgi network into early and recycling endosomes in HEK293 cells. NHE6 alkalinized the endosomal lumen, similar to monensin, and significantly attenuated APP processing and Aβ secretion. In contrast, Aβ production was elevated upon NHE6 knockdown. We show that NHE6 transcript and protein levels are lowered in Alzheimer brains relative to control. These findings, taken together with emerging genetic evidence linking endosomal Na(+)/H(+) exchangers with Alzheimer disease, suggest that proton leak pathways may regulate Aβ generation and contribute to disease etiology.

In this study, we used a mouse TD model to assess the involvement of PKR in neuronal death and the molecular mechanisms of AD. Our results showed that the TD model activates the PKR-eIF2α pathway, increases the BACE1 expression levels of Aβ in specific thalamus nuclei and induces motor deficits and neurodegeneration.

Analysis of knockout mice lacking the biosynthetic enzyme for bisecting GlcNAc, GnT-III (Mgat3), revealed that cleavage of Aβ-precursor protein (APP) by BACE1 is reduced in these mice, resulting in a decrease in Aβ plaques and improved cognitive function. The lack of this modification directs BACE1 to late endosomes/lysosomes where it is less colocalized with APP, leading to accelerated lysosomal degradation. Notably, other BACE1 substrates, CHL1 and contactin-2, are normally cleaved in GnT-III-deficient mice, suggesting that the effect of bisecting GlcNAc on BACE1 is selective to APP.

To date, no characterization of AD-related genes in different brain regions has been performed. Therefore, in the current study, the expression of seven amyloid precursor protein (APP) pathway-related and five tau phosphorylation-related genes was investigated by quantitative real-time PCR experiments, using two matched-pair brain samples from control and icv STZ-treated cynomolgus monkeys. The genes showed similar expression patterns within the control and icv STZ-treated groups; however, marked differences in gene expression patterns were observed between the control and icv STZ-treated groups. Remarkably, other than β-secretase (BACE1) and cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5), all the genes tested showed similar expression patterns in AD models compared to controls, with increased levels in the precuneus and occipital cortex. However, significant changes in gene expression patterns were not detected in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, or posterior cingulate. Based on these results, we conclude that APP may be cleaved via the general metabolic mechanisms of increased α- and γ-secretase levels, and that hyperphosphorylation of tau could be mediated by elevated levels of tau protein kinase, specifically in the precuneus and occipital cortex.

To serve as a frame of reference, the ELISA and Western analyses were performed in parallel on samples from neuropathologically confirmed non-demented control (NDC) and AD subjects who did not receive semagacestat. Neuropathology findings confirmed a diagnosis of AD with frequent amyloid deposits and neurofibrillary tangles in most areas of the cortex and subcortical nuclei as well as cerebellar amyloid plaques. Mean levels of Tris-soluble Aβ40 and glass-distilled formic acid (GDFA)/guanidine hydrochloride (GHCl)-extractable Aβ40 in the frontal lobe and GDFA/GHCl-soluble Aβ40 in the temporal lobe were increased 4.2, 9.5 and 7.7-fold, respectively, in the semagacestat-treated subject compared to those observed in the non-treated AD group. In addition, GDFA/GHCl-extracted Aβ42 was increased 2-fold in the temporal lobe relative to non-treated AD cases. No major changes in APP, β- and γ-secretase and CT99/CT83 were observed between the semagacestat-treated subject compared to either NDC or AD cases. Furthermore, the levels of γ-secretase substrates in the semagacestat-treated subject and the reference groups were also similar. Interestingly, there were significant alterations in the levels of several γ-secretase substrates between the NDC and non-treated AD subjects. This is the first reported case study of an individual enrolled in the semagacestat clinical trial. The subject of this study remained alive for ~7 months after treatment termination, therefore it is difficult to conclude whether the outcomes observed represent a consequence of semagacestat therapy. Additional evaluations of trial participants, including several who expired during the course of treatment, may provide vital clarification regarding the impacts and aftermath of γ-secretase inhibition.

Aβ is generated from amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) through sequential cleavages first by β-secretase and then by γ-secretase. Inhibiting β-secretase activity is believed to be one of the most promising strategies for AD treatment. In the present study, we found that a resveratrol trimer, miyabenol C, isolated from stems and leaves of the small-leaf grape (Vitisthunbergii var. taiwaniana), can markedly reduce Aβ and sAPPβ levels in both cell cultures and the brain of AD model mice. Mechanistic studies revealed that miyabenol C affects neither protein levels of APP, the two major α-secretases ADAM10 and TACE, and the γ-secretase component Presenilin 1, nor γ-secretase-mediated Notch processing and TACE activity. In contrast, although miyabenol C has no effect on altering protein levels of the β-secretase BACE1, it can inhibit both in vitro and in vivo β-secretase activity. Together, our results indicate that miyabenol C is a prominent β-secretase inhibitor and lead compound for AD drug development.

25663301,"Transcriptional regulation of BACE1 by NFAT3 leads to enhanced amyloidogenic processing.","Deposition of amyloid β (Aβ) to form neuritic plaques in the brain is the pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aβ is generated from sequential cleavages of the β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the β- and γ-secretases, and β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is the essential β-secretase for Aβ generation. Vulnerable regions in AD brains show increased BACE1 protein levels. However, the underlying mechanism how BACE1 is regulated remains to be further illustrated. Nuclear Factor of Activated T-cells (NFAT) has been implicated in AD pathogenesis. Despite the increasing appreciation for the importance of NFAT-dependent transcription in the nervous system, the regulation and function of specific NFAT isoforms in neurons is poorly understood. In this report we found that both BACE1 and NFAT3 levels were significantly increased in the brains of APP/PS1 transgenic mice. We found that overexpression of NFAT3 resulted in increase of BACE1 promoter activity and BACE1 transcription, while disruption of NFAT3 expression decreased BACE1 gene transcription and protein expression in SAS1 cells. In a addition, overexpression of NFAT3 leads to increase levels of Aβ production. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed direct binding of NFAT3 to specific DNA sequences within BACE1 promoter region. Taken together, our results indicate that NFAT is a BACE1 transcription factor. Our study suggests that inhibition of NFAT-mediated BACE1 expression may be a valuable drug target for AD therapy.","1573-6903","Neurochemical research","(40) 829-36",2015,"Zhengrong","Mei","Z","The Third Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, 510150, Guangdong Province, People's Republic of China."

The structure of this natural compound was elucidated based on its spectral data, and it was identified as pratensein. The protective effect of pratensein was evaluated using a cognitive impairment model induced by injecting amyloid beta (1-42) (Aβ1-42) into the bilateral hippocampus of rats. The results showed that pratensein treatment significantly protected against Aβ1-42-induced cognitive impairments, as evidenced by the improvement in learning and memory and the attenuation of neuronal degeneration and apoptosis in hippocampus. Analysis of the potential mechanisms of action showed that pratensein significantly decreased inflammatory indicators such as MDA, NO, nNOS, IL-1β and TNF-α. Pratensein markedly decreased the content and deposition of β-amyloid peptide through regulating the expressions of Aβ-related genes including APP, BACE1, CatB, NEP and IDE. Moreover, pratensein significantly increased the expressions of synapse plasticity-related proteins, i.e., PSD-95, p-NMDAR1, p-CaMKII, p-PKACβ, PKCγ, p-CREB and BDNF. In addition, pratensein significantly decreased the activity of cholinesterase, then subsequently elevated the level of acetylcholine. In summary, our study indicated that pratensein may have a likely protective effect against Alzheimer's disease (AD) via improving synaptic plasticity and increasing cholinesterase activity.

Additionally, quercetin induced improved performance on learning and spatial memory tasks and greater risk assessment behavior based on the elevated plus maze test.

Previous works have suggested that systemic inflammation could contribute to neuroinflammation and enhanced Aβ cerebral concentrations. The molecular pathways leading to these events are not fully understood. PKR is a pro-apoptotic kinase that can trigger inflammation and accumulates in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid of AD patients. The goal of the present study was to assess if LPS-induced neuroinflammation and Aβ production could be altered by genetic PKR down regulation. The results show that, in the hippocampus of LPS-injected wild type mice, neuroinflammation, cytokine release and Aβ production are significantly increased and not in LPS-treated PKR knock-out mice. In addition BACE1 and activated STAT3 levels, a putative transcriptional regulator of BACE1, were not found increased in the brain of PKR knock-out mice as observed in wild type mice. Using PET imaging, the decrease of hippocampal metabolism induced by systemic LPS was not observed in LPS-treated PKR knock-out mice. Altogether, these findings demonstrate that PKR plays a major role in brain changes induced by LPS and could be a valid target to modulate neuroinflammation and Aβ production.

25691377,"Paradigm shift redefining molecular, metabolic and structural events in Alzheimer's disease involves a proposed contribution by transition metals. Defined lengthy preclinical stage provides new hope to circumvent advancement of disease- and age-related neurodegeneration.","It is estimated that 5.5 Million North Americans suffer from varying degrees of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and by the year 2050 it may be one in 85 people globally (100 Million). It will be shown that heavy metal toxicity plays a significant role in sporadic AD. Although current literature speaks to involvement of metal ions (via Fenton reaction), studies and reviewers have yet to link cellular events including known structural changes such as amyloid plaque development to this metal toxicity the way it is proposed here. Contrary to the current AD model which positions BACE1 (β-secretase) as an aberrant or AD-advancing enzyme, it is proposed herein that the neuron's protective counteraction to this metal toxicity is, in fact, a justified increase in BACE1 activity and amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing to yield more secreted APP (sAPP) and β-amyloid peptide in response to metal toxicity. This new perspective which justifies a functional role for APP, BACE1 enzyme activity and the peptide products from this activity may at first appear to be counterintuitive. Compelling evidence, however, is presented and a mechanism is shown herein that validate BACE1 recruitment and the resulting β-amyloid protein as strategic countermeasures serving the cell effectively against neuro-impeding disease. It is proposed that β-amyloid peptide chelates and sequesters free heavy metals in the extracellular medium to aggregate as amyloid plaque while unchelated β-amyloid migrates across the cell membrane to chelate intracellular free divalent metals. The sequestered intracellular metal is subsequently chaperoned as a metallo-peptide to cross the plasma membrane and aggregate as amyloid plaques extracellularly. The BACE1 countermeasure is not genetic or metabolic aberration; and this novel conclusion demonstrates that it must not be inhibited as currently targeted. APP, BACE1, β-amyloid peptide, and sAPP play positive roles against the preclinical oxidative load that predates AD symptoms for as long as 20 years. A healthy neuron may tolerate free metal toxicity, such as iron in the case of injury-induced amyloid, for as long as twenty years due to this very BACE1 activity. In later stages, the uncontrolled metals and ROS are compounded by other factors which together overcome this BACE1/β-amyloid protein countermeasure. This results in a sudden increase in IL-1 leading to Tau's hyperphosphorylation as cited and eventually to Tau dissociation from the microtubule cytoskeleton interrupting cell trafficking. At this later stage of AD the β-amyloid protein which once served as a vehicle to escort toxic metals to the extracellular medium and a trap to form a relatively benign extraneuronal disposal site is no longer translocated due to interruption of trafficking and now accumulates intracellularly facilitating hyper-oxidative ROS levels and contributes to irreversible neuron apoptosis.","1532-2777","Medical hypotheses","(84) 460-9",2015,"Franco","Cavaleri","F","Brain Research Center, UBC Hospital, 2211 Wesbrook Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 2B5, Canada.

Active site of BACE1 contains catalytic aspartic (Asp) dyad and flap. Asp dyad cleaves the substrate amyloid precursor protein with the help of flap. Currently, there are no marketed drugs available against BACE1 and existing inhibitors are mostly pseudopeptide or synthetic derivatives. There is a need to search for a potent inhibitor with natural scaffold interacting with flap and Asp dyad. This study screens the natural database InterBioScreen, followed by three-dimensional (3D) QSAR pharmacophore modeling, mapping, in silico ADME/T predictions to find the potential BACE1 inhibitors. Further, molecular dynamics of selected inhibitors were performed to observe the dynamic structure of protein after ligand binding. All conformations and the residues of binding region were stable but the flap adopted a closed conformation after binding with the ligand. Bond oligosaccharide interacted with the flap as well as catalytic dyad via hydrogen bond throughout the simulation. This led to stabilize the flap in closed conformation and restricted the entry of substrate. Carbohydrates have been earlier used in the treatment of AD because of their low toxicity, high efficiency, good biocompatibility, and easy permeability through the blood-brain barrier.

Unlike genetic studies, potential environmental factors affecting AD pathogenesis have not yet been thoroughly investigated. Among environmental factors, pesticides seem to be one of critical environmental contributors to late-onset AD. Recent studies reported that the serum and brains of AD patients have dramatically higher levels of a metabolite of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT). While these epidemiological studies provided initial clues to the environmental risks potentially contributing to disease pathogenesis, a functional approach is required to determine whether they actually have a causal role in disease development. In our study, we addressed this critical knowledge gap by investigating possible mechanisms by which DDT affects amyloid-β (Aβ) levels. We treated H4-AβPPswe or H4 cells with DDT to analyze its effect on Aβ metabolism using Aβ production, clearance, and degradation assays. We found that DDT significantly increased the levels of amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP) and β-site AβPP-cleaving enzyme1 (BACE1), affecting Aβ synthesis pathway in H4-AβPPswe cells. Additionally, DDT impaired the clearance and extracellular degradation of Aβ peptides. Most importantly, we identified for the first time that ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) and insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) are the downstream target genes adversely affected by DDT. Our findings provide insight into the molecular mechanisms by which DDT exposure may increase the risk of AD, and it further supports that ABCA1 and IDE may be potential therapeutic targets.","1875-8908","Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD","(46) 109-22",2015,"Gongbo","Li","G","Department of Neurology, Daping Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing, China."

Knowledge regarding the other cellular functions of BACE1 is therefore critical for the safe use of BACE1 inhibitors in human patients. BACE1 deficiency in mice causes hypomyelination during development and impairs remyelination in injured sciatic nerves. Since BACE1 is expected to be ubiquitously expressed, we asked whether axonal or Schwann cell BACE1 is required for optimal remyelination. By swapping sciatic nerve segments from BACE1-null mice with the corresponding wild-type nerve segments or vice versa, we tested how a deficiency of BACE1 in Schwann cells or axons affects remyelination.

25773675,"CHIP stabilizes amyloid precursor protein via proteasomal degradation and p53-mediated trans-repression of β-secretase.","In patient with Alzheimer's disease (AD), deposition of amyloid-beta Aβ, a proteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β-secretase/BACE1, forms senile plaque in the brain. BACE1 activation is caused due to oxidative stresses and dysfunction of ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), which is linked to p53 inactivation. As partial suppression of BACE1 attenuates Aβ generation and AD-related pathology, it might be an ideal target for AD treatment. We have shown that both in neurons and in HEK-APP cells, BACE1 is a new substrate of E3-ligase CHIP and an inverse relation exists between CHIP and BACE1 level. CHIP inhibits ectopic BACE1 level by promoting its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, thus reducing APP processing; it stabilizes APP in neurons, thus reducing Aβ. CHIP(U) (box) domain physically interacts with BACE1; however, both U-box and TPR domain are essential for ubiquitination and degradation of BACE1. Further, BACE1 is a downstream target of p53 and overexpression of p53 decreases BACE1 level. In HEK-APP cells, CHIP is shown to negatively regulate BACE1 promoter through stabilization of p53's DNA-binding conformation and its binding upon 5' UTR element (+127 to +150). We have thus discovered that CHIP regulates p53-mediated trans-repression of BACE1 at both transcriptional and post-translational level. We propose that a CHIP-BACE1-p53 feedback loop might control APP stabilization, which could further be utilized for new therapeutic intervention in AD.","1474-9726","Aging cell","(14) 595-604",2015,"Amir Kumar","Singh","AK","School of Biotechnology, Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, 110067, India."

The inhibition of β-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), a key enzyme for Aβ production, is a promising target for AD therapy. In pursuit to find a potent inhibitor of BACE1, we identified galangin, a natural flavonoid, had a significant lowering effect on Aβ levels. Furthermore, a dramatic reduction of BACE1 at mRNA and protein levels was observed after galangin treatment. We further investigated whether epigenetic mechanisms, such as histone acetylation and DNA methylation, were involved in galangin-induced transcriptional regulation of BACE1. Our data show that galangin induces a decrease of acetylated H3 in the BACE1 promoter regions through the up-regulation of endogenous HDAC1-mediated deacetylation, which is independent of DNA methylation status. The above findings suggest a novel mechanism for polyphenols' neuroprotective effect in neurodegeneration and galangin as a potential drug candidate for AD therapy.","1873-7544","Neuroscience","(294) 172-81",2015,"H","Zeng","H","College of Life Sciences, Wuhan University, Wuhan, Hubei 430072, China."

Chronic LTG treatment rescues the suppressed long-term potentiation, loss of spines and cognitive deficits in AβPP/PS1 mice, known to overexpress a chimeric mouse/human mutant amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP) and a mutant human presenilin 1 (PS1). These changes are accompanied by reduction of amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques density and of levels of β-C-terminal fragment of AβPP (β-CTF), a fragment of AβPP cleaved by β-secretase. These results suggest LTG treatment reduces Aβ production, possibly through modulation of cleavage of AβPP by β-secretase. However, the underlying mechanisms still remain unclear. In this study, decreased protein levels, but not mRNA levels of β-site AβPP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), were observed in cultured HEK293 cells and the brains of AβPP/PS1 transgenic mice upon LTG treatment. Moreover, LTG treatment suppressed mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling, while enhancing activation of cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), two signaling pathways essential for autophagy induction. LTG treatment increased the numbers of LC3-GFP + puncta and LC3-II levels in HEK293 cells, indicating an induction of autophagy. The downregulation of BACE1 by LTG treatment was prevented by the autophagy inhibitor 3-Methyladenine. Therefore, this study shows that LTG treatment reduces the protein levels of BACE1 through activation of autophagy, possibly via inhibition of mTOR signaling and activation of CREB.

Essential dynamics reveal that concerted movements in several loops including the flap region lead to a conformational switching from open to closed form. During the simulation, free BACE1 visits both the open and closed forms multiple times.

It has been shown that high-cholesterol contents in the blood and brain may lead to the deposition of the β-amyloid (Aβ) protein in the brain, which damages brain cells. The present study was designed to observe the effect of polyphenol-rich Oriental plums on cognitive function and cerebral neurodegeneration-related protein expression in mice that were fed a high-cholesterol diet for 5 months. The study consisted of four groups: the control (Ctrl) group, which was fed the American Institute of Nutrition (AIN)-93M diet; the high cholesterol (HC) group, which was fed the AIN-93M diet with 5% cholesterol; the high cholesterol + low Oriental plum (LOP) group, which was fed the AIN-93M diet with 5% cholesterol and 2% Oriental plum powder; and the high cholesterol + high Oriental plum (HOP) group, which was fed the AIN-93M diet with 5% cholesterol and 5% Oriental plum powder. Measurements of cognitive function were assessed using the Morris water maze, and the mRNA expression of cholesterol hydroxylase (Cyp46), Aβ and β-secretase 1 (BACE1) were analysed. The results showed that cholesterol concentrations in both the blood and the brain were significantly higher in the HC group than in the Ctrl and HOP groups at the end of the trial. The high-cholesterol diet per se produced significant cognitive deficits, which were accompanied by a significantly increased mRNA expression of Cyp46, BACE1, Aβ and 24-hydroxycholesterol in the brain cortex and hippocampus. However, all of these variables were non-significantly increased in the HOP group as compared to the Ctrl group.

25906170,"Enhanced ligand sampling for relative protein-ligand binding free energy calculations.","Free energy calculations are used to study how strongly potential drug molecules interact with their target receptors. The accuracy of these calculations depends on the accuracy of the molecular dynamics (MD) force field as well as proper sampling of the major conformations of each molecule. However, proper sampling of ligand conformations can be difficult when there are large barriers separating the major ligand conformations. An example of this is for ligands with an asymmetrically substituted phenyl ring, where the presence of protein loops hinders the proper sampling of the different ring conformations. These ring conformations become more difficult to sample when the size of the functional groups attached to the ring increases. The Adaptive Integration Method (AIM) has been developed, which adaptively changes the alchemical coupling parameter λ during the MD simulation so that conformations sampled at one λ can aid sampling at the other λ values. The Accelerated Adaptive Integration Method (AcclAIM) builds on AIM by lowering potential barriers for specific degrees of freedom at intermediate λ values. However, these methods may not work when there are very large barriers separating the major ligand conformations. In this work, we describe a modification to AIM that improves sampling of the different ring conformations, even when there is a very large barrier between them. This method combines AIM with conformational Monte Carlo sampling, giving improved convergence of ring populations and the resulting free energy. This method, called AIM/MC, is applied to study the relative binding free energy for a pair of ligands that bind to thrombin and a different pair of ligands that bind to aspartyl protease β-APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1). These protein-ligand binding free energy calculations illustrate the improvements in conformational sampling and the convergence of the free energy compared to both AIM and AcclAIM.

Using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to measure DA and DA metabolites in the striatum, we found no significant differences in BACE1(-/-) compared with wild-type mice. To determine if DA neuron excitability is altered in BACE1(-/-) mice, we performed patch-clamp electrophysiology in putative DA neurons from brain slices that contained the substantia nigra. Pacemaker firing rate was slightly increased in slices from BACE1(-/-) mice. We next measured G protein-coupled potassium currents produced by activation of D2 autoreceptors, which strongly inhibit firing of these neurons. The maximal amplitude and decay times of D2 autoreceptor currents were not altered in BACE1(-/-) mice, indicating no change in D2 autoreceptor-sensitivity and DA transporter-mediated reuptake. However, amphetamine (30 µm)-induced potassium currents produced by efflux of DA were enhanced in BACE1(-/-) mice, perhaps indicating increased vesicular DA content in the midbrain. This suggests a plausible mechanism to explain the decreased sensitivity to amphetamine-induced locomotion, and provides evidence that decreased availability of BACE1 can produce persistent adaptations in the dopaminergic system.

Prior work has illustrated robust lowering of central amyloid β (Aβ) after acute administration of BACE1 inhibitors.

We investigated the effects of a potent nonbrain-penetrant BACE1 inhibitor, delivered directly to the brain using intracerebroventricular infusion in an aged transgenic mouse model. Intracerebroventricular infusion of the BACE1 inhibitor (0.3-23.5 μg/d) for 8 weeks, initiated in 17-month-old Tg2576 mice, produced dose-dependent increases in brain inhibitor concentrations (0.2-13 μm). BACE1 inhibition significantly reversed the behavioral deficit in contextual fear conditioning, and reduced brain Aβ levels, plaque burden, and associated pathology (e.g., dystrophic neurites), with maximal effects attained with ∼1 μg/d dose. Strikingly, the BACE1 inhibitor also reversed amyloid pathology below baseline levels (amyloid burden at the start of treatment), without adversely affecting cerebral amyloid angiopathy, microhemorrhages, myelination, or neuromuscular function. Inhibitor-mediated decline in brain amyloid pathology was associated with an increase in microglial ramification. This is the first demonstration of chronically administered BACE1 inhibitor to activate microglia, reverse brain amyloid pathology, and elicit functional improvement in an aged transgenic mouse model. Thus, engagement of novel glial-mediated clearance mechanisms may drive disease-modifying therapeutic benefit with BACE1 inhibition in AD.","1529-2401","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","(35) 6931-6",2015,"Deepak R","Thakker","DR","Neuromodulation Global Research, Technology & Development."

25941885,"Preventing the spread of Alzheimer's disease neuropathology: a role for calcilytics?","The ""amyloid cascade hypothesis"" posits that an extracellular build-up of amyloid-β oligomers (Aβ-os) and polymers (fibrils) subsequently inducing toxic hyperphosphorylated (p)-Tau oligomers (p-Tau-os) and neurofibrillary tangles starts the sporadic late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) in the aged lateral entorhinal cortex. Conversely, mutated genes cause a diffuse cerebral Aβs/Aβ-os overproduction promoting early-onset familiar AD (EOFAD). Surplus exogenous Aβ-os exert toxic actions at several levels. They reach the nuclei of human astrocyte-neurons teams (ANTs) to enhance the transcription of Aβ precursor protein (APP) and β-secretase/BACE1 genes. The overexpressed APP and BACE1 proteins act in concert with γ-secretase to overproduce endogenous Aβs/Aβ-os, of which a few enter the nuclei to upkeep Aβs overproduction, while the rest gather in the cytoplasm, damage mitochondria, and are oversecreted. Simultaneously, extracellular Aβ-os bind the ANTs' calcium-sensing receptors (CaSRs) activating signalings that hinder the proteolysis and hence favor the surplus hoarding/secretion of Aβs/Aβ-os. Overreleased Aβ-os spread, reach growing numbers of adjacent ANTs to recruit them to overproduce/oversecrete further Aβ-os amounts via the just mentioned mechanisms. Alongside, Aβ•CaSR signalings elicit a noxious overproduction/overrelease of nitric oxide (NO) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A from ANTs' astrocytes. While astrocytes survive the toxic onslaught, neurons die. Thus, AD progression is driven by ceaselessly self-sustaining neurotoxic cycles, which engender first Aβ-os and later p-Tau-os that cooperatively destroy increasingly wider cognition-related cortical areas. Notably, a highly selective allosteric CaSR antagonist (calcilytic), like NPS 2143, does preserve human cortical postnatal HCN-1A neurons viability notwithstanding the presence of exogenous Aβ-os by suppressing the otherwise elicited oversecretion and spread of newly synthesized Aβ-os. Therefore, if given at minimal cognitive impairment or earlier stages, calcilytics could halt AD progression and preserve the patients' cortical neurons, cognitive abilities, and eventually life.

Emerging evidence suggests that ectopic expression of micro (mi)RNAs is involved in the pathogenesis of AD. There is increasing evidence that miRNAs expressed in the brain are involved in neuronal development, survival and apoptosis. The expression of β-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is regulated by dysregulated miRNAs in the brain. The present study determined the expression levels of the miRNA-29 (miR-29) family in peripheral blood samples of patients with AD and demonstrated a marked decrease in the expression of miR-29c compared with age-matched controls. In addition, a significant increase in the expression of BACE1 was observed in the peripheral blood of patients with AD. Correlation analysis revealed that the expression of miR-29c was negatively correlated with the protein expression of BACE1 in the peripheral blood samples from patients with AD. The present study also investigated the role of miR-29 on hippocampal neurons in vitro and in vivo. The results demonstrated that the upregulation of miR-29c promoted learning and memory behaviors in SAMP8 mice, at least partially, by increasing the activity of protein kinase A/cAMP response element-binding protein, involved in neuroprotection. This evidence suggested that miR-29c may be a promising potential therapeutic target against AD.","1791-3004","Molecular medicine reports","(12) 3081-8",2015,"Guoshuai","Yang","G","Department of Neurology, Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510515, P.R.

Using LPEI-siRNA nanoparticles against either BACE1 or APP in cultured mouse neuroblastoma (N2a) cells, we observe selective knockdown, respectively, of BACE1 or APP. The encapsulation of siRNA by LPEI-g-PEG carriers, with different grafting degrees of PEG, leads to the formation of micellar nanoparticles with distinct morphologies, including worm-like, rod-like, or spherical nanoparticles. By infusing these shaped nanoparticles into mouse lateral ventricles, we show that rod-shaped nanoparticles achieved the most efficient knockdown of BACE1 in the brain. Furthermore, such knockdown is evident in spinal cords of these treated mice.

The impact of Radix Polygalae in patients with Alzheimer's disease has been investigated. However the mechanisms underlying its effects remain unclear. In the current study, the toxicity of various doses (100, 40, 20, 10, 5 and 0 μg/ml) of Radix Polygalae was measured in the human neuroblastoma cell line (SH-SY5Y) using an MTT assay. Changes in amyloid β (Aβ) levels in the supernatant of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells overexpressing β-amyloid pro-protein (APP) and BACE1 (CHO-APP/BACE1), were detected using an ELISA assay. In order to confirm that the Aβ reduction was associated with autophagy, the autophagy marker protein, light chain 3 (LC3), was measured by western blot analysis and autophagosomes were assessed using MDC staining. In addition, the mechanism underlying the autophagy induced by Radix Polygalae was analyzed using western blotting to measure the protein expression of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), p70s6k, Raptor, protein kinase B and adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), in addition to the phosphorylated forms of these proteins. The results demonstrated no significant toxicity of Radix Polygalae in SH-SY5Y cells, at a dose of 100 μg/ml. The secretion of Aβ was markedly reduced following treatment with Radix Polygalae, and this reduction occurred in a dose-dependent manner. The autophagy levels were shown to be enhanced in the drug treatment group, using fluorescence microscopy. In addition, levels of LC3II/LC3I, the marker protein of autophagy, were also increased. The results of the current study suggest that Radix Polygalae may aid in the elimination of the Aβ peptide, via the induction of autophagy, by the AMPK/mTOR signaling pathway.

We applied OpenArray technology to profile the expression of 1178 unique miRNAs in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples of AD patients (n = 22) and controls (n = 28). Using a Cq of 34 as cut-off, we identified positive signals for 441 miRNAs, while 729 miRNAs could not be detected, indicating that at least 37% of miRNAs are present in the brain. We found 74 miRNAs being down- and 74 miRNAs being up-regulated in AD using a 1.5 fold change threshold. By applying the new explorative ""Measure of relevance"" method, 6 reliable and 9 informative biomarkers were identified. Confirmatory MANCOVA revealed reliable miR-100, miR-146a and miR-1274a as differentially expressed in AD reaching Bonferroni corrected significance.

The transgenic (Tg)-5xFAD and wild type (WT) mice were chronically exposed to RF-EMF for 8 months (1950 MHz, SAR 5W/kg, 2 hrs/day, 5 days/week). Notably, chronic RFEMF exposure significantly reduced not only Aβ plaques, APP, and APP carboxyl-terminal fragments (CTFs) in whole brain including hippocampus and entorhinal cortex but also the ratio of Aβ42 and Aβ40 peptide in the hippocampus of Tg-5xFAD mice. We also found that parenchymal expression of β-amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1(BACE1) and neuroinflammation were inhibited by RF-EMF exposure in Tg-5xFAD. In addition, RF-EMF was shown to rescue memory impairment in Tg-5xFAD. Moreover, gene profiling from microarray data using hippocampus of WT and Tg- 5xFAD following RF-EMF exposure revealed that 5 genes (Tshz2, Gm12695, St3gal1, Isx and Tll1), which are involved in Aβ, are significantly altered inTg-5xFAD mice, exhibiting different responses to RF-EMF in WT or Tg-5xFAD mice; RF-EMF exposure in WT mice showed similar patterns to control Tg-5xFAD mice, however, RF-EMF exposure in Tg- 5xFAD mice showed opposite expression patterns. These findings indicate that chronic RF-EMF exposure directly affects Aβ pathology in AD but not in normal brain. Therefore, RF-EMF has preventive effects against AD-like pathology in advanced AD mice with a high expression of Aβ, which suggests that RF-EMF can have a beneficial influence on AD.

Recently, GGA1 and GGA3 were shown to interact with BACE1, to be expressed in neurons, and to be decreased in AD brain, whereas little is known about GGA2. Since GGA1 impacts Aβ generation by confining APP to the Golgi and perinuclear compartments, we tested whether all GGAs modulate BACE1 and APP transport and processing. We observed decreased levels of secreted APP alpha (sAPPα), sAPPβ, and Aβ upon GGA overexpression, which could be reverted by knockdown. GGA-BACE1 co-immunoprecipitation was impaired upon GGA-GAE but not VHS domain deletion. Autoinhibition of the GGA1-VHS domain was irrelevant for BACE1 interaction.

Recent reports suggest a potential role of DISC1 in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), by referring to an interaction between DISC1 and amyloid precursor protein (APP), and to an association of a single-nucleotide polymorphism in a DISC1 intron and late onset of AD. However, the function of DISC1 in AD remains unknown. In this study, decreased levels of DISC1 were observed in the cortex and hippocampus of 8-month-old APP/PS1 transgenic mice, an animal model of AD. Overexpression of DISC1 reduced, whereas knockdown of DISC1 increased protein levels, but not mRNA levels of β-site APP-Cleaving Enzyme 1 (BACE1), a key enzyme in amyloid-β (Aβ) generation. Reduction of BACE1 protein levels by overexpression of DISC1 was accompanied by an accelerating decline rate of BACE1, and was blocked by the lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine, rather than proteasome inhibitor MG-132. Moreover, overexpression of DISC1 in the hippocampus with an adeno-associated virus reduced the levels of BACE1, soluble Aβ40/42, amyloid plaque density, and rescued cognitive deficits of APP/PS1 transgenic mice. These results indicate that DISC1 attenuates Aβ generation and cognitive deficits of APP/PS1 transgenic mice through promoting lysosomal degradation of BACE1. Our findings provide new insights into the role of DISC1 in AD pathogenesis and link a potential function of DISC1 to the psychiatric symptoms of AD.

26118667,"Activation of Cdk5/p25 and tau phosphorylation following chronic brain hypoperfusion in rats involves microRNA-195 down-regulation.","Chronic brain hypoperfusion (CBH) is a common clinical feature of Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia, but the underlying molecular mechanism is unclear. Our previous study reported that the down-regulation of microRNA-195 (miR-195) promotes amyloidogenesis via regulation of amyloid precursor protein and β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) expression at the post-transcriptional level in CBH rats with bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (2VO). CBH owing to unilateral common carotid artery occlusion (UCCAO) increases tau phosphorylation levels at multiple phosphorylation sites in the brain, but the molecular mechanism is poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether miR-195 could both deregulate amyloid metabolism and indirectly deregulate tau phosphorylation in CBH. We observed that 2VO leads to tau hyperphosphorylation at Ser202/Thr205, Ser262, Thr231, and Ser422 and to the conversion from cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5)/p35 to Cdk5/p25 in rat hippocampi. Endogenous miR-195 was knocked down using over-expression of its antisense molecule (pre-AMO-miR-195) via a lentivirus (lenti-pre-AMO-miR-195); this knockdown increased the tau phosphorylation at Ser202/Thr205, Ser262, Thr231, Ser422, and the Cdk5/p25 activation, but over-expression of miR-195 using lenti-pre-miR-195 decreased the tau phosphorylation and Cdk5/p25 activation. Further in vitro studies demonstrated that miR-195 over-expression prevented tau hyperphosphorylation and Cdk5/p35 activity, which were increased by miR-195 inhibition. A dual luciferase reporter assay showed that miR-195 bound to the Cdk5r1 gene, which encodes p35 protein, in the 3'UTR and inhibited p35 expression. We concluded that tau hyperphosphorylation involves the down-regulation of miR-195, which is mediated by Cdk5/p25 activation in 2VO rats. Our findings demonstrated that down-regulation of miR-195 led to increased vulnerability via the regulation of multiple targets. Schematic diagram of miR-195 mediated Aβ aggregation and tau hyperphosphorylation in chronic brain hypoperfusion (CBH). First, CBH results in the elevation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), which binds with the promoter sequences of miR-195 and negatively regulates the expression of miR-195. Second, down-regulated miR-195 induces up-regulation of APP and BACE1 and leads to an increase in Aβ levels. Third, some of the elevated Aβ then enter the intracellular space and activate calpain, which promotes the conversion of Cdk5/p35 to Cdk5/p25 and catalyzes the degradation of IκB; IκB is an inhibitor of NF-κB, which activates NF-κB. Cdk5/p25 directly phosphorylates Tau. Fourth, down-regulated miR-195 induces an up-regulation of p35, which provides the active substrates of p25. Our findings demonstrated that the down-regulation of miR-195 plays a key role in the increased vulnerability to dementia via the regulation of multiple targets following CBH.

26123100,"Melatonin regulates the transcription of βAPP-cleaving secretases mediated through melatonin receptors in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells.","Melatonin is involved in the control of various physiological functions, such as sleep, cell growth and free radical scavenging. The ability of melatonin to behave as an antioxidant, together with the fact that the Alzheimer-related amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) triggers oxidative stress through hydroxyl radical-induced cell death, suggests that melatonin could reduce Alzheimer's pathology. Although the exact etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains to be established, excess Aβ is believed to be the primary contributor to the dysfunction and degeneration of neurons that occurs in AD. Aβ peptides are produced via the sequential cleavage of β-secretase β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and γ-secretase (PS1/PS2), while α-secretase (ADAM10) prevents the production of Aβ peptides. We hypothesized that melatonin could inhibit BACE1 and PS1/PS2 and enhance ADAM10 expression. Using the human neuronal SH-SY5Y cell line, we found that melatonin inhibited BACE1 and PS1 and activated ADAM10 mRNA level and protein expression in a concentration-dependent manner and mediated via melatonin G protein-coupled receptors. Melatonin inhibits BACE1 and PS1 protein expressions through the attenuation of nuclear factor-κB phosphorylation (pNF-κB). Moreover, melatonin reduced BACE1 promoter transactivation and consequently downregulated β-secretase catalytic activity. The present data show that melatonin is not only a potential regulator of β/γ-secretase but also an activator of α-secretase expression through the activation of protein kinase C, thereby favoring the nonamyloidogenic pathway over the amyloidogenic pathway. Altogether, our findings suggest that melatonin may be a potential therapeutic agent for reducing the risk of AD in humans.

26124111,"Massive accumulation of luminal protease-deficient axonal lysosomes at Alzheimer's disease amyloid plaques.","Through a comprehensive analysis of organellar markers in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease, we document a massive accumulation of lysosome-like organelles at amyloid plaques and establish that the majority of these organelles reside within swollen axons that contact the amyloid deposits. This close spatial relationship between axonal lysosome accumulation and extracellular amyloid aggregates was observed from the earliest stages of β-amyloid deposition. Notably, we discovered that lysosomes that accumulate in such axons are lacking in multiple soluble luminal proteases and thus are predicted to be unable to efficiently degrade proteinaceous cargos. Of relevance to Alzheimer's disease, β-secretase (BACE1), the protein that initiates amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid precursor protein and which is a substrate for these proteases, builds up at these sites. Furthermore, through a comparison between the axonal lysosome accumulations at amyloid plaques and neuronal lysosomes of the wild-type brain, we identified a similar, naturally occurring population of lysosome-like organelles in neuronal processes that is also defined by its low luminal protease content. In conjunction with emerging evidence that the lysosomal maturation of endosomes and autophagosomes is coupled to their retrograde transport, our results suggest that extracellular β-amyloid deposits cause a local impairment in the retrograde axonal transport of lysosome precursors, leading to their accumulation and a blockade in their further maturation. This study both advances understanding of Alzheimer's disease brain pathology and provides new insights into the subcellular organization of neuronal lysosomes that may have broader relevance to other neurodegenerative diseases with a lysosomal component to their pathology.

26126792,"Significance of transcytosis in Alzheimer's disease: BACE1 takes the scenic route to axons.","Neurons have developed elaborate mechanisms for sorting of proteins to their destination in dendrites and axons as well as dynamic local trafficking. Recent evidence suggests that polarized axonal sorting of β-site converting enzyme 1 (BACE1), a type I transmembrane aspartyl protease involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis, entails an unusual journey. In hippocampal neurons, BACE1 internalized from dendrites is conveyed in recycling endosomes via unidirectional retrograde transport towards the soma and sorted to axons where BACE1 becomes enriched. In comparison to other transmembrane proteins that undergo transcytosis or elimination in somatodendritic compartment, vectorial transport of internalized BACE1 in dendrites is unique and intriguing. Dysfunction of protein transport contributes to pathogenesis of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, characterization of BACE1 transcytosis is an important addition to the multiple lines of evidence that highlight the crucial role played by endosomal trafficking pathway as well as axonal sorting mechanisms in AD pathogenesis.

A total of 36 male Sprague-Dawley rats, aged 2 months, were randomly divided into three groups. These were an insulin-resistant (experimental) group, a high fat control group and a blank control group. The cognitive function and behavioral changes of the rats were tested by a Morris water maze experiment. Amyloid β (Aβ) deposition was detected by an immunohistochemical method. The expression levels of BACE1 in the rat hippocampal tissues were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, western blotting and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction technology. The rats in the experimental group had evident learning and memory impairment, with significantly decreased learning memory. The modeling was successful; in the experimental group, the rats exhibited IR and their glucose metabolism was significantly abnormal. However, there was no characteristic pathology of AD. The expression of BACE1 in the brain tissue of rats in the experimental group was significantly higher than that in high fat control and blank control groups (P<0.01). In conclusion, the expression of BACE1 in the brain tissue of insulin-resistant rats increased, and IR was indicated to participate in the pathogenesis of AD.","1792-0981","Experimental and therapeutic medicine","(9) 2389-2393",2015,"Shize","Li","S","Department of Neurology, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, Henan 450014, P.R.

We demonstrate that the CSF proteome of individual mice can be analyzed in a quantitative manner to a depth of several hundred proteins in a robust and simple workflow consisting of single ultra HPLC runs on a benchtop mass spectrometer. The workflow is validated by a comparative analysis of BACE1-/- and wild-type mice using label-free quantification. The protease BACE1 cleaves the amyloid precursor protein (APP) as well as several other substrates and is a major drug target in Alzheimer's disease. We identified a total of 715 proteins with at least 2 unique peptides and quantified 522 of those proteins in CSF from BACE1-/- and wild-type mice. Several proteins, including the known BACE1 substrates APP, APLP1, CHL1 and contactin-2 showed lower abundance in the CSF of BACE1-/- mice, demonstrating that BACE1 substrate identification is possible from CSF. Additionally, ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase 5 was identified as a novel BACE1 substrate and validated in cells using immunoblots and by an in vitro BACE1 protease assay. Likewise, receptor-type tyrosine-protein phosphatase N2 and plexin domain-containing 2 were confirmed as BACE1 substrates by in vitro assays. Taken together, our study shows the deepest characterization of the mouse CSF proteome to date and the first quantitative analysis of the CSF proteome of individual mice. The BACE1 substrates identified in CSF may serve as biomarkers to monitor BACE1 activity in Alzheimer patients treated with BACE inhibitors.

Aβ is generated from the amyloid precursor protein by the successive action of two membrane-associated processing enzymes: β-secretase or β-site of amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and γ-secretase. Inhibition of one or both of these enzymes prevents Aβ generation and the accompanying Aβ accumulation. Antigen binding fragments from camelid heavy chain only antibodies (VHHs) were found to exert excellent enzyme inhibition activity. In the present study, we generated VHHs against BACE1 by active immunization of Lama glama with the recombinant BACE1 protein. Two classes of VHHs were selected from a VHH-phage display library by competitive elution with a peptide encoding the Swedish mutation variant of the BACE1 processing site. One VHH was found to inhibit the enzyme activity of BACE1 in vitro and in cell culture, whereas two other VHHs were found to stimulate BACE1 activity under the same conditions in vitro. Furthermore, an in vivo study with a transgenic AD mouse model, using intracisternal injection of the inhibitory VHH, led to acute reduction of the Aβ load in the blood and brain. This inhibitory VHH may be considered as a candidate molecule for a therapy directed towards reduction of Aβ load and prevention of AD progression. Both the inhibitory and stimulatory VHH may be useful for improving our understanding of the structure-function relationship of BACE1, as well as its role in AD progression.","1742-4658","The FEBS journal","(282) 3618-31",2015,"Bram","Dorresteijn","B","Biomolecular Imaging Group, Division of Cell Biology, Department of Biology, Faculty of Science, Utrecht University, The Netherlands."

DM is an ever-increasing epidemic affecting millions of elderly people worldwide, causing major repercussions on patients' daily lives, mostly due to chronic complications. Complications from DM can affect the brain, thereby characterizing DM as a risk factor for AD. In the present study, we examined the inhibitory activity of methanol extracts of different parts of 12 Angelica species against α-glucosidase, protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). The methanol extract of Angelica decursiva exhibited the highest inhibitory activities against α-glucosidase, PTP1B, AChE, and BChE and so was selected for further investigation.

Despite tremendous effort and progress in the development of BACE1 inhibitors, details of the underlying pH-dependent regulatory mechanism remain unclear. Here we elucidate the pH-dependent conformational mechanism that regulates BACE1 activity using continuous constant-pH molecular dynamics (MD). The simulations reveal that BACE1 mainly occupies three conformational states and that the relative populations of the states shift according to pH. At intermediate pH, when the catalytic dyad is monoprotonated, a binding-competent state is highly populated, while at low and high pH a Tyr-inhibited state is dominant. Our data provide strong evidence supporting conformational selection as a major mechanism for substrate and peptide-inhibitor binding. These new insights, while consistent with experiment, greatly extend the knowledge of BACE1 and have implications for further optimization of inhibitors and understanding potential side effects of targeting BACE1. Finally, the work highlights the importance of properly modeling protonation states in MD simulations.

Studies show that retromer and its receptors can make amyloid precursor protein (APP)/β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) away endosomes that reduces the production of amyloid β (Aβ). And, tetramer is also found to regulate phagocytic receptors to the plasma membrane of microglia, where some phagocytic receptors take part in Aβ clearance. Therefore, disruption of retromer will increase the production of Aβ. Recently, a plausible relationship between disturbance of retromer and tauopathies is raised. Retromer dysfunction may result in decreasing the clearance of extracellular tau and the level of cathepsin D, which enables tau-induced neurotoxicity. This review article summarizes the structure and function of retromer and its role in pathogenesis of AD.

Amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition and its associated inflammatory response are hallmarks in sporadic AD brains. Elevated expression and activity of β-secretase 1 (BACE1), the rate-limiting enzyme responsible for the β-cleavage of amyloid precursor proteins to Aβ peptides, are also observed in sporadic AD brains. Previous studies have suggested that there is therapeutic potential for retinoic acid in treating neurodegeneration based on decreased Aβ. Here we discovered that BACE1 expression is elevated in the brains of both Tg2576 transgenic mice and mice on high fat diets. These conditions are associated with a neuroinflammatory response. We found that administration of all-trans-retinoic acid (atRA) down-regulated the expression of BACE1 in the brains of Tg2576 mice and in mice fed a high fat diet. Moreover, in LPS-treated mice and cultured neurons, BACE1 expression was repressed by the addition of atRA, correlating with the anti-inflammatory efficacy of atRA. Mutations of the NFκB binding site in BACE1 promoter abolished the suppressive effect of atRA. Furthermore, atRA disrupted LPS-induced nuclear translocation of NFκB and its binding to BACE1 promoter as well as promoting the recruitment of the corepressor NCoR.

Herein, we demonstrate a generic protocol for producing polymer-supported lipid bilayers on glass surfaces that contain essentially all naturally occurring cell-membrane components of a cell line while still retaining transmembrane protein mobility and activity. This was achieved by merging vesicles made from synthetic lipids (PEGylated lipids and POPC lipids) with native cell-membrane vesicles to generate hybrid vesicles which readily rupture into a continuous polymer-supported lipid bilayer. To investigate the properties of these complex hybrid SLBs and particularly the behavior of their integral membrane-proteins, we used total internal reflection fluorescence imaging to study a transmembrane protease, β-secretase 1 (BACE1), whose ectoplasmic and cytoplasmic domains could both be specifically targeted with fluorescent reporters. By selectively probing the two different orientations of BACE1 in the resulting hybrid SLBs, the role of the PEG-cushion on transmembrane protein lateral mobility was investigated. The results reveal the necessity of having the PEGylated lipids present during vesicle adsorption to prevent immobilization of transmembrane proteins with protruding domains. The proteolytic activity of BACE1 was unadulterated by the sonication process used to merge the synthetic and native membrane vesicles; importantly it was also conserved in the SLB. The presented strategy could thus serve both fundamental studies of membrane biophysics and the production of surface-based bioanalytical sensor platforms.

26282939,"Unfolded Protein Response and PERK Kinase as a New Therapeutic Target in the Pathogenesis of Alzheimer's Disease.","Recent evidence suggests that the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and related cognitive loss is due to mutations in the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) gene on chromosome 21 and increased activation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor-2α (eIF2α) phosphorylation. The high level of misfolded and unfolded proteins loading in Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) lumen triggers ER stress and as a result Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) pathways are activated. Stress-dependent activation of the protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) leads to the significant elevation of phospho-eIF2α. That attenuates general translation and, on the other hand, promotes the preferential synthesis of Activating Transcription Factor 4 (ATF4) and secretase β (BACE1) - a pivotal enzyme responsible for the initiation of the amyloidogenic pathway resulting in the generation of the amyloid β (Aβ) variant with high ability to form toxic senile plaques in AD brains. Moreover, excessive, long-term stress conditions may contribute to inducing neuronal death by apoptosis as a result of the overactivated expression of pro-apoptotic proteins via ATF4. These findings allow to infer that dysregulated translation, increased expression of BACE1 and ATF4, as a result of eIF2α phosphorylation, may be a major contributor to structural and functional neuronal loss resulting in memory impairment. Thus, blocking PERK-dependent eIF2α phosphorylation through specific, small-molecule PERK branch inhibitors seems to be a potential treatment strategy for AD individuals. That may contribute to the restoration of global translation rates and reduction of expression of ATF4 and BACE1. Hence, the treatment strategy can block accelerated β -amyloidogenesis by reduction in APP cleaving via the BACE1-dependent amyloidogenic pathway.

Mapping of cleavage sites onto three-dimensional structures of HEPEX cis-dimer predicted conditional availability of α- and β-sites. Endocytosis of HEPCAM warrants acidification in cytoplasmic vesicles to dissociate protein cis-dimers required for cleavage by BACE1 at low pH values. Intramembrane cleavage sites are accessible and not part of the structurally important transmembrane helix dimer crossing region. Surprisingly, neither chemical inhibition of cleavage nor cellular knock-out of HEPCAM using CRISPR-Cas9 technology impacted the adhesion of carcinoma cell lines.

However, Aβ generation is precluded if APP is cleaved by the α-secretase ADAM10 instead of BACE1. We have previously shown that Aβ can be produced locally at the synapse. To study the synaptic localization of the APP processing enzymes we used western blotting to demonstrate that, compared to total brain homogenate, ADAM10 and BACE1 were greatly enriched in synaptic vesicles isolated from rat brain using controlled-pore glass chromatography, whereas Presenilin1 was the only enriched component of the γ-secretase complex. Moreover, we detected ADAM10 activity in synaptic vesicles and enrichment of the intermediate APP-C-terminal fragments (APP-CTFs). We confirmed the western blotting findings using in situ proximity ligation assay to demonstrate close proximity of ADAM10 and BACE1 with the synaptic vesicle marker synaptophysin in intact mouse primary hippocampal neurons. In contrast, only sparse co-localization of active γ-secretase and synaptophysin was detected.

Here, we show that this protease is critically involved in semaphorin 3A (Sema3A)-mediated axonal guidance processes in thalamic and hippocampal neurons. An active membrane-bound proteolytic CHL1 fragment is generated by BACE1 upon Sema3A binding. This fragment relays the Sema3A signal via ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) proteins to the neuronal cytoskeleton. APH1B-γ-secretase-mediated degradation of this fragment stops the Sema3A-induced collapse and sensitizes the growth cone for the next axonal guidance cue. Thus, we reveal a cycle of proteolytic activity underlying growth cone collapse and restoration used by axons to find their correct trajectory in the brain. Our data also suggest that BACE1 and γ-secretase inhibition have physiologically opposite effects in this process, supporting the idea that combination therapy might attenuate some of the side effects associated with these drugs.","2211-1247","Cell reports","(12) 1367-76",2015,"Soraia","Barão","S","VIB Center for the Biology of Disease, VIB-Leuven 3000, Belgium; Center for Human Genetics, Universitaire ziekenhuizen and LIND, KU Leuven, Leuven 3000, Belgium."

Previous work including ours has used BACE1 haploinsufficiency (BACE1(+/-); i.e., 50% reduction) as a therapeutic relevant model to evaluate the efficacy of partial β-secretase inhibition. However, it is unclear whether the extent of Aβ reductions in amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice with BACE1(+/-) gene ablation may vary with sex or disease progression. Here, we compared the impacts of BACE1 haploinsufficiency on Aβ concentrations and APP processing in 5XFAD Alzheimer mice (1) between males and females and (2) between different stages with moderate and robust Aβ accumulation. First, male and female 5XFAD mice at 6-7 months of age showed equivalent levels of Aβ, BACE1, full-length APP and its metabolites. BACE1 haploinsufficiency significantly lowered soluble Aβ oligomers, total Aβ42 levels and plaque burden in 5XFAD mouse brains irrespective of sex. Furthermore, there was no sex difference in reductions of β-cleavage products of APP (C99 and sAPPβ) found in BACE1(+/-)·5XFAD mice relative to BACE1(+/+)·5XFAD controls. Meanwhile, APP and sAPPα levels in BACE1(+/-)·5XFAD mice were higher than those of 5XFAD controls regardless of sex. Based on these observations, we next combined male and female data to examine the effects of BACE1 haploinsufficiency in 5XFAD mice at 12-14 months of age, as compared with those in 6-7-month-old 5XFAD mice. Oligomeric Aβ and C99 levels were dramatically elevated in older 5XFAD mice. Although the β-metabolites of APP were significantly reduced by BACE1 haploinsufficiency in both age groups, high levels of these toxic amyloidogenic fragments remained in 12-14-month-old BACE1(+/-)·5XFAD mice. The present findings are consistent with our previous behavioral data showing that BACE1 haploinsufficiency rescues memory deficits in 5XFAD mice irrespective of sex but only in the younger age group.","1873-7544","Neuroscience","(307) 128-37",2015,"L","Devi","L","Center for Dementia Research, Nathan Kline Institute, Orangeburg, NY, USA."

Here, we describe a potential mechanism by which BACE activity is increased in AD brains. First, we show that BACE1 is phosphorylated by the p25/Cdk5 complex at Thr252 and that this phosphorylation increases BACE1 activity. Then, we demonstrate that the level of phospho-BACE1 is increased in the brains of AD patients and in mammalian cells and transgenic mice that overexpress p25. Furthermore, the fraction of p25 prepared from iodixanol gradient centrifugation was unexpectedly protected by protease digestion, suggesting that p25/Cdk5-mediated BACE1 phosphorylation may occur in the lumen.

26322584,"η-Secretase processing of APP inhibits neuronal activity in the hippocampus.","Alzheimer disease (AD) is characterized by the accumulation of amyloid plaques, which are predominantly composed of amyloid-β peptide. Two principal physiological pathways either prevent or promote amyloid-β generation from its precursor, β-amyloid precursor protein (APP), in a competitive manner. Although APP processing has been studied in great detail, unknown proteolytic events seem to hinder stoichiometric analyses of APP metabolism in vivo. Here we describe a new physiological APP processing pathway, which generates proteolytic fragments capable of inhibiting neuronal activity within the hippocampus. We identify higher molecular mass carboxy-terminal fragments (CTFs) of APP, termed CTF-η, in addition to the long-known CTF-α and CTF-β fragments generated by the α- and β-secretases ADAM10 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10) and BACE1 (β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1), respectively. CTF-η generation is mediated in part by membrane-bound matrix metalloproteinases such as MT5-MMP, referred to as η-secretase activity. η-Secretase cleavage occurs primarily at amino acids 504-505 of APP695, releasing a truncated ectodomain. After shedding of this ectodomain, CTF-η is further processed by ADAM10 and BACE1 to release long and short Aη peptides (termed Aη-α and Aη-β). CTFs produced by η-secretase are enriched in dystrophic neurites in an AD mouse model and in human AD brains. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of BACE1 activity results in robust accumulation of CTF-η and Aη-α. In mice treated with a potent BACE1 inhibitor, hippocampal long-term potentiation was reduced. Notably, when recombinant or synthetic Aη-α was applied on hippocampal slices ex vivo, long-term potentiation was lowered. Furthermore, in vivo single-cell two-photon calcium imaging showed that hippocampal neuronal activity was attenuated by Aη-α. These findings not only demonstrate a major functionally relevant APP processing pathway, but may also indicate potential translational relevance for therapeutic strategies targeting APP processing.

Because inhibition of BACE1 decreases glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β)-mediated Alzheimer's disease (AD)-like tau phosphorylation in AD patient-derived neurons, we determined whether sAPPα also reduces GSK3β-mediated tau phosphorylation. We initially found increased levels of inhibitory phosphorylation of GSK3β (Ser9) in primary neurons from sAPPα over-expressing mice. Further, recombinant human sAPPα evoked the same phenomenon in SH-SY5Y cells. Further, in SH-SY5Y cells over-expressing BACE1, and HeLa cells over-expressing human tau, sAPPα reduced GSK3β activity and tau phosphorylation. Importantly, the reductions in GSK3β activity and tau phosphorylation elicited by sAPPα were prevented by BACE1 but not γ-secretase inhibition. In accord, AD mice over-expressing human sAPPα had less GSK3β activity and tau phosphorylation compared with controls. These results implicate a direct relationship between APP β-processing and GSK3β-mediated tau phosphorylation and further define the central role of sAPPα in APP autoregulation and AD pathogenesis.","1471-4159","Journal of neurochemistry","(135) 630-7",2015,"Juan","Deng","J","Rashid Laboratory for Developmental Neurobiology, Department of Psychiatry & Behavioral Neurosciences, Morsani College of Medicine, Silver Child Development Center, University of South Florida, Tampa, Florida, USA."

Epidemiological studies have revealed an association between folic acid deficiency and AD risk. However, the effects of folic acid deficiency on miRNA expression in AD animals have not been observed. We aimed to find if folic acid deficiency may enhance amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide deposition and regulate amyloid-associated miRNAs and their target genes expression in APP/PS1 mice. APP/PS1 mice and N2a cells were treated with folic acid-deficient diet or medium. Cognitive function of mice was assessed using the Morris water maze. miRNA profile was tested by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) array. Different expressional miRNAs were validated by real-time PCR. The deposition of Aβ plaques was evaluated by immunohistochemistry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. APP and BACE1 proteins in mice brain and N2a cells were determined by Western blot. Folic acid deficiency aggravated amyloid pathology in AD mice. The AD+FD group showed shorter time spent in the target zone during the probe test. Analysis of miRNAs predicted to target these genes revealed several miRNA candidates that were differentially modulated by folic acid deficiency. In APP/PS1 mice brains and N2a cells with folic acid-deficient treatment, miR-106a-5p, miR-200b-3p and miR-339-5p were down-regulated, and their target genes APP and BACE1 were up-regulated.

Hence, this study was designed to investigate the protective effects of icariin, a major constituent of flavonoids from the Chinese medicinal herb Epimedium brevicornum, on cognitive impairments and neuronal morphological damage induced by permanent occlusion of bilateral common carotid arteries (BCCAO) in rats, and further explore the potential mechanisms. This study found that BCCAO could induce cognitive deficits and neuronal morphological damage, along with deposition of beta-amyloid (Aβ) in rat hippocampus. However, oral administration of icariin twice per day for 23days might attenuate cognitive deficits and neuronal morphological damage induced by BCCAO. Subsequently, icariin decreased the level of Aβ in rat hippocampus subjected to BCCAO. Administration of icariin reduced the expressions of amyloid precursor protein (APP), beta-secretase 1 (BACE1), and increased the expressions of insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) and a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain 10 (ADAM10) in rat hippocampus. Furthermore, icariin afforded beneficial actions in suppressing transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) signaling via inhibition of Smad2/3 phosphorylation. In summary, icariin is effective in improving cognitive deficits and hippocampus morphological alterations subjected to BCCAO. This protection appears to be due to the decreased expressions of both APP and BACE1, and the increased expressions of both IDE and ADAM10, resulting in a decrease in the level of insoluble Aβ fragments in rat hippocampus. Inhibitions of TGF-β1 signaling and Smad2/3 phosphorylation are involved in the course.

Amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques deposition and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) are the prominent age-dependent pathologies implicated in the cognitive deficits. Accumulation of mis-folded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum triggers a cellular stress response called the unfolded protein response (UPR), the activation of which is increased in AD patients. However, the UPR relates to the pathological hallmarks of aging is still elusive. In this study, we report that long-term supplement of α-linolenic acid (ALA), starting before the onset of disease symptoms (6month-old), prevents the age-related memory deficits during natural aging. The amelioration of the memory impairment is associated with a decrease in UPR related markers [glucose regulated protein 78 (GRP78), protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), eukaryotic Initiation Factor 2α (eIF2α)]. ALA suppressed the PERK/eIF2α signaling, which may be responsible for multifaceted memory-deteriorating and neurodegenerative mechanisms, including inhibition of Aβ production by suppressing β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) expression, enhancement of cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) function via down-regulating activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), and suppression of Tau phosphorylation by inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) pathway.

Our data thus reveal a novel mechanistic role played by sAβPPα in regulating overproduction of Aβ and restoring neuronal homeostasis and neuroprotection.

Here, we investigated α-, β-, and γ-secretase activities in human brain with respect to δOR-Phe27Cys variation in the temporal cortex of 71 subjects with varying degree of AD-related neurofibrillary pathology (Braak stages I-VI). As a result, a significant increase in β- (p = 0.03) and γ- (p = 0.01), but not α-secretase, activities was observed in late stage AD samples (Braak stages V-VI), which were heterozygous for δOR-Phe27Cys as compared to the δOR-Phe27 and δOR-Cys27 homozygotes. The augmented β-secretase activity was not associated with increased mRNA expression or protein levels of BACE1 in the late stage AD patients, who were heterozygous for the δOR-Phe27Cys variation. These findings suggest that δOR-Phe27Cys variation modulates β- and γ-secretase activity in the late stages of AD likely via post-translational mechanisms other than alterations in the mRNA or protein levels of BACE1, or, in the expression of γ-secretase complex components.

A variety of cellular mechanisms, such as altered Akt and AMPK and increased inflammatory signaling, contribute to neurodegeneration. Exercise training can improve markers of neurodegeneration, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of a single bout of exercise on markers of neurodegeneration and inflammation in brains from mice fed a high-fat diet. Male C57BL/6 mice were fed a low (LFD; 10% kcal from lard)- or a high-fat diet (HFD; 60% kcal from lard) for 7 wk. HFD mice underwent an acute bout of exercise (treadmill running: 15 m/min, 5% incline, 120 min) followed by a recovery period of 2 h. The HFD increased body mass and glucose intolerance (both P < 0.05). This was accompanied by an approximately twofold increase in the phosphorylation of Akt, ERK, and GSK in the cortex (P < 0.05). Following exercise, there was a decrease in beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1; P < 0.05) and activity (P < 0.001). This was accompanied by a reduction in AMPK phosphorylation, indicative of a decline in cellular stress (P < 0.05). Akt and ERK phosphorylation were decreased following exercise in HFD mice to a level similar to that of the LFD mice (P < 0.05). This study demonstrates that a single bout of exercise can reduce BACE1 content and activity independent of changes in adiposity.

We reported that a high fat diet (HFD) promotes amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleavage by β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) without increasing BACE1 levels in APP transgenic mice. However, the detailed mechanism had remained unclear. Here we demonstrate that HFD promotes BACE1/Adaptor protein-2 (AP-2)/clathrin complex formation by increasing AP-2 levels in APP transgenic mice. In Swedish APP overexpressing Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells as well as in SH-SY5Y cells, overexpression of AP-2 promoted the formation of BACE1/AP-2/clathrin complex, increasing the level of the soluble form of APP β (sAPPβ). On the other hand, mutant D495R BACE1, which inhibits formation of this trimeric complex, was shown to decrease the level of sAPPβ. Overexpression of AP-2 promoted the internalization of BACE1 from the cell surface, thus reducing the cell surface BACE1 level. As such, we concluded that HFD may induce the formation of the BACE1/AP-2/clathrin complex, which is followed by its transport of BACE1 from the cell surface to the intracellular compartments. These events might be associated with the enhancement of β-site cleavage of APP in APP transgenic mice.

Recent findings have revealed that nitric oxide (NO) modulates the processing of amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) and alters Aβ production; however, the previously presented data are contradictory and the underlying molecular mechanisms are still incomplete. Here, using human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells stably transfected with wild-type APPwt695, we found that NO, derived from NO donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP), bi-directionally modulates APP processing in vitro. The data from ELISA and Western blot (WB) tests indicated that SNP at lower concentrations (0.01 and 0.1 μM) inhibits BACE1 expression, thus consequently suppresses APP β-cleavage and decreases Aβ production. In contrast, SNP at higher concentrations (10 and 20 μM) biases the APP processing toward the amyloidogenic pathway as evidenced by an increased BACE1 but a decreased ADAM10 expression, together with an elevated Aβ secretion. This bi-directional modulating activity of SNP on APP processing was completely blocked by specific NO scavenger c-PTIO, indicating NO-dependent mechanisms. Moreover, the anti-amyloidogenic activity of SNP is sGC/cGMP/PKG-dependent as evidenced by its reversal by sGC/PKG inhibitions, whereas the amyloidogenic activity of SNP is peroxynitrite-related and can be reversed by peroxynitrite scavenger uric acid. In summary, these present findings predict a double-edged role of NO in APP processing in vitro. Low (physiological) levels of NO inhibit the amyloidogenic processing of APP, whereas extra-high (pathological) concentrations of NO favor the amyloidogenic pathway of APP processing. This preliminary study may provide further evidence to clarify the molecular roles of NO and NO-related signaling in AD and supply potential molecular targets for AD treatment.

We report here that the type I membrane protein BACE1 (β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1), which is best known for its detrimental role in Alzheimer's disease, but is also, as reported here, present in cardiac myocytes, serves as a novel interaction partner of KCNQ1. Using HEK293T cells as heterologous expression system to study the electrophysiological effects of BACE1 and KCNE1 on KCNQ1 in different combinations, our main findings were the following: (1) BACE1 slowed the inactivation of KCNQ1 current producing an increased initial response to depolarizing voltage steps. (2) Activation kinetics of KCNQ1/E1 currents were significantly slowed in the presence of co-expressed BACE1. (3) BACE1 impaired reconstituted cardiac IKs when cardiac action potentials were used as voltage commands, but interestingly augmented the IKs of ATP-deprived cells, suggesting that the effect of BACE1 depends on the metabolic state of the cell. (4) The electrophysiological effects of BACE1 on KCNQ1 reported here were independent of its enzymatic activity, as they were preserved when the proteolytically inactive variant BACE1 D289N was co-transfected in lieu of BACE1 or when BACE1-expressing cells were treated with the BACE1-inhibiting compound C3. (5) Co-immunoprecipitation and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) supported our hypothesis that BACE1 modifies the biophysical properties of IKs by physically interacting with KCNQ1 in a β-subunit-like fashion. Strongly underscoring the functional significance of this interaction, we detected BACE1 in human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes and murine cardiac tissue and observed decreased IKs in atrial cardiomyocytes of BACE1-deficient mice.

Oxysterols have been shown to exert several in vitro and in vivo biochemical activities of both physiologic and pathologic relevance and they appear to be implicated in the pathogenesis of various age-related chronic diseases, including atherosclerosis and Alzheimer's disease (AD), where hypercholesterolemia represents a primary risk factor, and a redox state impairment and inflammation seem to play a central role. Our recent studies show that, in cells of the macrophage lineage or in human neuronal cells (differentiated or not), respectively in the contest of atherosclerosis or AD, oxysterols can initiate specific signal transduction pathways that are relevant to the development of these diseases. Regarding atherosclerosis, we have observed that oxysterols can contribute to plaque instability and rupture by enhancing inflammatory responses and matrix turnover through an unbalanced up-regulation of MMP-9. Concerning AD, we have demonstrated that oxysterols may promote neuroinflammatory changes and accelerate APP processing toward β-amyloid production by up-regulating APP and BACE1 protein levels. In addition, TLR4, a key player of immune and inflammatory signaling responses, seems to have an important role in the pathogenesis of both atherosclerosis and AD.

26465092,"Neurological dysfunctions associated with altered BACE1-dependent Neuregulin-1 signaling.","Inhibition of BACE1 is being pursued as a therapeutic target to treat patients suffering from Alzheimer's disease because BACE1 is the sole β-secretase that generates β-amyloid peptide. Knowledge regarding other cellular functions of BACE1 is therefore critical for the safe use of BACE1 inhibitors in human patients. Neuregulin-1 (Nrg1) is a BACE1 substrate and BACE1 cleavage of Nrg1 is critical for signaling functions in myelination, remyelination, synaptic plasticity, normal psychiatric behaviors, and maintenance of muscle spindles. This review summarizes the most recent discoveries associated with BACE1-dependent Nrg1 signaling in these areas. This body of knowledge will help to provide guidance for preventing unwanted Nrg1-based side effects following BACE1 inhibition in humans. To initiate its signaling cascade, membrane anchored Neuregulin (Nrg), mainly type I and III β1 Nrg1 isoforms and Nrg3, requires ectodomain shedding. BACE1 is one of such indispensable sheddases to release the functional Nrg signaling fragment. The dependence of Nrg on the cleavage by BACE1 is best manifested by disrupting the critical role of Nrg in the control of axonal myelination, schizophrenic behaviors as well as the formation and maintenance of muscle spindles.

26467158,"Bisecting GlcNAc modification stabilizes BACE1 protein under oxidative stress conditions.","β-Site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE1) is a protease essential for amyloid-β (Aβ) production in Alzheimer's disease (AD). BACE1 protein is known to be up-regulated by oxidative stress-inducing stimuli but the mechanism for this up-regulation still needs to be clarified. We have recently found that BACE1 is modified with bisecting N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) by N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-III (GnT-III, encoded by the Mgat3 gene) and that GnT-III deficiency reduces Aβ-plaque formation in the brain by accelerating lysosomal degradation of BACE1. Therefore, we hypothesized that bisecting GlcNAc would stabilize BACE1 protein on oxidative stress. In the present study, we first show that Aβ deposition in the mouse brain induces oxidative stress, together with an increase in levels of BACE1 and bisecting GlcNAc. Furthermore, prooxidant treatment induces expression of BACE1 protein in wild-type mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs), whereas it reduces BACE1 protein in GnT-III (Mgat3) knock-out MEFs by accelerating lysosomal degradation of BACE1. We purified BACE1 from Neuro2A cells and performed LC/ESI/MS analysis for BACE1-derived glycopeptides and mapped bisecting GlcNAc-modified sites on BACE1. Point mutations at two N-glycosylation sites (Asn(153) and Asn(223)) abolish the bisecting GlcNAc modification on BACE1. These mutations almost cancelled the enhanced BACE1 degradation seen in Mgat3(-/-) MEFs, indicating that bisecting GlcNAc on BACE1 indeed regulates its degradation. Finally, we show that traumatic brain injury-induced BACE1 up-regulation is significantly suppressed in the Mgat3(-/-) brain. These results highlight the role of bisecting GlcNAc in oxidative stress-induced BACE1 expression and offer a novel glycan-targeted strategy for suppressing Aβ generation.

Increased levels of brain Aβ have been implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Thus, β-secretase represents a primary target for inhibitor drug development in AD. In this study, aptamers were obtained from combinatorial oligonucleotide libraries using a technology referred to as systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX). A purified human BACE1 extracellular domain was used as a target to conduct an in vitro selection process using SELEX. Two DNA aptamers were capable of binding to BACE1 with high affinity and good specificity, with Kd values in the nanomolar range. We subsequently confirmed that one aptamer, A1, exhibited a distinct inhibitory effect on BACE1 activity in an AD cell model. We detected the effects of M17-APPsw cells that stably expressed Swedish mutant APP after aptamer A1 treatment. Aβ40 and Aβ42 concentrations secreted by M17-APPsw cells decreased intracellularly and in culture media. Furthermore, Western blot analysis indicated that sAPPβ expression significantly decreased in the A1 treated versus control groups. These findings support the preliminary feasibility of an aptamer evolved from a SELEX strategy to function as a potential BACE1 inhibitor.

26483636,"BACE1 activity impairs neuronal glucose oxidation: rescue by beta-hydroxybutyrate and lipoic acid.","Glucose hypometabolism and impaired mitochondrial function in neurons have been suggested to play early and perhaps causative roles in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Activity of the aspartic acid protease, beta-site amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), responsible for beta amyloid peptide generation, has recently been demonstrated to modify glucose metabolism. We therefore examined, using a human neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cell line, whether increased BACE1 activity is responsible for a reduction in cellular glucose metabolism. Overexpression of active BACE1, but not a protease-dead mutant BACE1, protein in SH-SY5Y cells reduced glucose oxidation and the basal oxygen consumption rate, which was associated with a compensatory increase in glycolysis. Increased BACE1 activity had no effect on the mitochondrial electron transfer process but was found to diminish substrate delivery to the mitochondria by inhibition of key mitochondrial decarboxylation reaction enzymes. This BACE1 activity-dependent deficit in glucose oxidation was alleviated by the presence of beta hydroxybutyrate or α-lipoic acid. Consequently our data indicate that raised cellular BACE1 activity drives reduced glucose oxidation in a human neuronal cell line through impairments in the activity of specific tricarboxylic acid cycle enzymes. Because this bioenergetic deficit is recoverable by neutraceutical compounds we suggest that such agents, perhaps in conjunction with BACE1 inhibitors, may be an effective therapeutic strategy in the early-stage management or treatment of AD.

The receptor for advanced glycation end product (RAGE) is a cellular binding site for Aβ peptide and mediates amyloid β-induced perturbations in cerebral vessels, neurons, and microglia in AD. Here, we identified a specific high-affinity RAGE inhibitor (APDTKTQ named RP-1) from a phage display library. RP-1 bound to RAGE and inhibited Aβ peptide-induced cellular stress in human neuroblastoma SH-SYSY cells in vitro. Three amino acids in RP-1 are identical to those in the Aβ peptide. RP-1 shows high homology to the 16-23 (KLVFFAED) regions in Aβ peptide and high-affinity RAGE. Functional analyses indicated that RP-1 significantly reduced the level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ROS products and that it enhanced catalase and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity. Furthermore, it inactivated caspase3 and caspase9 and inhibited the upregulation of RAGE, nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), and beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) protein expression. In addition, RP-1 activated the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, inhibiting the interaction between Bax and Bcl-2.

We now mapped the synaptic localization of APP, ADAM10, and BACE1 in the mouse cerebral cortex. All three proteins were present in cortical synapses and subsynaptic fractionation revealed that APP was located mainly in the pre-synaptic active zone (53 %) and in the post-synaptic density (37 %), whereas ADAM10 was enriched in the post-synaptic density (61 %) and BACE1 was concentrated in extra-synaptic regions (72 %). Immunocytochemistry analysis further showed that APP and BACE1 were co-localized in about 30 % of both glutamatergic and GABAergic terminals, whereas few terminals were endowed with ADAM10. This distribution is modified in a mouse model of early AD based on Aβ1-42-intracerebroventricular injection, where the synaptic levels of APP and ADAM10 increased by 30 %, whereas BACE1 levels were reduced. This suggests that, in early AD, there are compensatory mechanisms to avoid Aβ overload in cortical synapses favoring the non-amyloidogenic processing of APP.","1559-1182","Molecular neurobiology","(53) 5710-21",2016,"Anna","Pliássova","A","CNC-Center for Neuroscience and Cell Biology, University of Coimbra, 3004-504, Coimbra, Portugal."

The reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that acacetin reduced both the human APP and BACE-1 mRNA levels in the transgenic flies, suggesting that it plays an important role in the transcriptional regulation of human BACE-1 and APP. Western blot analysis revealed that acacetin reduced Aβ production by interfering with BACE-1 activity and APP synthesis, resulting in a decrease in the levels of the APP carboxy-terminal fragments and the APP intracellular domain. Therefore, the protective effect of acacetin on Aβ production is mediated by transcriptional regulation of BACE-1 and APP, resulting in decreased APP protein expression and BACE-1 activity.

The serious databases were researched to identify studies. The association between BACE1 (exon5 C/G, intron 5 T/G or 3'UTR T/A) polymorphism and SAD risk was evaluated by odds ratios (ORs) together with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

JNK subfamily is encoded by three separate but related genes: jnk1, jnk2, and jnk3, giving rise to at least ten distinct splice variants of the JNK proteins. JNK3 is thought to be a major contributor to neurodegeneration in mammalian brain. The role of JNK1 in the pathological processes affecting cognitive function, especially in diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), is less clear. In order to evaluate the effects of JNK1 deficiency in an experimental model of familial Alzheimer's disease, double transgenic APPswe/PS1dE9 mice were crossed with the JNK1 heterozygous deficient animals (jnk1+/-). As expected, a ∼50 % reduction in JNK1 protein levels was observed in the hippocampi of 9-month-old APPswe/PS1dE9/jnk1+/- mice, compared with the APPswe/PS1dE9 group. JNK1 deficiency resulted in reduced BACE1 expression, suggesting alterations in amyloidogenic pathway. However, no significant inter-group differences in the total number of β-amyloid plaques were observed in the hippocampal region. In addition, protein levels of PPAR gamma coactivator-1α (PGC-1α), a molecule involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and energy homeostasis, were decreased in 9-month-old APPswe/PS1dE9 mice but not in APPswe/PS1dE9/jnk1+/- animals. Furthermore, JNK1 deficiency did not have an effect on pro-inflammatory marker expression in the hippocampus. Heterozygous deficiency of JNK1 results in the decrease of BACE1 protein levels, which is not accompanied by the reduction in the total number of β-amyloid plaques in the hippocampi of APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. Moreover, PGC-1α expression is restored in APPswe/PS1dE9/jnk1+/- animals, which indicates a possible role of JNK1 in brain mitochondrial regulation. Nevertheless, our results suggest that partial inhibition of JNK1 is not sufficient to prevent the neuropathological processes in this model.

26563932,"Relationship between ubiquilin-1 and BACE1 in human Alzheimer's disease and APdE9 transgenic mouse brain and cell-based models.","Accumulation of β-amyloid (Aβ) and phosphorylated tau in the brain are central events underlying Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Aβ is generated from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and γ-secretase-mediated cleavages. Ubiquilin-1, a ubiquitin-like protein, genetically associates with AD and affects APP trafficking, processing and degradation. Here, we have investigated ubiquilin-1 expression in human brain in relation to AD-related neurofibrillary pathology and the effects of ubiquilin-1 overexpression on BACE1, tau, neuroinflammation, and neuronal viability in vitro in co-cultures of mouse embryonic primary cortical neurons and microglial cells under acute neuroinflammation as well as neuronal cell lines, and in vivo in the brain of APdE9 transgenic mice at the early phase of the development of Aβ pathology. Ubiquilin-1 expression was decreased in human temporal cortex in relation to the early stages of AD-related neurofibrillary pathology (Braak stages 0-II vs. III-IV). There was a trend towards a positive correlation between ubiquilin-1 and BACE1 protein levels. Consistent with this, ubiquilin-1 overexpression in the neuron-microglia co-cultures with or without the induction of neuroinflammation resulted in a significant increase in endogenously expressed BACE1 levels. Sustained ubiquilin-1 overexpression in the brain of APdE9 mice resulted in a moderate, but insignificant increase in endogenous BACE1 levels and activity, coinciding with increased levels of soluble Aβ40 and Aβ42. BACE1 levels were also significantly increased in neuronal cells co-overexpressing ubiquilin-1 and BACE1. Ubiquilin-1 overexpression led to the stabilization of BACE1 protein levels, potentially through a mechanism involving decreased degradation in the lysosomal compartment.

26574544,"Proteolytic Processing of Neuregulin 1 Type III by Three Intramembrane-cleaving Proteases.","Numerous membrane-bound proteins undergo regulated intramembrane proteolysis. Regulated intramembrane proteolysis is initiated by shedding, and the remaining stubs are further processed by intramembrane-cleaving proteases (I-CLiPs). Neuregulin 1 type III (NRG1 type III) is a major physiological substrate of β-secretase (β-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1)). BACE1-mediated cleavage is required to allow signaling of NRG1 type III. Because of the hairpin nature of NRG1 type III, two membrane-bound stubs with a type 1 and a type 2 orientation are generated by proteolytic processing. We demonstrate that these stubs are substrates for three I-CLiPs. The type 1-oriented stub is further cleaved by γ-secretase at an ϵ-like site five amino acids N-terminal to the C-terminal membrane anchor and at a γ-like site in the middle of the transmembrane domain. The ϵ-cleavage site is only one amino acid N-terminal to a Val/Leu substitution associated with schizophrenia. The mutation reduces generation of the NRG1 type III β-peptide as well as reverses signaling. Moreover, it affects the cleavage precision of γ-secretase at the γ-site similar to certain Alzheimer disease-associated mutations within the amyloid precursor protein. The type 2-oriented membrane-retained stub of NRG1 type III is further processed by signal peptide peptidase-like proteases SPPL2a and SPPL2b. Expression of catalytically inactive aspartate mutations as well as treatment with 2,2'-(2-oxo-1,3-propanediyl)bis[(phenylmethoxy)carbonyl]-l-leucyl-l-leucinamide ketone inhibits formation of N-terminal intracellular domains and the corresponding secreted C-peptide. Thus, NRG1 type III is the first protein substrate that is not only cleaved by multiple sheddases but is also processed by three different I-CLiPs.

26582141,"Differential contributions of ApoE4 and female sex to BACE1 activity and expression mediate Aβ deposition and learning and memory in mouse models of Alzheimer's disease.","Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, disproportionately affects women in both prevalence and severity. This increased vulnerability to AD in women is strongly associated with age-related ovarian hormone loss and apolipoprotein E 4 allele (ApoE4), the most important genetic risk factor for sporadic AD. Up to date, the mechanism involved in the interaction between ApoE4 and sex/gender in AD is still unclear. This study evaluated the sex-dependent ApoE4 effects on learning and memory, Aβ deposition and potential mechanisms, using mice bearing both sporadic (ApoE4) and familial (APPSwe, PS1M146V, tauP301L; 3xTg) AD risk factors and compared with sex- and age-matched 3xTg or nonTg mice. Compared to nonTg mice, transgenic mice of both sexes showed spatial learning and memory deficits in the radial arm water maze and novel arm discrimination tests at 20 months of age. However, at 10 months, only ApoE4/3xTg mice showed significant learning and memory impairment. Moreover, molecular studies of hippocampal tissue revealed significantly higher protein levels of Aβ species, β-site APP cleavage enzyme (BACE1) and Sp1, a transcription factor of BACE1, in female ApoE4/3xTg when compared with female nonTg, female 3xTg, and male ApoE4/3xTg mice. Significantly increased BACE1 enzymatic activities were observed in both male and female mice carrying ApoE4; however, only the females showed significant higher BACE1 expressions. Together, these data suggest that ApoE4 allele is associated with increased BACE1 enzymatic activity, while female sex plays an important role in increasing BACE1 expression. The combination of both provides a molecular basis for high Aβ pathology and the resultant hippocampus-dependent learning and memory deficits in female ApoE4 carriers.

26582976,"Extracellular proteolysis in structural and functional plasticity of mossy fiber synapses in hippocampus.","Brain is continuously altered in response to experience and environmental changes. One of the underlying mechanisms is synaptic plasticity, which is manifested by modification of synapse structure and function. It is becoming clear that regulated extracellular proteolysis plays a pivotal role in the structural and functional remodeling of synapses during brain development, learning and memory formation. Clearly, plasticity mechanisms may substantially differ between projections. Mossy fiber synapses onto CA3 pyramidal cells display several unique functional features, including pronounced short-term facilitation, a presynaptically expressed long-term potentiation (LTP) that is independent of NMDAR activation, and NMDA-dependent metaplasticity. Moreover, structural plasticity at mossy fiber synapses ranges from the reorganization of projection topology after hippocampus-dependent learning, through intrinsically different dynamic properties of synaptic boutons to pre- and postsynaptic structural changes accompanying LTP induction. Although concomitant functional and structural plasticity in this pathway strongly suggests a role of extracellular proteolysis, its impact only starts to be investigated in this projection. In the present report, we review the role of extracellular proteolysis in various aspects of synaptic plasticity in hippocampal mossy fiber synapses. A growing body of evidence demonstrates that among perisynaptic proteases, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA)/plasmin system, β-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and metalloproteinases play a crucial role in shaping plastic changes in this projection. We discuss recent advances and emerging hypotheses on the roles of proteases in mechanisms underlying mossy fiber target specific synaptic plasticity and memory formation.

26592717,"Sox2 functionally interacts with βAPP, the βAPP intracellular domain and ADAM10 at a transcriptional level in human cells.","Sox2 (SRY (Sex-determining region Y)-related high mobility group (HMG) box 2) is a transcription factor that serves key roles in controlling the balance between stem cells maintenance and commitment to differentiated lineages throughout the lifetime. Importantly, Sox2 deficiency results in early embryonic lethality whereas the down-regulation of Sox2 expression triggers neurodegeneration in the adult mouse brain. Moreover, Sox2 is decreased in the brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and co localizes with the β-amyloid precursor protein (βAPP) in stem cells. Here we report the existence of functional interactions between Sox2 and βAPP, the βAPP intracellular domain AICD50 and the α-secretase ADAM10 in human cells. We first show, as observed in embryonic stem cells, that βAPP overexpression in HEK293 cells results in an increase of Sox2 immunoreactivity and we further establish the transcriptional nature of this pathway. Moreover, overexpression of the pro-apoptotic C-terminal βAPP-derived AICD50 metabolite leads to the down-regulation of Sox2 transcription whereas the pharmacological inhibition of endogenous AICD production increases Sox2 expression in both HEK293 and SH-SY5Y cell lines. In addition, we demonstrate that Sox2 is a potent activator of the non amyloidogenic processing of βAPP as shown by the Sox2-dependent augmentation of ADAM10 catalytic activity, immunoreactivity, promoter transactivation and mRNA levels with no modification of the activity and the expression of the β-secretase BACE1. Finally, the fact that γ-secretase inhibition induces an increase of ADAM10 protein levels in SH-SY5Y cells further supports the occurrence of functional AICD/Sox2/ADAM10 interactions. Altogether, our study identifies and characterizes new functional cross-talks between Sox2 and proteins involved in AD, thereby adding support to the view that Sox2 likely behaves as a protective factor during the development of this neurodegenerative disease.

26593275,"Acceleration of amyloidogenesis and memory impairment by estrogen deficiency through NF-κB dependent beta-secretase activation in presenilin 2 mutant mice.","Nearly 7-10 million people are living with Alzheimer's disease (AD) worldwide. Senile plaques composed of β-amyloid (Aβ) are a pathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease. Presenilin 2 (PS2) mutations increase Aβ generation in the brains of AD patients. The Aβ is generated through the sequential cleavage of amyloid precursor protein by β- and γ-secretases. Additionally, increasing evidences suggest that estrogen can reduce the development of AD via regulation of β-secretases activity and beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme (BACE1) expression. But the underlying correlation mechanism of Aβ generation by PS2 mutations and estrogen remains to be clarified. To investigate the anti-amyloidogenesis effect of estrogen in a PS2 mutative condition, we examined memory impairment in ovariectomized PS2 mutation (N141I) mice in which cognitive function was assessed by the Morris water maze test and passive avoidance test. In addition, Western blot analysis, immunostaining, immunofluorescence staining, ELISA and enzyme activity assays were used to examine the degree of Aβ deposition in the brains. In the present study, Aβ accumulated more in the ovariectomized PS2 mutant mice brain, and greatly worsened memory impairment and glial activation as well as neurogenic inflammation. In parallel with increased memory impairment, activity of β-secretase and expression of the BACE1 increased inovariectomized PS2 mutant mice. Much higher activity of NF-κB was observed by EMSA in ovariectomized PS2 mutant mice. In addition, the Aβ level was decreased by treatment of β-estradiol through inhibiting BACE1 expression in PS2 transfacted PC12 cells. These results suggest that mutation of PS2 can lead to NF-κB mediate amyloidogensis, and this effect can be amplified by the absence of estrogen.

We now report on a novel compound, AF710B, a highly potent and selective allosteric M1 muscarinic and σ1 receptor agonist. AF710B exhibits an allosteric agonistic profile on the M1 muscarinic receptor; very low concentrations of AF710B significantly potentiated the binding and efficacy of carbachol on M1 receptors and their downstream effects (p-ERK1/2, p-CREB). AF710B (1-30 µg/kg, p.o.) was a potent and safe cognitive enhancer in rats treated with the M1 antagonist trihexyphenidyl (passive avoidance impairment). These effects of AF710B involve σ1 receptor activation. In agreement with its antiamnesic properties, AF710B (at 30 nM), via activation of M1 and a possible involvement of σ1 receptors, rescued mushroom synapse loss in PS1-KI and APP-KI neuronal cultures, while AF267B (1 µM) was less potent in PS1-KI and ineffective in APP-KI models, respectively. In female 3xTg-AD mice, AF710B (10 µg/kg, i.p./daily/2 months) (i) mitigated cognitive impairments in the Morris water maze; (ii) decreased BACE1, GSK3β activity, p25/CDK5, neuroinflammation, soluble and insoluble Aβ40, Aβ42, plaques and tau pathologies. AF710B differs from conventional σ1 and M1 muscarinic (orthosteric, allosteric or bitopic) agonists. These results highlight AF710B as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease (e.g. improving cognitive deficits, synaptic loss, amyloid and tau pathologies, and neuroinflammation) with a superior profile over a plethora of other therapeutic strategies.","1660-2862","Neuro-degenerative diseases","(16) 95-110",2016,"Abraham","Fisher","A",""

Two key enzymes ADAM10 and BACE1 are involved in the initial cleavage of APP, resulting in the onset of two pathways, the amyloidogenic pathway and the non-amyloidogenic pathway, respectively. Altering APP metabolism towards the non-amyloidogenic pathway is thought to reduce Aβ production. It has been reported that, in vivo, exogenous neurotrophic factors make APP apt to entering the non-amyloidogenic pathway. Since astrocytes secrete a battery of neurotrophic factors, we investigated the role of astrocyte-derived factors in the dynamics of Aβ generation in neural cells. Results show that C6 glioma cell-conditioned medium (GCM), obtained from cultured astrocyte-derived C6 glioma cells, inhibit Aβ1-42 production and shift APP processing towards the non-amyloidogenic pathway in APPswe-HEK293 cells. Such effect is attributed to two key APP cleavage enzymes, ADAM10 and BACE1. Two neurotrophic factors in the GCM, nerve growth factor and fibroblast growth factor 2, are responsible for the up-regulation of ADAM10 and down-regulation of BACE1, respectively.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of NaHS, an H2S donor, in a triple transgenic AD mouse model (3×Tg-AD) under footshock with situational reminders (SRs). Inescapable footshock with SRs induced anxiety and cognitive dysfunction as well as a decrease in the levels of plasma H2S and GSH and an increase in IL-6 levels in 3×Tg-AD mice. Under footshock with SR stimulus, amyloid deposition, tau protein hyperphosphorylation, and microgliosis were highly increased in the stress-responsive brain structures, including the hippocampus and amygdala, of the AD mice. Oxidative stress, inflammatory response, and β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) levels were also increased, and the level of inactivated glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β) (pSer9) was decreased in the hippocampi of AD mice subjected to footshock with SRs. Furthermore, the numbers of cholinergic neurons in the medial septum/diagonal band of Broca (MS/DB) and noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC) were also decreased in the 3×Tg-AD mice under footshock with SRs. These biochemical hallmarks and pathological presentations were all alleviated by the semi-acute administration of NaHS in the AD mice. Together, these findings suggest that footshock with SRs induces the impairment of spatial cognition and emotion, which involve pathological changes in the peripheral and central systems, including the hippocampus, MS/DB, LC, and BLA, and that the administration of NaHS may be a candidate strategy to ameliorate the progression of neurodegeneration.

BACE1 is the primary enzyme in Aβ generation. Neuroinflammation potentially up-regulates BACE1 expression and increases Aβ production. In Alzheimer amyloid precursor protein-transgenic mice and SH-SY5Y cell models, we specifically knocked out or knocked down gene expression of mapk14, which encodes p38α MAPK, a kinase sensitive to inflammatory and oxidative stimuli. Using immunological and biochemical methods, we observed that reduction of p38α MAPK expression facilitated the lysosomal degradation of BACE1, decreased BACE1 protein and activity, and subsequently attenuated Aβ generation in the AD mouse brain. Inhibition of p38α MAPK also enhanced autophagy. Blocking autophagy by treating cells with 3-methyladenine or overexpressing dominant-negative ATG5 abolished the deficiency of the p38α MAPK-induced BACE1 protein reduction in cultured cells. Thus, our study demonstrates that p38α MAPK plays a critical role in the regulation of BACE1 degradation and Aβ generation in AD pathogenesis.

Therefore, we investigated whether there was an impaired peroxisomal β-oxidation and elevated VLCFA related to the increased Aβ in the diabetic brain. This study was conducted in a type 2 diabetic rat model induced by a high-fat diet and low-dose streptozotocin. A decrease in peroxisomal β-oxidation activity caused by down-regulated thiolase expression and a consequent increase in C26:0 were observed. Meanwhile, decreases in eicosapentenoic acid (EPA) and increases in oxidative stress [indicated by levels of malondialdehyde (MDA), and the protein expression of NOX4, p47(phox) and HO-1], Aβ, and the expression of AβPP and BACE1, two proteins involved in Aβ production, were observed.

Select members of the tetraspanin web were important both in the association between A10 and γ-secretase and the γ → α feedback mechanism.

In this study, we investigated the protective effects of saikosaponin C (SSc), one of the main bioactive components produced by the traditional Chinese herb, radix bupleuri, the root of Bupleurum falcatum, against AD in various neuronal models. Interestingly, we found that SSc has dual effects on AD by targeting amyloid beta (Aβ) and tau, two key proteins in AD. SSc significantly suppressed the release of both Aβ peptides 1-40 and 1-42 into cell culture supernatants, though it does not affect BACE1 activity and expression. SSc also inhibited abnormal tau phosphorylation at multiple AD-related residues. Moreover, SSc seems to have beneficial effects on cellular tau function; it accelerated nerve growth factor-mediated neurite outgrowth and increased the assembly of microtubules. In addition, SSc increased synaptic marker proteins such as synaptophysin and PSD-95. Considering its various biological activities, our results suggest that SSc might be a novel therapeutic tool for treating human AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. Tau and amyloid beta are two key features in Alzheimer's disease. Saikosaponin C, an active component of Bupleuri Radix, inhibits abnormal tau phosphorylation and amyloid beta production, thereby promoting synaptic integrity. Saikosaponin C also prevents amyloid beta-induced apoptosis in brain vascular endothelial cells. Therefore, Saikosaponin C may provide a new therapeutic strategy for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease.","1471-4159","Journal of neurochemistry","(136) 1232-1245",2016,"Tae Ho","Lee","TH","Division of Gerontology, Department of Medicine, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, USA."

Because aging is the most prominent risk factor for AD, understanding the molecular changes during aging is likely to provide critical insights into AD pathogenesis. However, studies on the role of miRNAs in aging and AD pathogenesis have only recently been initiated. Identifying miRNAs dysregulated by the aging process in the brain may lead to novel understanding of molecular mechanisms of AD pathogenesis. Here, we identified that miR-186 levels are gradually decreased in cortices of mouse brains during aging. In addition, we demonstrated that miR-186 suppresses β-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) expression by directly targeting the 3'UTR of Bace1 mRNA in neuronal cells. In contrast, inhibition of endogenous miR-186 significantly increased BACE1 levels in neuronal cells. Importantly, miR-186 over-expression significantly decreased Aβ level by suppressing BACE1 expression in cells expressing human pathogenic mutant amyloid precursor protein. Taken together, our data demonstrate that miR-186 is a potent negative regulator of BACE1 in neuronal cells and it may be one of the molecular links between brain aging and the increased risk for AD during aging. We identified that miR-186 levels are gradually decreased in mouse cortices during aging. Furthermore, we demonstrated that miR-186 is a novel negative regulator of beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) expression in neuronal cells.

However, oligonol exhibited only marginal concentration-dependent BACE1 inhibitory activity with an IC50 value of 130.45 µg/mL. A kinetics study revealed mixed-type inhibition against AChE (K i = 4.65) and BACE1 (K i = 58.80), and noncompetitive-type inhibition against BChE (K i = 9.80). Furthermore, oligonol exhibited dose-dependent inhibitory activity against peroxynitrite (ONOO(-))-mediated protein tyrosine nitration. These results indicate that oligonol has strong preventative potential in diabetes mellitus and in Alzheimer's disease.","1976-3786","Archives of pharmacal research","(39) 409-20",2016,"Jae Sue","Choi","JS","Department of Food and Life Science, Pukyong National University, Busan, 608-737, Republic of Korea. choijs@pknu.ac.kr."

Preclinical AD refers to the stages that exhibit amyloid deposition in the brain but have normal cognitive function, which are replicated in young adult APPswe/PS1deltaE9 (deltaE9) mice. By long-term in vivo two-photon microscopy, we demonstrate impaired adaptive spine plasticity in these transgenic mice illustrated by their failure to increase dendritic spine density and form novel neural connections when housed in enriched environment (EE). Decrease of amyloid plaques by reducing BACE1 activity restores the gain of spine density upon EE in deltaE9 mice, but not the remodeling of neural networks. On the other hand, anti-inflammatory treatment with pioglitazone or interleukin 1 receptor antagonist in deltaE9 mice successfully rescues the impairments in increasing spine density and remodeling of neural networks during EE. Our data suggest that neuroinflammation disrupts experience-dependent structural plasticity of dendritic spines in preclinical stages of AD.

However, the exact relationship between BACE1 and PHF (Paired Helical Filaments) formation is not clear. In this study, we confirm that BACE1 and Hsc70 are upregulated in the brains of AD patients, and we demonstrate that both proteins show enhanced expression in lipid rafts from AD-affected triple transgenic mouse brains. BACE1 targeting increased Hsc70 levels in the membrane and cytoplasm fractions and downregulated Hsp90 and CHIP in the nucleus in the hippocampi of 3xTg-AD mice. However, these observations occurred in a proteasome-independent manner in vitro. The BACE1miR-induced reduction of soluble hyperphosphorylated tau was associated with a decrease in MAPK activity. However, the BACE1 RNAi-mediated reduction of hyperphosphorylated tau was only blocked by 3-MA (3-methyladenine) in vitro, and it resulted in the increase of Hsc70 and LAMP2 in lipid rafts from hippocampi of 3xTg-AD mice, and upregulation of survival and homeostasis signaling. In summary, our findings suggest that BACE1 silencing neuroprotects reducing soluble hyperphosphorylated tau, modulating certain autophagy-related proteins in aged 3xTg-AD mice.

Seven alkaloids out of fifteen were found to be active, with (-)-corycavamine (3) and (+)-corynoline (5) demonstrating the highest BACE1 inhibition activity, in the micromolar range, in a concentration dependent manner. BACE1-IMER was found to be a valid device for the fast screening of inhibitors and the determination of their potency. In a permeation assay (PAMPA) for the prediction of blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration, the most active compounds, (-)-corycavamine (3) and (+)-corynoline (5), were found to be able to cross the BBB. Not all compounds showed activity against glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK-3β) and casein kinase-1δ (CK-1δ).

However, the mechanisms of OCSC proliferation and invasion are not clear. Recent studies suggest that anisomycin can inhibit the proliferative and invasive ability of various tumor cells by increasing the production of the toxic amyloid β (Aβ1-42) peptides from the amyloid precursor protein (APP). We explored whether anisomycin could also suppress human OCSC proliferation and invasion. The CD44+/CD117+ OCSCs were enriched from human clinical ovarian tumor tissues. OCSCs treated with anisomycin showed reduced proliferation compared to controls. Moreover, anisomycin significantly suppressed the invasive capacity of OCSCs in vitro, as indicated by cell migration assays. The mRNA expression levels of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 antisense strand (BACE1-AS) were significantly increased in anisomycin-treated OCSCs compared to controls. In addition, mRNA and protein levels of BACE1 and Aβ1-42 were increased in anisomycin-treated OCSCs compared to controls. We confirmed that anisomycin suppressed the growth of xenograft tumors formed by OCSCs in vivo. Finally, when expression of lncRNA BACE1-AS was silenced using siRNA, BACE1 expression was downregulated and the antiproliferative and anti-invasive effects of anisomycin were reduced. Overall, we identified lncRNA BACE1-AS as a novel target for anisomycin.

Methods. The aim of this study was to investigate whether candidate polymorphisms in five genes (ADAM10, BACE1, BACE2, PSEN2, and CLU) involved in the APP processing pathway affect PD risk in a population-based cohort of patients with incident PD and control subjects from the Norwegian ParkWest study.

However, their enzymatic properties are different, which leads to different clinical outcomes. In this study, we performed sequence analysis and all-atom molecular dynamic (MD) simulations for both enzymes in their ligand-free states in order to compare their dynamical flap behaviors. This is to enhance our understanding of the relationship between sequence, structure and the dynamics of this protein family. Sequence analysis shows that in BACE1 and BACE2, most of the ligand-binding sites are conserved, indicative of their enzymatic property as aspartyl protease members. The other conserved residues are more or less unsystematically localized throughout the structure. Herein, we proposed and applied different combined parameters to define the asymmetric flap motion; the distance, d1, between the flap tip and the flexible region; the dihedral angle, φ, to account for the twisting motion and the TriCα angle, θ2 and θ1. All four combined parameters were found to appropriately define the observed ""twisting"" motion during the flaps different conformational states. Additional analysis of the parameters indicated that the flaps can exist in an ensemble of conformations, i.e. closed, semi-open and open conformations for both systems. However, the behavior of the flap tips during simulations is different between BACE1 and BACE2. The BACE1 active site cavity is more spacious as compared to that of BACE2. The analysis of 10S loop and 113S loop showed a similar trend to that of flaps, with the BACE1 loops being more flexible and less stable than those of BACE2. We believe that the results, methods and perspectives highlighted in this report would assist researchers in the discovery of BACE inhibitors as potential Alzheimer's disease therapies.

An antibody targeting transferrin receptor (TfR) has been shown to take advantage of the receptor-mediated transcytosis properties of TfR in order to cross the BBB in mice, with the uptake in the brain being dependent on the affinity to TfR. In the bispecific format with arms targeting both TfR and β-secretase 1 (BACE1), altering the affinity to TfR has been shown to impact systemic exposure and safety profiles. In this work, a mathematical model incorporating pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PKPD) and safety profiles is developed for bispecific TfR/BACE1 antibodies with a range of affinities to TfR in order to guide candidate selection. The model captures the dependence of both systemic and brain exposure on TfR affinity and the subsequent impact on brain Aβ40 lowering and circulating reticulocyte levels. Model simulations identify the optimal affinity for the TfR arm of the bispecific to maximize Aβ reduction while maintaining reticulocyte levels. The model serves as a useful tool to prioritize and optimize preclinical studies and has been used to support the selection of additional candidates for further development.

26824018,"Physical evidence supporting a ribosomal shunting mechanism of translation initiation for BACE1 mRNA.","In Alzheimer disease, elevated levels of the BACE1 enzyme are correlated with increased production of amyloid peptides and disease pathology. The increase in BACE1 levels is post-transcriptional and may involve altered translation efficiency. Earlier studies have indicated that translation of BACE1 mRNA is cap-dependent. As ribosomal subunits move from the cap-structure to the initiation codon, they fail to recognize several AUG codons in the 5' leader. In this study, we looked for physical evidence of the mechanism underlying ribosomal scanning or shunting along the BACE1 5' leader by investigating structural stability in the 5' leaders of endogenous mRNAs in vivo. To perform this analysis, we probed RNAs using lead(II) acetate, a cell-permeable chemical that induces cleavage of unpaired nucleotides having conformational flexibility. The data revealed that the ≈440-nt 5' leader was generally resistant to cleavage except for a region upstream of the initiation codon. Cleavage continued into the coding region, consistent with destabilization of secondary structures by translating ribosomes. Evidence that a large segment of the BACE1 5' leader was not cleaved indicates that this region is structurally stable and suggests that it is not scanned. The data support a mechanism of translation initiation in which ribosomal subunits bypass (shunt) part of the BACE1 5' leader to reach the initiation codon. We suggest that a nucleotide bias in the 5' leader may predispose the initiation codon to be more accessible than other AUG codons in the 5' leader, leading to an increase in its relative utilization.

In our ongoing research aimed at identifying anti-AD remedies derived from maritime plants, we evaluated the BACE1 inhibitory activities of fucosterol and fucoxanthin from Ecklonia stolonifera and Undaria pinnatifida. In vitro anti-AD activities were performed via BACE1 inhibition assays, as well as enzyme kinetic and molecular docking predictions. Based on enzyme-based assays, fucosterol and fucoxanthin showed noncompetitive and mixed-type inhibition, respectively, against BACE1. In addition, docking simulation results demonstrated that the Lys224 residue of BACE1 interacted with one hydroxyl group of fucosterol, while two additional BACE1 residues (Gly11 and Ala127) interacted with two hydroxyl groups of fucoxanthin. Moreover, the binding energy of fucosterol and fucoxanthin was negative (-10.1 and -7.0 kcal/mol), indicating that hydrogen bonding may stabilize the open form of the enzyme and potentiate tight binding of the active site of BACE1, resulting in more effective BACE1 inhibition. The results suggest that fucosterol and fucoxanthin may be used beneficially in the treatment of AD and provide potential guidelines for the design of new BACE1 inhibitors.

Here we present a systems pharmacology model describing the changes in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) pathway after administration of three different doses (10, 30, and 125 mg/kg) of the β-secretase 1 (BACE1) inhibitor MBi-5 in cisterna magna ported rhesus monkeys. The time course of the MBi-5 concentration in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was analyzed in conjunction with the effect on the concentrations of the APP metabolites Aβ42, Aβ40, soluble β-amyloid precursor protein (sAPP) α, and sAPPβ in CSF. The systems pharmacology model contained expressions to describe the production, elimination, and brain-to-CSF transport for the APP metabolites. Upon administration of MBi-5, a dose-dependent increase of the metabolite sAPPα and dose-dependent decreases of sAPPβ and Aβ were observed. Maximal inhibition of BACE1 was close to 100% and the IC50 value was 0.0256 μM (95% confidence interval, 0.0137-0.0375). A differential effect of BACE1 inhibition on Aβ40 and Aβ42 was observed, with the Aβ40 response being larger than the Aβ42 response. This enabled the identification of an Aβ42 oligomer pool in the systems pharmacology model. These findings indicate that decreases in monomeric Aβ responses resulting from BACE1 inhibition are partially compensated by dissociation of Aβ oligomers and suggest that BACE1 inhibition may also reduce the putatively neurotoxic oligomer pool.

Candidate bioactive compounds responsible for the effects were quantified using HPLC-DAD.

Herein, we aimed to investigate the possible impacts of atorvastatin (10 mg/kg, p.o.) on the memory deficit by behavioral tests and changes of AKT/GSK3β signaling in hippocampus and prefrontal cortex by western blot test in Tg APP/PS1 mice. The results showed that treatment with atorvastatin significantly reversed the memory deficit in the Tg APP/PS1 mice in a novel object recognition and the Morris water maze tests. Moreover, atorvastatin significantly attenuated Aβ1-42 accumulation and phosphorylation of tau (Ser396) in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of Tg APP/PS1 mice. In addition, atorvastatin treatment also increased phosphorylation of AKT, inhibited GSK3β activity by increasing phosphorylation of GSK3β (Ser9) and decreasing the beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) expression.

Here, we report the in vitro and in vivo pharmacological profile of AZD3293, a potent, highly permeable, orally active, blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetrating, BACE1 inhibitor with unique slow off-rate kinetics.

The in vitro potency of AZD3293 in mouse and guinea pig primary cortical neuronal cells was correlated to the in vivo potency expressed as free AZD3293 concentrations in mouse and guinea pig brains. In mice and dogs, the slow off-rate from BACE1 may have translated into a prolongation of the observed effect beyond the turnover rate of Aβ.

Drug-likeness assay including Lipinski's rule of five and ADMET properties filters were further used to identify BACE1 inhibitor. Finally, 13 compounds with novel scaffolds were selected and, considering of the nature of relative high LogP value of many marketed AD drugs, three of them with top 3 predicted LogP value were evaluated for their IC50 values in vitro by BACE1 enzymatic activity study. We believe that compound 13 with an IC50 value of 136 µM can be a lead compound with great potential in BACE1 inhibition and increasing activity by subsequently structure modification or optimization. At the same time, we found that the interaction between the residues Asp228, Asp32 of BACE1 and ligands is significant through analyzing the binding mode of 13 candidate compounds.

However, the intricate pH dependence of BACE1 function and inhibitor efficacy has posed major challenges for structure-based drug design. Here we investigate two structurally similar BACE1 inhibitors that have dramatically different inhibitory activity using continuous constant pH molecular dynamics (CpHMD). At high pH, both inhibitors are stably bound to BACE1; however, within the enzyme active pH range, only the iminopyrimidinone-based inhibitor remains bound, while the aminothiazine-based inhibitor becomes partially dissociated following the loss of hydrogen bonding with the active site and change of the 10s loop conformation. The drastically lower activity of the second inhibitor is due to the protonation of a catalytic aspartate and the lack of a propyne tail. This work demonstrates that CpHMD can be used for screening pH-dependent binding profiles of small-molecule inhibitors, providing a new tool for structure-based drug design and optimization.

While processing and trafficking of APP has been extensively studied in non-neuronal cells, the fate of APP at neuronal synapses and in response to reduced BACE1 activity has not been fully elucidated. Here we examined the consequence of reduced BACE1 activity on endogenous synaptic APP by monitoring N- and C-terminal APP epitopes by immunocytochemistry. In control rodent primary hippocampal neuron cultures, labeling with antibodies directed to N-terminal APP epitopes showed a significant overlap with synaptic vesicle markers (SV2 or synaptotagmin). In contrast, labeling with antibodies directed to C-terminal epitopes of APP showed only a limited overlap with these proteins. In neurons derived from BACE1-deficient mice, and in control neurons treated with a BACE1 inhibitor, both the N-terminal and the C-terminal APP labeling overlapped significantly with synaptic vesicle markers. Moreover, BACE1 inhibition increased the proximity between the APP C-terminus and SV2 as shown by a proximity ligation assay. These results, together with biochemical observations, indicate that BACE1 can regulate the levels of full-length APP at neuronal synapses.

Pigment cell-specific MELanocyte Protein (PMEL17) plays a crucial role in melanogenesis. One of the critical steps is the amyloid-like functional oligomerization of PMEL17. Beta Site APP Cleaving Enzyme-2 (BACE2) and γ-secretase have been shown to be key players in generating the proteolytic fragments of PMEL17. The β-secretase (BACE1) is responsible for the generation of amyloid-β (Aβ) fragments in the brain and is therefore proposed as a therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Currently BACE1 inhibitors, most of which lack selectivity over BACE2, have demonstrated efficacious reduction of amyloid-β peptides in animals and the CSF of humans. BACE2 knock-out mice have a deficiency in PMEL17 proteolytic processing leading to impaired melanin storage and hair depigmentation. Here, we confirm BACE2-mediated inhibition of PMEL17 proteolytic processing in vitro in mouse and human melanocytes. Furthermore, we show that wildtype as well as bace2(+/-) and bace2(-/-) mice treated with a potent dual BACE1/BACE2 inhibitor NB-360 display dose-dependent appearance of irreversibly depigmented hair.

The resultant optimal comparative molecular similarity indices analysis (CoMSIA) model displays strong predictability (Q(2) = 0.503, Rncv(2) = 0.854, Rpre(2) = 0.905). Docking and MD simulations demonstrate that these HEAs bind to BACE1 in a site which occupies the S1, S1' and S2' pockets, with a ""mantodea"" conformation that is mainly stabilized by the H-bond interactions. Moreover, the structural determinants of these HEA analogues are as follows: (1) the P2' region is sensitive to the steric bulk; (2) the atom at the 2-position of the five-membered heterocyclic group (ring A) as an H-bond acceptor is conducive to the hydrogen bonding interaction, while the atom at the 6-position is detrimental; (3) introduction of the H-bond acceptor and/or donor groups into the P1' region is crucial to the inhibitory potency improvement. These models and the derived information may help provide a better understanding of both the binding mode and specific interactions of HEA-based BACE1 inhibitors, and facilitate corresponding lead optimization and novel inhibitor design.

We show that partial BACE1 genetic reduction prevents these AD-related pathological features in the Ts2 mouse model of Down syndrome. Partially reducing BACE1 by deleting one BACE1 allele blocked development of age-related endosome enlargement in the medial septal nucleus, cerebral cortex, and hippocampus and loss of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)-positive medial septal nucleus neurons. BACE1 reduction normalized APP-βCTF elevation but did not alter Aβ40 and Aβ42 peptide levels in brain, supporting a critical role in vivo for APP-βCTF in the development of these abnormalities. Although ameliorative effects of BACE1 inhibition on β-amyloidosis and synaptic proteins levels have been previously noted in AD mouse models, our results highlight the additional potential value of BACE1 modulation in therapeutic targeting of endocytic dysfunction and cholinergic neurodegeneration in Down syndrome and AD.

However, exogenous delivery of siRNA restricts their transport into different tissues and specifically into the brain mainly due to its large size and the presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB). To overcome these challenges, we developed here a strategy wherein a peptide known to target specific gangliosides was fused to a double-stranded RNA binding protein to deliver siRNA to the brain parenchyma. The designed fusion protein designated as TARBP-BTP consists of a double-stranded RNA-binding domain (dsRBD) of human Trans Activation response element (TAR) RNA Binding Protein (TARBP2) fused to a brain targeting peptide that binds to monosialoganglioside GM1. Conformation-specific binding of TARBP2 domain to siRNA led to the formation of homogenous serum-stable complex with targeting potential. Further, uptake of the complex in Neuro-2a, IMR32 and HepG2 cells analyzed by confocal microscopy and fluorescence activated cell sorting, revealed selective requirement of GM1 for entry. Remarkably, systemic delivery of the fluorescently labeled complex (TARBP-BTP:siRNA) in ΑβPP-PS1 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) led to distinctive localization in the cerebral hemisphere. Further, the delivery of siRNA mediated by TARBP-BTP led to significant knockdown of BACE1 in the brain, in both ΑβPP-PS1 mice and wild type C57BL/6.

Morris water maze (MWM) test was conducted to test the ability of cognitive and memory. The level of OS was detected by superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and glutathione (GSH) content.

OS of hippocampal neuron was detected. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay showed that the content of Aβ protein and its oligomers in EMP-exposed rats were higher than that of sham-exposed rats. The content of Beta Site App Cleaving Enzyme (BACE1) and microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3-II (LC3-II) in EMP-exposed rats hippocampus were also higher than that of sham-exposed rats. SOD activity and GSH content in EMP-exposed rats were lower than sham-exposed rats (p<0.05). Several mechanisms were proposed based on EMP exposure-induced OS, including increased amyloid precursor protein (APP) aberrant cleavage.

Meanwhile, Aβ could further enhance the expression of BACE1 protein due to the inhibition of miR-124. Thus, miR-124 was the key factor in this hypoxia/Aβ-miR-124-BACE1-Aβ cycle. The activation of EPAC-Rap1 pathway was involved in the inhibition of miR-124 in hippocampus under hypoxia or Aβ insult.

However, the mechanisms by which Gas suppresses BACE1 expression are not clear. Morris water maze test was performed to assess the effect of Gas treatment on memory impairments in Tg2576 mice. The level of oxidative stress in the brain of Tg2576 mice was determined by measuring the superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, catalase (CAT) activity, and the levels of malondialdehyde (MDA) and ROS.

The cellular and molecular mechanisms that govern presynaptic dystrophic neurite formation are unclear, and elucidating these processes may lead to novel AD therapeutic strategies. Previous studies suggest Aβ may disrupt microtubules, which we hypothesize have a critical role in the development of presynaptic dystrophies. To investigate this further, here we have assessed the effects of Aβ, particularly neurotoxic Aβ42, on microtubules during the formation of presynaptic dystrophic neurites in vitro and in vivo. Live-cell imaging of primary neurons revealed that exposure to Aβ42 oligomers caused varicose and beaded neurites with extensive microtubule disruption, and inhibited anterograde and retrograde trafficking. In brain sections from AD patients and the 5XFAD transgenic mouse model of amyloid pathology, dystrophic neurite halos with BACE1 elevation around amyloid plaques exhibited aberrant tubulin accumulations or voids. At the ultrastructural level, peri-plaque dystrophies were strikingly devoid of microtubules and replete with multi-lamellar vesicles resembling autophagic intermediates. Proteins of the microtubule motors, kinesin and dynein, and other neuronal proteins were aberrantly localized in peri-plaque dystrophies. Inactive pro-cathepsin D also accumulated in peri-plaque dystrophies, indicating reduced lysosomal function. Most importantly, BACE1 accumulation in peri-plaque dystrophies caused increased BACE1 cleavage of APP and Aβ generation. Our study supports the hypothesis that Aβ induces microtubule disruption in presynaptic dystrophic neurites that surround plaques, thus impairing axonal transport and leading to accumulation of BACE1 and exacerbation of amyloid pathology in AD.","1432-0533","Acta neuropathologica","(132) 235-256",2016,"Katherine R","Sadleir","KR","Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, 60611, USA."

Immunohistochemical staining was performed to analyze the distribution of Aβ plaques in the APP/PS1 mouse brain. The levels of Aβ were determined using ELISA kits. AS-IV was shown to be a PPARγ agonist by establishing a high-throughput screening model for PPARγ agonists. The results showed that AS-IV treatment increased activity of PPARγ and inhibited BACE1 in vitro. As a result, Aβ levels decreased significantly. GW9662, which is a PPARγ antagonist, significantly blocked the beneficial role of AS-IV. In vivo, AS-IV treatment increased PPARγ and BACE1 expression and reduced neuritic plaque formation and Aβ levels in the brains of APP/PS1 mice. These effects of AS-IV could be effectively inhibited by GW9662. These results indicate that AS-IV may be a natural PPARγ agonist that suppressed activity of BACE1 and ultimately attenuates generation of Aβ.

TLS at dose of 200 mg/kg significantly restored the activities of total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), as well as the level of malondialdehyde (MDA) both in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex in mice. Results of histopathological examination indicated that TLS noticeably ameliorated the neurodegeneration in the hippocampus in mice. On the other hand, TLS (100 μM) could protect the Aβ1-42-induced primary mouse neuronal cells by blocking the decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), change the expressions of Bcl-2 (important regulator in the mitochondria apoptosis pathway). Moreover, TLS also decreased the activity of β-secretase 1 (BACE1), crucial protease contributes to the hydrolysis of amyloid precursor protein (APP), and inhibited the expression of JKN/p38, which involved in the MAPKs signaling pathways in both mice and primary mouse neuronal cells. In summary, TLS might protect against cognitive deficits and neurodegeneration by releasing the damage of oxidative stress, inhibiting the expression of BACE1 and the MAPKs inflammatory signaling pathways.

27044452,"Inhibiting BACE1 to reverse synaptic dysfunctions in Alzheimer's disease.","Over the past two decades, many studies have identified significant contributions of toxic β-amyloid peptides (Aβ) to the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is the most common age-dependent neurodegenerative disease. AD is also recognized as a disease of synaptic failure. Aβ, generated by sequential proteolytic cleavages of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by BACE1 and γ-secretase, is one of major culprits that cause this failure. In this review, we summarize current findings on how BACE1-cleaved APP products impact learning and memory through proteins localized on glutamatergic, GABAergic, and dopaminergic synapses. Considering the broad effects of Aβ on all three types of synapses, BACE1 inhibition emerges as a practical approach for ameliorating Aβ-mediated synaptic dysfunctions. Since BACE1 inhibitory drugs are currently in clinical trials, this review also discusses potential complications arising from BACE1 inhibition. We emphasize that the benefits of BACE1 inhibitory drugs will outweigh the concerns.","1873-7528","Neuroscience and biobehavioral reviews","(65) 326-40",2016,"Riqiang","Yan","R","Department of Neurosciences, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA.

Currently, there are no available therapies to delay or block the disease progression. Thus, the disease-modifying therapies are urgent for this devastating disorder by simultaneously targeting multiple distinct pathological processes. Morin, a natural bioflavonoid, have been shown to be strongly neuroprotective in vitro and in vivo. In this study, we first investigated the disease-modifying effects of chronic morin administration on the neuropathological and cognitive impairments in APPswe/PS1dE9 double transgenic mice. Our results showed that chronic morin administration prevented spatial learning and memory deficits in the APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. Morin treatment in the APPswe/PS1dE9 mice markedly reduced cerebral Aβ production and Aβ plaque burden via promoting non-amyloidogenic APP processing pathway by increasing ADAM10 expression, inhibiting amyloidogenic APP processing pathway by decreased BACE1 and PS1 expression, and facilitating Aβ degradation by enhancing Aβ-degrading enzyme expression. In addition, we also found that morin treatment in the APPswe/PS1dE9 mice markedly decreased tau hyperphosphorylation via its inhibitory effect on CDK5 signal pathway. Furthermore, morin treatment in the APPswe/PS1dE9 mice markedly reduced the activated glial cells and increased the expression of synaptic markers. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that chronic morin treatment restores cognitive functions and reverses multiple distinct neuropathological AD-like hallmarks in the APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. This study provides novel insights into the neuroprotective actions and neurobiological mechanisms of morin against AD, suggesting that morin is a potently promising disease-modifying agent for treatment of AD.","1873-7064","Neuropharmacology","(108) 1-13",2016,"Ying","Du","Y","Department of Neurology, Tangdu Hospital, Fourth Military Medical University, Xi'an City, Shaanxi Province 710038, China."

Involvement of several pathogenic events and their interconnections make this disease a complex disorder. Therefore, designing compounds that can inhibit multiple toxic pathways is the most attractive therapeutic strategy in complex disorders like AD. Here, we have designed a multi-tier screening protocol combining ensemble docking to mine BACE1 inhibitor, as well as 2-D QSAR models for anti-amyloidogenic and antioxidant activities. An in house developed phytochemical library of 200 phytochemicals has been screened through this multi-target procedure which mine hesperidin, a flavanone glycoside commonly found in citrus food items, as a multi-potent phytochemical in AD therapeutics. Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy reveal that binding of hesperidin to the active site of BACE1 induces a conformational transition of the protein from open to closed form. Hesperidin docks close to the catalytic aspartate residues and orients itself in a way that blocks the cavity opening thereby precluding substrate binding. Hesperidin is a high affinity BACE1 inhibitor and only 500 nM of the compound shows complete inhibition of the enzyme activity. Furthermore, ANS and Thioflavin-T binding assay show that hesperidin completely inhibits the amyloid fibril formation which is further supported by atomic force microscopy. Hesperidin exhibits moderate ABTS(+) radical scavenging assay but strong hydroxyl radical scavenging ability, as evident from DNA nicking assay. Present study demonstrates the applicability of a novel multi-target screening procedure to mine multi-potent agents from natural origin for AD therapeutics.

However, whether the Sp1 activation plays a critical role in the AD pathogenesis and selective inhibition of Sp1 activation may have a disease-modifying effect on the AD-like phenotypes remain elusive. In this study, we reported that Sp1 mRNA and protein expression were markedly increased in the brain of APPswe/PS1dE9 transgenic mice, whereas chronic administration of mithramycin A (MTM), a selective Sp1 inhibitor, potently inhibited Sp1 activation in the APPswe/PS1dE9 mice down to the levels of wild-type mice. Specifically, we found that MTM treatment resulted in a significant improvement of learning and memory deficits, a dramatic reduction in cerebral Aβ levels and plaque burden, a profound reduction in tau hyperphosphorylation, and a marked increase in synaptic marker in the APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. In addition, MTM treatment was powerfully effective in inhibiting amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing via suppressing APP, beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), and presenilin-1 (PS1) mRNA and protein expression to preclude Aβ production in the APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. Furthermore, MTM treatment strongly inhibited phosphorylated CDK5 and GSK3β signal pathways to reduce tau hyperphosphorylation in the APPswe/PS1dE9 mice.

Previously, we observed that injured peripheral nerves from Beta-site APP Cleaving Enzyme 1 (BACE1) knockout (KO) mice displayed earlier influx of and enhanced phagocytosis by macrophages when compared to wild-type (WT) mice. These observations suggest that BACE1 might regulate macrophage influx into distal stumps of injured nerves. To determine through which pathway BACE1 influences macrophage influx, we used a mouse inflammation antibody array to assay the expression of inflammation-related proteins in injured nerves of BACE1 KO and WT mice. The most significant change was in expression of tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) in the distal stump of injured BACE1 KO nerves. Western blotting of protein extracts confirmed increased expression of TNFR1 and its downstream transcriptional factor NFκB in the BACE1 KO distal stumps. Additionally, treatment of WT mice with a BACE1 inhibitor resulted in increased TNFR1 expression and signaling in the distal stump of injured nerves. Exogenous TNFα increased nuclear translocation of p65 NFκB in BACE1 KO tissue and cultured fibroblasts compared with control WT. BACE1 regulates TNFR1 expression at the level of gene expression and not through proteolytic processing. The accelerated macrophage influx in injured nerves of BACE1 KO mice correlates with increased expression and signaling via TNFR1, indicating a link between BACE1 activity and TNFR1 expression/signaling that might contribute to repair of the injured nervous system.","1095-953X","Neurobiology of disease","(93) 21-7",2016,"Lijuan","Liu","L","Department of Neurology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, United States."

A central step in the generation of toxic amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides is the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β-site APP-cleaving enzyme (BACE1). Here, we have elucidated whether downregulation of septin (SEPT) protein family members, which are implicated in synaptic plasticity and vesicular trafficking, affects APP processing and Aβ generation. SEPT8 was found to reduce soluble APPβ and Aβ levels in neuronal cells through a post-translational mechanism leading to decreased levels of BACE1 protein. In the human temporal cortex, we identified alterations in the expression of specific SEPT8 transcript variants in a manner that correlated with Alzheimer's-disease-related neurofibrillary pathology. These changes were associated with altered β-secretase activity. We also discovered that the overexpression of a specific Alzheimer's-disease-associated SEPT8 transcript variant increased the levels of BACE1 and Aβ peptides in neuronal cells. These changes were related to an increased half-life of BACE1 and the localization of BACE1 in recycling endosomes. These data suggest that SEPT8 modulates β-amyloidogenic processing of APP through a mechanism affecting the intracellular sorting and accumulation of BACE1.","1477-9137","Journal of cell science","(129) 2224-38",2016,"Kaisa M A","Kurkinen","KM","Institute of Biomedicine, School of Medicine, University of Eastern Finland, 70211 Kuopio, Finland."

Elucidation of the regulatory pathways of BACE1 is critical, not only for understanding the pathological mechanisms of AD but also developing effective therapeutic strategies to inhibit activity of the protease.

27094468,"Behaviour and cognitive changes correlated with hippocampal neuroinflammaging and neuronal markers in female SAMP8, a model of accelerated senescence.","Senescence accelerated mice P8 (SAMP8) is a phenotypic model of age, characterized by deficits in memory and altered behaviour. Here, we determined the effect of age in SAMP8, and compared with the resistant strain, SAMR1, in behaviour and learning parameters linking these disturbances with oxidative stress environment. We found impairment in emotional behaviour with regard to fear and anxiety in young SAMP8 vs. age-mated SAMR1. Differences were attenuated with age. In contrast, learning capabilities are worse in SAMP8, both in young and aged animals, with regard to SAMR1. These waves in behaviour and cognition were correlated with an excess of oxidative stress (OS) in SAMP8 at younger ages that diminished with age. In this manner, we found changes in the hippocampal expression of ALDH2, IL-6, HMOX1, COX2, CXCL10, iNOS, and MCP-1 with an altered amyloidogenic pathway by increasing the Amyloid beta precursor protein (APP) and BACE1, and reduced ADAM10 expression; in addition, astrogliosis and neuronal markers decreased. Moreover, Superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) and Nuclear factor-kappa beta (NF-kβ) expression and protein levels were higher in younger SAMP8 than in SAMR1. In conclusion, the accelerated senescence process present in SAMP8 can be linked with an initial deregulation in redox homeostasis, named neuroinflammaging, by inducing molecular changes that lead to neuroinflammation and the neurodegenerative process. These changes are reflected in the emotional and cognitive behaviour of SAMP8 that differs from that of SAMR1 and that highlighted the importance of earlier oxidative processes in the onset of neurodegeneration.","1873-6815","Experimental gerontology","(80) 57-69",2016,"Christian","Griñan-Ferré","C","Department of Pharmacology and Therapeutic Chemistry, Institute of Neuroscience, University of Barcelona, Avda.

Therefore, it is crucial to identify novel biomarkers for the presymptomatic diagnosis of AD. While brain lesions are a major feature of AD, retinal pathological changes also occur in patients. In this study, we investigated the temporal changes in β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) expression in the retina and brain to determine whether it could serve as a suitable biomarker for early monitoring of AD. APP/PS-1 transgenic mice, 3, 6 and 8 months of age, were used as an experimental group, and age-matched C57/BL6 wild-type mice served as the control group. In the Morris water maze test, there were no significant differences in escape latency or in the number of crossings in the target area among mice of different ages. Compared with wild-type mice, no changes in learning or memory abilities were detected in transgenic mice at 3 months of age. However, compared with wild-type mice, the escape latency was significantly increased in transgenic mice at 6 months, starting on day 3, and at 8 months, starting on day 2, during Morris water maze training. In addition, the number of crossings of the target area was significantly decreased in transgenic mice. The learning and memory abilities of transgenic mice were further worsened at 8 months of age. Immunohistochemical staining revealed no BACE1 plaques in wild-type mice at 3, 6 or 8 months or in transgenic mice at 3 months, but they were clearly found in the entorhinal cortex, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex of transgenic mice at 6 and 8 months. BACE1 expression was not detected in the retina of wild-type mice at 3 months, but weak BACE1 expression was detected in the ganglion cell layer, inner plexiform layer and outer plexiform layer at 6 and 8 months. In transgenic mice, BACE1 expression in the ganglion cell layer was increased at 3 months, and BACE1 expression in the ganglion cell layer, inner plexiform layer and outer plexiform layer was significantly increased at 6 and 8 months, compared with age-matched wild-type mice. Taken together, these results indicate that changes in BACE1 expression appear earlier in the retina than in the brain and precede behavioral deficits. Our findings suggest that abnormal expression of BACE1 in the retina is an early pathological change in APP/PS-1 transgenic mice, and that BACE1 might have potential as a biomarker for the early diagnosis of AD in humans.

Nevertheless, presently, few studies have been involved in the learning and memory impairments, as well as neuropathology elicited by the chronic prenatal stress (CPS) and the chronic offspring stress (COS) exposures simultaneously, particularly for the adult male APPswe/PS1dE9 murine offspring. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of CPS on learning and memory impairments induced by COS in 6-month-old male APPswe/PS1dE9 offspring mice and the related mechanism. Our study firstly demonstrates that 14-day exposure to CPS could exacerbate the learning and memory impairments, as well as neuropathological damages in the CA3 regions of the hippocampus and cortex neurons, which is induced by the 28-day exposure to COS in 6-month-old male APPswe/PS1dE9 offspring mice. In addition, CPS could potentiate the production of AβPP, Aβ42, and corticosterone in 6-month-old male APPswe/PS1dE9 offspring that also suffer COS. In conclusion, our novel findings strongly implicate the synergistic roles of the CPS and COS exposures in impairing offspring learning and memory.

Therefore, identifying the functional significance of glycans is crucial for developing an understanding of cell signaling and subsequent physiological and pathological cellular events. In particular, the function of N-glycans associated with cell surface receptors has been extensively studied since they are directly involved in controlling cellular functions. In this review, we focus on the roles of glycosyltransferases that are involved in the modification of N-glycans and their target proteins such as epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), ErbB3, transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) receptor, T-cell receptors (TCR), β-site APP cleaving enzyme (BACE1), glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2), E-cadherin, and α5β1 integrin in relation to diseases and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process. Above of those proteins are subjected to being modified by several glycosyltransferases such as N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase III (GnT-III), N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase IV (GnT-IV), N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase V (GnT-V), α2,6 sialyltransferase 1 (ST6GAL1), and α1,6 fucosyltransferase (Fut8), which are typical N-glycan branching enzymes and play pivotal roles in regulating the function of cell surface receptors in pathological cell signaling.","1872-9452","Molecular aspects of medicine","(51) 56-70",2016,"Motoko","Takahashi","M","Department of Biochemistry, Sapporo Medical University School of Medicine, South-1 West-17, Chuo-ku, Sapporo 060-8556, Japan."

We found that osthole treatment significantly up-regulate miR-107 expression and inhibited BACE1, one of the targets of miR-107. Administration of osthole to APP/PS1 transgenic mice resulted in a significant improvement in learning and memory function, which was associated with a significant a decrease in Aβ in the hippocampal and cortex region of the brain.

Our previous studies have shown that BACE1 is degraded via the lysosomal pathway and that depletion of GGA3 results in increased BACE1 levels and activity owing to impaired lysosomal trafficking and degradation. We further demonstrated the role of GGA3 in the regulation of BACE1 in vivo by showing that BACE1 levels are increased in the brain of GGA3 null mice. We report here that GGA3 deletion results in novelty-induced hyperactivity and decreased anxiety-like behaviors. Given the pivotal role of GABAergic transmission in the regulation of anxiety-like behaviors, we performed electrophysiological recordings in hippocampal slices and found increased phasic and decreased tonic inhibition in the dentate gyrus granule cells (DGGC). Moreover, we found that the number of inhibitory synapses is increased in the dentate gyrus of GGA3 null mice in further support of the electrophysiological data. Thus, the increased GABAergic transmission is a leading candidate mechanism underlying the reduced anxiety-like behaviors observed in GGA3 null mice. All together these findings suggest that GGA3 plays a key role in GABAergic transmission. Since BACE1 levels are elevated in the brain of GGA3 null mice, it is possible that at least some of these phenotypes are a consequence of increased processing of BACE1 substrates.","1932-6203","PloS one","(11) e0155799",2016,"Kendall R","Walker","KR","Alzheimer's Disease Research Laboratory, Department of Neuroscience, Tufts University School of Medicine, 136 Harrison Avenue, St 328A, Boston, Massachusetts, 02111, United States of America."
27199760,"Calcium-Sensing Receptors of Human Neural Cells Play Crucial Roles in Alzheimer's Disease.","In aged subjects, late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) starts in the lateral entorhinal allocortex where a failure of clearance mechanisms triggers an accumulation of neurotoxic amyloid-β42 oligomers (Aβ42-os). In neurons and astrocytes, Aβ42-os enhance the transcription of Aβ precursor protein (APP) and β-secretase/BACE1 genes. Thus, by acting together with γ-secretase, the surpluses of APP and BACE1 amplify the endogenous production of Aβ42-os which pile up, damage mitochondria, and are oversecreted. At the plasmalemma, exogenous Aβ42-os bind neurons' and astrocytes' calcium-sensing receptors (CaSRs) activating a set of intracellular signaling pathways which upkeep Aβ42-os intracellular accumulation and oversecretion by hindering Aβ42-os proteolysis. In addition, Aβ42-os accumulating in the extracellular milieu spread and reach mounting numbers of adjacent and remoter teams of neurons and astrocytes which in turn are recruited, again via Aβ42-os•CaSR-governed mechanisms, to produce and release additional Aβ42-os amounts. This relentless self-sustaining mechanism drives AD progression toward upper cortical areas. Later on accumulating Aβ42-os elicit the advent of hyperphosphorylated (p)-Tau oligomers which acting together with Aβ42-os and other glial neurotoxins cooperatively destroy wider and wider cognition-related cortical areas. In parallel, Aβ42-os•CaSR signals also elicit an excess production and secretion of nitric oxide and vascular endothelial growth factor-A from astrocytes, of Aβ42-os and myelin basic protein from oligodendrocytes, and of proinflammatory cytokines, nitric oxide and (likely) Aβ42-os from microglia. Activated astrocytes and microglia survive the toxic onslaught, whereas neurons and oligodendrocytes increasingly die. However, we have shown that highly selective allosteric CaSR antagonists (calcilytics), like NPS 2143 and NPS 89626, efficiently suppress all the neurotoxic effects Aβ42-os•CaSR signaling drives in cultured cortical untransformed human neurons and astrocytes. In fact, calcilytics increase Aβ42 proteolysis and discontinue the oversecretion of Aβ42-os, nitric oxide, and vascular endothelial growth factor-A from both astrocytes and neurons. Seemingly, calcilytics would also benefit the other types of glial cells and cerebrovascular cells otherwise damaged by the effects of Aβ42-os•CaSR signaling. Thus, given at amnestic minor cognitive impairment (aMCI) or initial symptomatic stages, calcilytics could prevent or terminate the propagation of LOAD neuropathology and preserve human neurons' viability and hence patients' cognitive abilities.

Given that baicalein possess various biological activities, especially its effects on synaptic plasticity and cognitive function, we examined the effect of baicalein on synaptic function both in vitro and in vivo in AD model. The effect of baicalein on Aβ42 oligomer impaired LTP was investigated by electrophysiological methods. Baicalein was administered orally via drinking water to the APP/PS1 mice and sex- and age-matched wild-type mice. Treatment started at 5 months of age and mice were assessed for cognition and AD-like pathology at 7-month-old. Cognition was analyzed by Morris water maze test, fear conditioning test, and novel object recognition test. Changes in hippocampal 12/15 Lipoxygenase (12/15LO) and glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) activity, Aβ production, tau phosphorylation, synaptic plasticity, and dendritic spine density were evaluated. Baicalein prevented Aβ-induced impairments in hippocampal LTP through activation of serine threonine Kinase (Akt) phosphorylation. Long-term oral administration of baicalein inhibited 12/15LO and GSK3β activity, reduced β-secretase enzyme (BACE1), decreased the concentration of total Aβ, and prevented phosphorylation of tau in APP/PS1 mice. Meanwhile, baicalein restored spine number, synaptic plasticity, and memory deficits.

Our previous studies have shown that BACE1 is degraded via the lysosomal pathway and that that depletion of the trafficking molecule Golgi-localized γ-ear-containing ARF-binding protein 3 (GGA3) results in increased BACE1 levels and activity because of impaired lysosomal degradation. We also determined that GGA3 regulation of BACE1 levels requires its ability to bind ubiquitin. Accordingly, we reported that BACE1 is ubiquitinated at lysine 501 and that lack of ubiquitination at lysine 501 produces BACE1 stabilization. Ubiquitin conjugation is a reversible process mediated by deubiquitinating enzymes. The ubiquitin-specific peptidase 8 (USP8), an endosome-associated deubiquitinating enzyme, regulates the ubiquitination, trafficking, and lysosomal degradation of several plasma membrane proteins. Here, we report that RNAi-mediated depletion of USP8 reduced levels of both ectopically expressed and endogenous BACE1 in H4 human neuroglioma cells. Moreover, USP8 depletion increased BACE1 ubiquitination, promoted BACE1 accumulation in the early endosomes and late endosomes/lysosomes, and decreased levels of BACE1 in the recycling endosomes. We also found that decreased BACE1 protein levels were accompanied by a decrease in BACE1-mediated amyloid precursor protein cleavage and amyloid-β levels. Our findings demonstrate that USP8 plays a key role in the trafficking and degradation of BACE1 by deubiquitinating lysine 501.

Here we used mice with deletion of the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAChT) in the forebrain to model cholinergic abnormalities observed in dementia. Whole-genome RNA sequencing of hippocampal samples revealed that cholinergic failure causes changes in RNA metabolism. Remarkably, key transcripts related to Alzheimer's disease are affected. BACE1, for instance, shows abnormal splicing caused by decreased expression of the splicing regulator hnRNPA2/B1. Resulting BACE1 overexpression leads to increased APP processing and accumulation of soluble Aβ1-42. This is accompanied by age-related increases in GSK3 activation, tau hyperphosphorylation, caspase-3 activation, decreased synaptic markers, increased neuronal death, and deteriorating cognition. Pharmacological inhibition of GSK3 hyperactivation reversed deficits in synaptic markers and tau hyperphosphorylation induced by cholinergic dysfunction, indicating a key role for GSK3 in some of these pathological changes. Interestingly, in human brains there was a high correlation between decreased levels of VAChT and hnRNPA2/B1 levels with increased tau hyperphosphorylation. These results suggest that changes in RNA processing caused by cholinergic loss can facilitate Alzheimer's-like pathology in mice, providing a mechanism by which decreased cholinergic tone may increase risk of dementia.","1460-2199","Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)","(27) 3553-3567",2017,"Benjamin","Kolisnyk","B","Robarts Research Institute."

CDK5R1 displays a large and highly evolutionarily conserved 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR), a fact that has suggested a role for this region in the post-transcriptional control of CDK5R1 expression. Our group has recently demonstrated that two miRNAs, miR-103 and miR-107, regulate CDK5R1 expression and affect the levels of p35. MiR-103 and miR-107 belong to the miR-15/107 family, a group of evolutionarily conserved miRNAs highly expressed in human cerebral cortex. In this work, we tested the hypothesis that other members of this group of miRNAs, in addition to miR-103 and miR-107, were able to modulate CDK5R1 expression. We provide evidence that several miRNAs belonging to the miR-15/107 family regulate p35 levels. BACE1 expression levels were also found to be modulated by different members of this family. Furthermore, overexpression of these miRNAs led to reduced APP phosphorylation levels at the CDK5-specific Thr668 residue. We also show that miR-15/107 miRNAs display reduced expression levels in hippocampus and temporal cortex, but not in cerebellum, of AD brains. Moreover, increased CDK5R1 mRNA levels were observed in AD hippocampus tissues. Our results suggest that the downregulation of the miR-15/107 family might have a role in the pathogenesis of AD by increasing the levels of CDK5R1/p35 and consequently enhancing CDK5 activity.","1559-1182","Molecular neurobiology","(54) 4329-4342",2017,"Silvia","Moncini","S","Dipartimento di Biotecnologie Mediche e Medicina Traslazionale, Università degli Studi di Milano, Via Viotti 3/5, 20133, Milan, Italy."

The present study was performed to investigate the protective effects and mechanism of action of a prosaposin-derived 18-mer peptide (PS18: LSELIINNATEELLIKGL) on mice hippocampal progenitor cell proliferation, neurogenesis, and memory tasks after intracerebroventricular injection of Aβ1-42 peptide. Seven days after Aβ1-42 injection, significant proliferation of hippocampal progenitor cells and memory impairment were evident. Two weeks after Aβ1-42 peptide injection, elevated numbers of surviving 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine cells and newly formed neurons were detected. Treatment with PS18 attenuated these effects evoked by Aβ1-42. Our data indicate that treatment with PS18 partially attenuated the increase in hippocampal neurogenesis caused by Aβ1-42-induced neuroinflammation and prevented memory deficits associated with increased numbers of activated glial cells. We observed an increase in ADAM10 and decreases in BACE1, PS1/2, and AβPP protein levels, suggesting that PS18 enhances the nonamyloidogenic AβPP cleavage pathway. Importantly, our results further showed that PS18 activated the PI3K/Akt pathway, phosphorylated GSK-3α/β, and, as a consequence, exerted a neuroprotective effect. In addition, PS18 showed a protective effect against Aβ1-42-induced neurotoxicity via suppression of the caspase pathway; upregulation of Bcl-2; downregulation of BAX, attenuating mitochondrial damage; and inhibition of caspase-3. These findings suggest that PS18 may provide a valuable therapeutic strategy for the treatment of progressive neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD.","1875-8908","Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD","(53) 1173-92",2016,"Hui-Ling","Gao","HL","College of Life and Health Sciences, Northeastern University, Shenyang, China."

27387531,"AβPP processing results in greater toxicity per amount of Aβ1-42 than individually expressed and secreted Aβ1-42 in Drosophila melanogaster.","The aggregation of the amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide into fibrillar deposits has long been considered the key neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Aβ peptides are generated from proteolytic processing of the transmembrane Aβ precursor protein (AβPP) via sequential proteolysis through the β-secretase activity of β-site AβPP-cleaving enzyme (BACE1) and by the intramembranous enzyme γ-secretase. For over a decade, Drosophila melanogaster has been used as a model organism to study AD, and two different approaches have been developed to investigate the toxicity caused by AD-associated gene products in vivo In one model, the Aβ peptide is directly over-expressed fused to a signal peptide, allowing secretion of the peptide into the extracellular space. In the other model, human AβPP is co-expressed with human BACE1, resulting in production of the Aβ peptide through the processing of AβPP by BACE1 and by endogenous fly γ-secretase. Here, we performed a parallel study of flies that expressed the Aβ1-42 peptide alone or that co-expressed AβPP and BACE1. Toxic effects (assessed by eye phenotype, longevity and locomotor assays) and levels of the Aβ1-42, Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-38 peptides were examined. Our data reveal that the toxic effect per amount of detected Aβ1-42 peptide was higher in the flies co-expressing AβPP and BACE1 than in the Aβ1-42-expressing flies, and that the co-existence of Aβ1-42 and Aβ1-40 in the flies co-expressing AβPP and BACE1 could be of significant importance to the neurotoxic effect detected in these flies. Thus, the toxicity detected in these two fly models seems to have different modes of action and is highly dependent on how and where the peptide is generated rather than on the actual level of the Aβ1-42 peptide in the flies. This is important knowledge that needs to be taken into consideration when using Drosophila models to investigate disease mechanisms or therapeutic strategies in AD research.

All known splice variants contain an epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain, which is mediating signaling via receptors of the ErbB family. In particular, NRG1 acts as an essential signaling molecule expressed on the axonal surface, where it signals to Schwann cells throughout development and regulates the thickness of the myelin sheath. NRG1 is required also by other cell types in the nervous system, for instance as an axonal signal released by proprioceptive afferents to induce development of the muscle spindle, and it controls aspects of cortical interneuron development as well as the formation of thalamo-cortical projections. The precursor protein of NRG1 can be activated and released from the membrane through limited proteolysis by the β-Secretase (β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1, BACE1) which was first identified through its function as the rate limiting enzyme of amyloid-β-peptide (Aβ) production. Aβ is the major component of amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Due to the hairpin nature of NRG1 type III two membrane-bound stubs with a type 1 and a type 2 orientation are generated by an initial proteolytic cleavage and successive release of the EGF-like domain either by dual cleavage by BACE1 or by ADAM17 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) which is also called TACE (Tumor Necrosis Factor-α-converting enzyme). The cleavages activate NRG1 to allow juxtacrine or paracrine signaling. The type 1 oriented stub is further cleaved by γ-secretase in the transmembrane domain with a putative role in intracellular domain (ICD) signaling, while the type II oriented stub is cleaved by signal peptidase like proteases (SPPLs). Neuregulin-1 was identified as a major physiological substrate of BACE1 during early postnatal development when similarities in BACE1 KO mice and NRG1 heterozygous mice were discovered. Both display severe hypomyelination of peripheral nerves. Later it was shown with genetic and pharmacological evidence that the developmental effect of type I NRG1 on the formation and the maintenance of muscle spindles is BACE1 dependent. Thus, NRG1 functions in PNS and CNS are likely to set limits to an Alzheimer disease therapy with relatively strong BACE1 inhibition.","1873-2747","Brain research bulletin","(126) 178-182",2016,"Michael","Willem","M","BioMedical Center, Biochemistry, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Feodor-Lynen Strasse 17, 81377 Munich, Germany.

The initial processing of APP by BACE1 is re-gulated by intracellular sorting events of the enzyme, which is a prime target for therapeutic intervention. GWAS (genome-wide sequencing studies) have identified several AD-susceptibility genes that are associated with the regulation of membrane trafficking, and substantial evidence now indicates that AD is likely to arise from defective membrane trafficking in either or both of the secretory and endocytic pathways. Considerable progress has been made in defining the intracellular trafficking pathways of BACE1 and APP and the sorting signals of these membrane proteins that define their itineraries. In this review we highlight recent advances in understanding the regulation of the intracellular sorting of BACE1 and APP, discuss how dysregulation of these trafficking events may lead to enhanced generation of the neurotoxic Aβ products in AD and highlight the unresolved questions in the field.","1470-8728","The Biochemical journal","(473) 1977-93",2016,"Wei Hong","Toh","WH","Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Bio21 Molecular Science and Biotechnology Institute, University of Melbourne, Victoria 3010, Australia."
27418961,"Stepping closer to treating Alzheimer's disease patients with BACE1 inhibitor drugs.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common age-dependent neurodegenerative disease which impairs cognitive function and gradually causes patients to be unable to lead normal daily lives. While the etiology of AD remains an enigma, excessive accumulation of β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) is widely believed to induce pathological changes and cause dementia in brains of AD patients. BACE1 was discovered to initiate the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) at the β-secretase site. Only after this cleavage does γ-secretase further cleave the BACE1-cleaved C-terminal APP fragment to release Aβ. Hence, blocking BACE1 proteolytic activity will suppress Aβ generation. Due to the linkage of Aβ to the potential cause of AD, extensive discovery and development efforts have been directed towards potent BACE1 inhibitors for AD therapy. With the recent breakthrough in developing brain-penetrable BACE1 inhibitors, targeting amyloid deposition-mediated pathology for AD therapy has now become more practical. This review will summarize various strategies that have successfully led to the discovery of BACE1 drugs, such as MK8931, AZD-3293, JNJ-54861911, E2609 and CNP520.

The strategy aims to decrease production of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide from the amyloid precursor protein (APP), thus reducing or preventing Aβ toxicity. Over the last decade, it has become clear that BACE1 proteolytically cleaves a number of substrates in addition to APP. These substrates are not known to be involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease but have other roles in the developing and/or mature central nervous system. Consequently, BACE inhibition and knockout in mice results in synaptic and other neuronal dysfunctions and the key substrates responsible for these deficits are still being elucidated. Of the BACE1 substrates that have been validated to date, a number may contribute to the synaptic deficits seen with BACE blockade, including neuregulin 1, close homologue of L1 and seizure-related gene 6.

Although it is believed that the net charge of the Asp dyad is -1, the exact protonation state still remains a matter of debate. We carried out molecular dynamic (MD) simulations for the four protonation states of BACE1 proteins. We applied Glide docking studies to 21 BACE1 inhibitors against the MD extracted conformations.

However, biomarkers that require testing in the brain tissue pose a formidable practical barrier to AD diagnostic innovation. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are responsible for control of gene expression at the posttranscriptional level and are essential for the function of neuronal networks and neuronal survival. miRNA expression can impact the regulation of APP (amyloid beta A4 precursor protein), PSEN1 (presenilin 1), PSEN2 (presenilin 2), and BACE1 (beta-secretase 1) genes in the brain that were previously implicated in AD pathophysiology. Little is known, however, on the extent to which peripheral tissue (e.g., whole blood) miRNA variation might offer clinical predictive value for AD. Moreover, few studies have examined multiple peripheral miRNA expression data at the same time. We report here, to the best of our knowledge, the first whole-blood-based and parallel study of seven miRNAs (hsa-miR-9-5p, hsa-miR-29a-3p, hsa-miR-106a-5p, hsa-miR-106b-5p, hsa-miR-107, hsa-miR-125a-3p, and hsa-miR-125b-5p) in relation to AD susceptibility.

We measured the whole-blood miRNA expression by a real-time polymerase chain reaction in a large study sample (n = 281), comprising patients with AD (n = 172) and healthy controls (n = 109). A reduction in whole-blood expression of hsa-miR-9-5p, hsa-miR-106a-5p, hsa-miR-106b-5p, and hsa-miR-107 was significantly associated with an increased risk of AD (p < 0.05).

On the other hand, the expression of hsa-miR-29a-3p, hsa-miR-125a-3p, and hsa-miR-125b-5p was not significantly different between patients and controls (p > 0.05).

Fuzhisan (FZS), a Chinese herbal complex prescription, has been used for the treatment AD for over 20 years, and is known to enhance the cognitive ability in AD patients as well as in AD model rats. To investigate mechanisms of AD and the potential therapy of FZS in AD, we treated senescence-accelerated mouse SAMP8 mice, a useful model of AD-related memory impairment, with FZS by intragastrical administration for 8 weeks and Donepizel was used as a positive control. The results showed that FZS (0.3, 0.6, and 1.2 g/kg/day) improved impaired cognitive ability of aged SAMP8 mice in a dose-dependent manner. FZS robustly decreased Aβ level and phosphorylation of tau. This was accompanied by a significant decrease in the BACE1 level and phosphorylated APP (Thr668). Futhermore, The p25/Cdk5 pathway was markedly down-regulated by FZS treatment. These results indicated that the memory ameliorating effect of FZS may be, in part, by regulation the p25/Cdk5 pathway which may contribute to down-regulation of Aβ and tau hyperphosphorylation.","1573-6903","Neurochemical research","(41) 3074-3082",2016,"Zhao-Xu","Zhang","ZX","Department of Neurology, The Shandong Province Qianfoshan Hospital, Jinan, 250000, China. hydzhangzhaoxu@163.com."
27524794,"Alzheimer-related decrease in CYFIP2 links amyloid production to tau hyperphosphorylation and memory loss.","Characteristic features of Alzheimer's disease are memory loss, plaques resulting from abnormal processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP), and presence of neurofibrillary tangles and dystrophic neurites containing hyperphosphorylated tau. Currently, it is not known what links these abnormalities together. Cytoplasmic FMR1 interacting protein 2 (CYFIP2) has been suggested to regulate mRNA translation at synapses and this may include local synthesis of APP and alpha-calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase II, a kinase that can phosphorylate tau. Further, CYFIP2 is part of the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein-family verprolin-homologous protein complex, which has been implicated in actin polymerization at synapses, a process thought to be required for memory formation. Our previous studies on p25 dysregulation put forward the hypothesis that CYFIP2 expression is reduced in Alzheimer's disease and that this contributes to memory impairment, abnormal APP processing and tau hyperphosphorylation. Here, we tested this hypothesis. First, in post-mortem tissue CYFIP2 expression was reduced by ∼50% in severe Alzheimer's hippocampus and superior temporal gyrus when normalized to expression of a neuronal or synaptic marker protein. Interestingly, there was also a trend for decreased expression in mild Alzheimer's disease hippocampus. Second, CYFIP2 expression was reduced in old but not in young Tg2576 mice, a model of familial Alzheimer's disease. Finally, we tested the direct impact of reduced CYFIP2 expression in heterozygous null mutant mice. We found that in hippocampus this reduced expression causes an increase in APP and β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) protein, but not mRNA expression, and elevates production of amyloid-β","1460-2156","Brain : a journal of neurology","(139) 2751-2765",2016,"Sachin Suresh","Tiwari","SS","1 Department of Basic and Clinical Neuroscience, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King's College London, 125 Coldharbour Lane, London, SE5 9NU, UK."

In this study, we found that cystatin C (CysC), a natural cysteine protease inhibitor, is able to reduce Aβ40 secretion in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMEC). The CysC-induced Aβ40 reduction was caused by degradation of β-secretase BACE1 through the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. In contrast, we found that CysC promoted secretion of soluble APPα indicating the activated non-amyloidogenic processing of APP in HBMEC. Further results revealed that α-secretase ADAM10, which was transcriptionally upregulated in response to CysC, was required for the CysC-induced sAPPα secretion. Knockdown of SIRT1 abolished CysC-triggered ADAM10 upregulation and sAPPα production. Taken together, our results demonstrated that exogenously applied CysC can direct amyloidogenic APP processing to non-amyloidgenic pathway in brain endothelial cells, mediated by proteasomal degradation of BACE1 and SIRT1-mediated ADAM10 upregulation.

Meanwhile, miR-98-5p dysregulation was found in AD. However, whether miR-98-5p is involved in the accumulation of Aβ in AD, the underlying molecule mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, we confirmed that miR-98-5p negatively regulated sorting nexin 6 (SNX6) expression by targeting the 3'-UTR of SNX6 mRNA. Downregulation of miR-98-5p alleviated Aβ-induced viability inhibition and decreased apoptosis in SK-N-SH and SH-SY5Y cells by upregulating SNX6 expression. Furthermore, downregulation of miR-98-5p decreased SNX6-dependent levels of Aβ40, Aβ42, β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), soluble amyloid precursor protein β (sAPPβ), and membrane-associated APP β-carboxyl terminal fragment (βCTF) in SK-N-SH and HEK293 cells.

Peripheral administration of enoxaparin (ENO) reportedly reduces the level of Aβ and the amyloid plaques in the cortex of amyloid precursor protein (APP) transgenic mice. However, the exact mechanism of these effects is unclear. Our previous studies indicated that ENO can inhibit APP processing to Aβ in primary cortical cells from Tg2576 mice by downregulating BACE1 levels. This study examines whether ENO-induced reduction of amyloid load is due to the decreased APP processing to Aβ in Tg2576 mice. Surprisingly, our results indicated that ENO significantly increases the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio in cortex and enhances the amyloid plaque load in both cortex and hippocampus, although overall APP processing was not influenced by ENO. Moreover, ENO stimulated the aggregation of both Aβ40 and Aβ42 in vitro. Although ENO has been reported to improve cognition in vivo and has potential as a therapeutic agent for AD, the results from our study suggest that ENO can exacerbate the amyloid pathology, and the strategy of using ENO for the treatment of AD may require further assessment. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","1097-4547","Journal of neuroscience research","(95) 992-999",2017,"Hao","Cui","H","College of Life Science, Jiangxi Normal University, Nanchang, China."

DHED (0.5 mg/kg) was intraperitoneally administered to 7-month-old Tg and wild type mice for 4 months. In passive avoidance and water maze tests, DHED improved memory impairment of Tg mice after 4 months of administration. DHED also reduced cortical levels of soluble Aβ40, soluble Aβ42 and total Aβ peptides in the Tg mice. Additionally, we investigated whether DHED may be a β-secretase inhibitor that affects the production of Aβ related to the formation of neuritic plaques. DHED directly inhibited β-secretase activity in a concentrationdependent manner. The concentration required for 50 % enzyme inhibition (IC50) was 40.96 μM, and DHED may act as a competitive inhibitor of β-secretase. Moreover, DHED interacted strongly with BACE1 (β-secretase 2QP8), as demonstrated in the analysis of the binding mode of DHED in the active site of human BACE1.

We hypothesize that RIP140 may also affect Aβ generation because it modulates the activity of transcription factors previously implicated in amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ). We found that the levels of RIP140 are reduced in Alzheimer's disease (AD) postmortem brains compared with healthy controls. In addition, in situ hybridization experiments revealed that RIP140 expression is enriched in the same brain areas involved in AD pathology, such as cortex and hippocampus. Furthermore, we provide evidence using cell lines and genetically modified mice that RIP140 is able to modulate the transcription of certain genes involved in AD pathology, such as β-APP cleaving enzyme (BACE1) and GSK3. Consequently, we found that RIP140 overexpression reduced the generation of Aβ in a neuroblastoma cell line by decreasing the transcription of β-APP cleaving enzyme via a PPARγ-dependent mechanism. The results of this study therefore provide molecular insights into common signaling pathways linking metabolic disease with AD.","1558-1497","Neurobiology of aging","(47) 180-191",2016,"Katrin","Blondrath","K","Division of Brain Sciences, Department of Medicine, Imperial College London, London, UK."
27618097,"Effects of Folic Acid on Secretases Involved in Aβ Deposition in APP/PS1 Mice.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of dementia. Amyloid-β protein (Aβ) is identified as the core protein of neuritic plaques. Aβ is generated by the sequential cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) via the APP cleaving enzyme (α-secretase, or β-secretase) and γ-secretase. Previous studies indicated that folate deficiency elevated Aβ deposition in APP/PS1 mice, and this rise was prevented by folic acid. In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether folic acid could influence the generation of Aβ by regulating α-, β-, and γ-secretase. Herein, we demonstrated that folic acid reduced the deposition of Aβ42 in APP/PS1 mice brain by decreasing the mRNA and protein expressions of β-secretase [beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1)] and γ-secretase complex catalytic component-presenilin 1 (PS1)-in APP/PS1 mice brain. Meanwhile, folic acid increased the levels of ADAM9 and ADAM10, which are important α-secretases in ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloprotease) family. However, folic acid has no impact on the protein expression of nicastrin (Nct), another component of γ-secretase complex. Moreover, folic acid regulated the expression of miR-126-3p and miR-339-5p, which target ADAM9 and BACE1, respectively. Taken together, the effect of folic acid on Aβ deposition may relate to making APP metabolism through non-amyloidogenic pathway by decreasing β-secretase and increasing α-secretase.

However, the development of a selective BACE1 inhibitor is difficult due to its highly flexible catalytic site and homology to other aspartic proteases, including BACE2 and Cathepsin D (CTSD). Aiming to better understand the structural factors responsible for selective BACE1 inhibition, we performed alignment studies, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and docking studies to explore the recognition of four selective BACE1 inhibitors by aspartyl proteases. The results show that selective BACE1 inhibition may be due to the formation of strong electrostatic interactions with Asp32 and Asp228 and a large number of hydrogen bonds, π-π and Van der Waals interactions with the amino acid residues located inside the catalytic cavity, which has different volume and shape compared to BACE2 and CTSD. Hindrance effects avoid the accommodation of ligands in the small catalytic site of BACE2, resulting in a lower affinity and the high cavity of CTSD results in the formation of a small number of interactions with the ligands, although they show a similar binding mode with BACE1. These results might help to rationalize the design of selective BACE1 inhibitors.","1768-3254","European journal of medicinal chemistry","(124) 1142-1154",2016,"Maricarmen","Hernández-Rodríguez","M","Laboratorio de Modelado Molecular y Bioinformática y diseño de farmaos, Escuela Superior de Medicina, Instituto Politécnico Nacional, Plan de San Luis y Díaz Mirón s/n, 11340 México D.F, Mexico; Laboratorio de Biofísica y Biocatálisis, Escuela Superior de Medicina, Instituto Politécnico Nacional, Plan de San Luis y Díaz Mirón s/n, 11340 México D.F, Mexico; Departamento de Farmacología, Escuela Superior de Medicina, Instituto Politécnico Nacional, Plan de San Luis y Díaz Mirón s/n, 11340 México D.F, Mexico."

We designed a 100% cis-locked cyclic dipeptide composed of cyclized phospho-Thr-Pro (pCDP) as a mimic for this putative pathological conformation, and three phosphate-blocked derivatives (pCDP-diBzl, pCDP-Bzl, and pCDP-diPOM). Two H4 neuroglioma cell lines were established as AD cell models for use in testing these compounds: H4-AβPP695 for stable overexpression of wild-type AβPP695, and H4-BACE1 for stable overexpression of β-site AβPP cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE1). The level of the secreted AβPP fragment resulting from BACE1 activity, sAβPPβ, served as a key proxy for amyloidogenic processing, since cleavage of AβPP by BACE1 is a requisite first step in Aβ production. Of the compounds tested, pCDP-diBzl decreased sAβPPβ levels in both cell lines, while pCDP-diPOM decreased sAβPPβ levels in only H4-BACE1 cells, all with similar dose-dependences and patterns of proteolytic AβPP fragments. Enzymatic assays showed that none of the pCDP derivatives directly inhibit BACE1 catalytic activity. These results suggest a model in which pCDP-diBzl and pCDP-diPOM act at a common point to inhibit entry of AβPP into the amyloidogenic AβPP processing pathway but through different targets, and provide important insights for the development of novel AD therapeutics.","1875-8908","Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD","(55) 391-410",2017,"Carolyn L","Fisher","CL","Department of Molecular Biology & Genetics, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, USA."

Here we examined how changes in the carbohydrate moiety of gangliosides alter APP processing in human melanoma cells, neuroectoderm-derived cells. We showed that forced expression of GD2, GM2 or GM1 (by introducing B4GALNT1 cDNA into cells not expressing this glycosyltransferase) results in increases of α- and β-site cleavages of APP with a prominent increase in β-cleavage. We also showed that β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) protein is highly protected from the degradation in cells expressing these gangliosides, thereby increasing the expression of this protein. Unexpectedly, adding gangliosides exogenously altered neither BACE1 levels nor β-site cleavage. The stabilisation of BACE1 protein led to the increase of this protein in lipid rafts, where BACE1 processes APP.

These problems prompted us to combine molecular dynamics (MD) simulation with ligand-receptor contacts analysis as means to develop valid pharmacophore model(s). The particular ligand-receptor complex is allowed to perturb over a few nano-seconds using MD simulation. Subsequently, ligand-receptor contact points (≤2.5 Å) are identified. Ligand-receptor contacts maintained above certain threshold during molecular dynamics simulation are considered critical and used to guide pharmacophore development. We termed this method as Molecular-Dynamics Based Ligand-Receptor Contact Analysis. We implemented this new methodology to develop valid pharmacophore models for check point kinase 1 (Chk1) and beta-secretase 1 (BACE1) inhibitors as case studies. The resulting pharmacophore models were validated by receiver operating characteristic curved analysis against inhibitors obtained from CHEMBL database.","1573-4951","Journal of computer-aided molecular design","(30) 1149-1163",2016,"Ma'mon M","Hatmal","MM","Department of Medical Laboratory Sciences, Faculty of Allied Health Sciences, The Hashemite University, Zarqa, Jordan."

We find that several BACE1 inhibitors blocked CatD activity in cells with much greater potency than that displayed in cell-free assays with purified protein. Through a series of exploratory toxicology studies, we show that quantifying CatD target engagement in cells with the probe is predictive of ocular toxicity in vivo. Taken together, our findings designate off-target inhibition of CatD as a principal driver of ocular toxicity for BACE1 inhibitors and more generally underscore the power of chemical proteomics for discerning mechanisms of drug action.","2041-1723","Nature communications","(7) 13042",2016,"Andrea M","Zuhl","AM","Pfizer Worldwide Research and Development, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139, USA."
27734813,"[Small molecule inhibitors of PERK-dependent signaling pathway as a novel, therapeutic molecular strategy in Alzheimer's disease treatment].","Nowadays more than 24 million people suffer from Alzheimer's disease (AD) that is the most common progressive cause of dementia. Molecular mechanisms of neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease is closely link with accumulation of misfolded proteins in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Deposition of senile plaques is one of the main feature of Alzheimer's disease as well as is strictly correlated with impairment of cognitive abilities. The accumulation of misfolded proteins in the lumen of the ER triggers activation of the ER stress, and subsequently unfolded protein response (UPR) signaling branches, which consists of a cascade of events on the molecular level of nerve cell. That results in attenuation of global protein translation mediated by the activated Protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) through phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α). On the contrary, prolonged ER stress contributes to preferential translation of proteins such as Activating Transcription Factor 4 (ATF4) and CCAAT-enhancer binding protein homologous protein (CHOP) engaged in apoptotic cell death. Moreover, ensues preferential translation of enzyme beta-secretase 1 (BACE1), which is an enzyme involved in deposition of senile plagues in brain tissue, that are the main cause of cognitive impairment. Recent molecular and genetic investigations present a new point of view on the therapeutic strategy for AD. Deactivation of PERK kinase via smallmolecule inhibitors has been identified as a potential therapeutic target. It is highly possible that the inhibition of PERK activity may contribute to preventing the excessive accumulation of senile plaques among the neurons and, as a result, neuronal loss and significant decline in cognitive abilities in AD.","1426-9686","Polski merkuriusz lekarski : organ Polskiego Towarzystwa Lekarskiego","(41) 5-10",2016,"Wioletta","Rozpędek","W","Department of Clinical Chemistry and Biochemistry, Medical University of Lodz, Poland."

27750187,"A molecular dynamics study of the BACE1 conformational change from Apo to closed form induced by hydroxyethylamine derived compounds.","BACE1 is an aspartyl protease which is a therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease (AD) because of its participation in the rate-limiting step in the production of Aβ-peptide, the accumulation of which produces senile plaques and, in turn, the neurodegenerative effects associated with AD. The active site of this protease is composed in part by two aspartic residues (Asp93 and Asp289). Additionally, the catalytic site has been found to be covered by an antiparallel hairpin loop called the flap. The dynamics of this flap are fundamental to the catalytic function of the enzyme. When BACE1 is inactive (Apo), the flap adopts an open conformation, allowing a substrate or inhibitor to access the active site. Subsequent interaction with the ligand induces flap closure and the stabilization of the macromolecular complex. Further, the protonation state of the aspartic dyad is affected by the chemical nature of the species entering the active site, so that appropriate selection of protonation states for the ligand and the catalytic residues will permit the elucidation of the inhibitory pathway for BACE1. In the present study, comparative analysis of different combinations of protonation states for the BACE1-hydroxyethylamine (HEA) system is reported. HEAs are potent inhibitors of BACE1 with favorable pharmacological and kinetic properties, as well as oral bioavailability. The results of Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations and population density calculations using 8 different parameters demonstrate that the LnAsp289 configuration (HEA with a neutral amine and the Asp289 residue protonated) is the only one which permits the expected conformational change in BACE1, from apo to closed form, after flap closure. Additionally, differences in their capacities to establish and maintain interactions with residues such as Asp93, Gly95, Thr133, Asp289, Gly291, and Asn294 during this step allow differentiation among the inhibitory activities of the HEAs. The results and methodology here reported will serve to elucidate the inhibitory pathway of other families of compounds that act as BACE1 inhibitors, as well as the design of better leader compounds for the treatment of AD.","1873-4243","Journal of molecular graphics & modelling","(70) 181-195",2016,"Carlos","Gueto-Tettay","C","Grupo de Química Bioorgánica, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales, Universidad de Cartagena, Colombia."

We previously reported that PGC-1α also regulates the transcription of β-APP cleaving enzyme (BACE1), the main enzyme involved in Aβ generation, and its expression is decreased in AD patients. We aimed to explore the potential therapeutic effect of PGC-1α by generating a lentiviral vector to express human PGC-1α and target it by stereotaxic delivery to hippocampus and cortex of APP23 transgenic mice at the preclinical stage of the disease. Four months after injection, APP23 mice treated with hPGC-1α showed improved spatial and recognition memory concomitant with a significant reduction in Aβ deposition, associated with a decrease in BACE1 expression. hPGC-1α overexpression attenuated the levels of proinflammatory cytokines and microglial activation. This effect was accompanied by a marked preservation of pyramidal neurons in the CA3 area and increased expression of neurotrophic factors. The neuroprotective effects were secondary to a reduction in Aβ pathology and neuroinflammation, because wild-type mice receiving the same treatment were unaffected. These results suggest that the selective induction of PGC-1α gene in specific areas of the brain is effective in targeting AD-related neurodegeneration and holds potential as therapeutic intervention for this disease.","1091-6490","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","(113) 12292-12297",2016,"Loukia","Katsouri","L","Division of Brain Sciences, Imperial College London, London W12 0NN, United Kingdom."

However, it is not very clear whether pre-symptomatic AD leads to circadian disruption or whether malfunction of circadian rhythms exerts influence on development of AD. Here, we report a functional clock that exists in the hippocampus. This oscillator both receives input signals and maintains the cycling of the hippocampal Per2 gene. One of the potential inputs to the oscillator is orexin signaling, which can shorten the hippocampal clock period and thereby regulate the expression of clock-controlled-genes (CCGs). A 24-h time course qPCR analysis followed by a JTK_CYCLE algorithm analysis indicated that a number of AD-risk genes are potential CCGs in the hippocampus. Specifically, we found that Bace1 and Bace2, which are related to the production of the amyloid-beta peptide, are CCGs. BACE1 is inhibited by E4BP4, a repressor of D-box genes, while BACE2 is activated by CLOCK:BMAL1. Finally, we observed alterations in the rhythmic expression patterns of Bace2 and ApoE in the hippocampus of aged APP/PS1dE9 mice. Our results therefore indicate that there is a circadian oscillator in the hippocampus whose oscillation could be regulated by orexins. Hence, orexin signaling regulates both the hippocampal clock and the circadian oscillation of AD-risk genes.","2045-2322","Scientific reports","(6) 36035",2016,"Zhixiong","Ma","Z","College of Life Sciences, Beijing Normal University, Beijing 100875, China."

Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy reveal that binding of β-ecdysone induces conformational transition of the protein from open to closed form thereby blocking substrate binding. Even 500nM of the compound completely blocks the enzyme activity. Furthermore, β-ecdysone strongly inhibits Aβ aggregation, evident from ANS and ThT binding assay. Co-incubation of equimolar peptide and β-ecdysone completely inhibits Aβ fibril formation which is further complemented by the AFM study.

27875558,"Palmitoylated APP Forms Dimers, Cleaved by BACE1.","A major rate-limiting step for Aβ generation and deposition in Alzheimer's disease brains is BACE1-mediated cleavage (β-cleavage) of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). We previously reported that APP undergoes palmitoylation at two cysteine residues (Cys186 and Cys187) in the E1-ectodomain. 8-10% of total APP is palmitoylated in vitro and in vivo. Palmitoylated APP (palAPP) shows greater preference for β-cleavage than total APP in detergent resistant lipid rafts. Protein palmitoylation is known to promote protein dimerization. Since dimerization of APP at its E1-ectodomain results in elevated BACE1-mediated cleavage of APP, we have now investigated whether palmitoylation of APP affects its dimerization and whether this leads to elevated β-cleavage of the protein. Here we report that over 90% of palAPP is dimerized while only ~20% of total APP forms dimers. PalAPP-dimers are predominantly cis-oriented while total APP dimerizes in both cis- and trans-orientation. PalAPP forms dimers 4.5-times more efficiently than total APP. Overexpression of the palmitoylating enzymes DHHC7 and DHHC21 that increase palAPP levels and Aβ release, also increased APP dimerization in cells. Conversely, inhibition of APP palmitoylation by pharmacological inhibitors reduced APP-dimerization in coimmunoprecipitation and FLIM/FRET assays. Finally, in vitro BACE1-activity assays demonstrate that palmitoylation-dependent dimerization of APP promotes β-cleavage of APP in lipid-rich detergent resistant cell membranes (DRMs), when compared to total APP. Most importantly, generation of sAPPβ-sAPPβ dimers is dependent on APP-palmitoylation while total sAPPβ generation is not. Since BACE1 shows preference for palAPP dimers over total APP, palAPP dimers may serve as novel targets for effective β-cleavage inhibitors of APP as opposed to BACE1 inhibitors.","1932-6203","PloS one","(11) e0166400",2016,"Raja","Bhattacharyya","R","Genetics and Aging Research Unit, MassGeneral Institute for Neurodegenerative Diseases (MIND), Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Charlestown, MA 02129, United States of America."

Aβ is a cleaved fragment of APP via BACE1, which is the rate-limiting enzyme in APP processing and Aβ generation. Nuclear receptor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) is considered to be a potential target for AD treatment, because of its potent antioxidant and inhibitory effects on Aβ production by negatively regulating BACE1. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a highly active catechin found in green tea, is known to enhance metabolic activity and cognitive ability in the mice model of AD. To investigate whether the therapeutic effect of EGCG is related to the PPARγ pathway, we analysed the alterations in the intracellular molecular expression of PPARγ after EGCG treatment in the N2a/APP695 cell line. In this study, we observed that EGCG attenuated Aβ generation in N2a/APP695 cells, such as the PPARγ agonist, pioglitazone, by suppressing the transcription and translation of BACE1 and that its effect was attenuated by the PPARγ inhibitor, GW9662. Intriguingly, EGCG significantly reinforced the activity of PPARγ by promoting its mRNA and protein expressions in N2a/APP695 cells. Moreover, EGCG also decreased the expression of pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax, caspase-3), reduced the activity of the anti-inflammatory agent NF-κB and inhibited the oxidative stress by decreasing the levels of ROS and MDA and increasing the expression of MnSOD. Co-administration of GW9662 also significantly decreased the EGCG-mediated neuroprotective effect evidenced by the increase in oxidative stress and inflammatory markers. The therapeutic efficacy of EGCG in AD may be derived from the up-regulation of PPARγ mRNA and protein expressions.","1573-6903","Neurochemical research","(42) 468-480",2017,"Zhao-Xu","Zhang","ZX","Department of Neurology, The Shandong Province Qianfoshan Hospital, Jinan, 250000, China. hydzhangzhaoxu@163.com."

We identify a novel neuron-specific polarisation of Aβ generation controlled by Bin1 and CD2AP We discover that Bin1 and CD2AP control Aβ generation in axonal and dendritic early endosomes, respectively. Both Bin1 loss of function and CD2AP loss of function raise Aβ generation by increasing APP and BACE1 convergence in early endosomes, however via distinct sorting events. When Bin1 levels are reduced, BACE1 is trapped in tubules of early endosomes and fails to recycle in axons. When CD2AP levels are reduced, APP is trapped at the limiting membrane of early endosomes and fails to be sorted for degradation in dendrites. Hence, Bin1 and CD2AP keep APP and BACE1 apart in early endosomes by distinct mechanisms in axon and dendrites. Individuals carrying variants of either factor would slowly accumulate Aβ in neurons increasing the risk for late-onset AD.","1469-3178","EMBO reports","(18) 102-122",2017,"Florent","Ubelmann","F","Neuronal Trafficking in Aging Lab, CEDOC, Chronic Diseases Research Centre, NOVA Medical School/Faculdade de Ciências Médicas, Universidade NOVA de Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal."

Thus, impairment of lysosomal function plays an important role in neuronal degeneration and in the pathogenesis of numerous neurodegenerative diseases. In this work we analyzed how inhibition and/or loss of the major lysosomal proteases, the cysteine cathepsins B and L (CtsB/L), affects lysosomal function, cholesterol metabolism and degradation of the key Alzheimer's disease (AD) proteins. Here, we show that cysteine CtsB/L, and not the aspartyl cathepsin D (CtsD), represent a major lysosomal protease(s) that control lysosomal function, intracellular cholesterol trafficking and AD-like amyloidogenic features. Intriguingly, accumulation of free cholesterol in late endosomes/lysosomes upon CtsB/L inhibition resembled a phenotype characteristic for the rare neurodegenerative disorder Niemann-Pick type C (NPC). CtsB/L inhibition and not the inhibition of CtsD led to lysosomal impairment assessed by decreased degradation of EGF receptor, enhanced LysoTracker staining and accumulation of several lysosomal proteins LC3II, NPC1 and NPC2. By measuring the levels of NPC1 and ABCA1, the two major cholesterol efflux proteins, we showed that CtsB/L inhibition or genetic depletion caused accumulation of the NPC1 in lysosomes and downregulation of ABCA1 protein levels and its expression. Furthermore, we revealed that CtsB/L are involved in degradation of the key Alzheimer's proteins: amyloid-β peptides (Aβ) and C-terminal fragments of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and in degradation of β-secretase (BACE1). Our results imply CtsB/L as major regulators of lysosomal function and demonstrate that CtsB/L may play an important role in intracellular cholesterol trafficking and in degradation of the key AD proteins. Our findings implicate that enhancing the activity or levels of CtsB/L could provide a promising and a common strategy for maintaining lysosomal function and for preventing and/or treating neurodegenerative diseases.","1932-6203","PloS one","(11) e0167428",2016,"Stjepko","Cermak","S","Division of Molecular Medicine, Rudjer Boskovic Institute, Croatia."

Mild inhibition of AChE has been shown to have therapeutic relevance in Alzheimer's disease (AD), myasthenia gravis, and glaucoma among others. In contrast, strong inhibition of AChE can lead to cholinergic poisoning. To combat this, AChE reactivators have to be developed to remove the offending AChE inhibitor, restoring acetylcholine levels to normal. Areas covered: This article covers recent advances in the development of acetylcholinesterase modulators, including both inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase for the efforts in development of new chemical entities for treatment of AD, as well as re-activators for resurrection of organophosphate bound acetylcholinesterase. Expert opinion: Over the past three years, research efforts have continued to identify novel small molecules as AChE inhibitors for both CNS and peripheral diseases. The more recent patent activity has focused on three AChE ligand design areas: derivatives of known AChE ligands, natural product based scaffolds and multifunctional ligands, all of which have produced some unique chemical matter with AChE inhibition activities in the mid picomolar to low micromolar ranges. New AChE inhibitors with polypharmacology or dual inhibitory activity have also emerged as highlighted by new AChE inhibitors with dual activity at L-type calcium channels, GSK-3, BACE1 and H3, although most only show low micromolar activity, thus further research is warranted. New small molecule reactivators of organophosphate-inhibited AChE have also been disclosed, which focused on the design of neutral ligands with improved pharmaceutical properties and blood-brain barrier (BBB) penetration. Gratifyingly, some research in this area is moving away from the traditional quaternary pyridinium oximes AChE reactivators, while still employing the necessary reactivation group (oximes). However, selectivity over inhibition of native AChE enzyme, effectiveness of reactivation, broad-spectrum reactivation against multiple organophosphates and reactivation of aged-enzyme continue to be hurdles for this area of research.","1744-7674","Expert opinion on therapeutic patents","(27) 455-476",2017,"Stanton F","McHardy","SF","a Center for Innovative Drug Discovery, Department of Chemistry , University of Texas San Antonio, One UTSA Circle , San Antonio , TX , USA."

BACE1 (β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1) is the rate-limiting enzyme responsible for the β-cleavage of amyloid precursor proteins to Aβ peptides. In this study, endogenous Aβ and C99 accumulation was explored in N2a Swe cells exposed to 1% FBS medium. Increased Aβ and C99 levels were significantly attenuated by taxifolin alone and in combination with cilostazol. Increased phosphorylated JAK2 at Tyr1007/1008 (P-JAK), phosphorylated STAT3 at Tyr 705 (P-STAT3) expressions and increased expressions of BACE1 mRNA and protein in the activated N2a Swe cells were significantly attenuated by taxifolin (10~50 μM), cilostazol (10~50 μM) alone and in combination at minimum concentrations. In these cells, decreased cytosol IκBα expression was elevated, and increased nuclear NF-κB p65 level and nuclear NF-κB p65 DNA binding activity were significantly reduced by taxifolin and cilostazol in a similar manner.

There is abundant literature revealing that exposures to hypoxia/ischemia increase the amyloidogenic processing of amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) leading to the accumulation of amyloid-β peptides in brain. This hypoxia-induced response has been attributed to a significant increase in the activities of β- and γ-secretases, whereas α-secretase activity decreases in hypoxia. Recent studies have indicated that hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α) stimulates the transcription of the β-secretase 1 (BACE1) gene through the hypoxia-response element in the BACE1 promoter. Moreover, HIF-1α protein can directly interact with the γ-secretase complex and increase its activity in a non-transcriptional manner. Hypoxia/ischemia also trigger endoplasmic reticulum stress and impair autophagy in brain, which consequently can stimulate the expression of presenilin 1 (PS1) and activate γ-secretase. Subsequently, PS1 protein can stabilize HIF-1α protein and in addition, APP intracellular domain peptide is able to induce the expression of HIF-1α. The activation of β- and γ-secretases is an evolutionarily conserved hypoxia response, e.g. it is also present in zebrafish. Given that β- and γ-secretases have many substrates in addition to APP, one could postulate that AD pathology is a byproduct of the rescue process mediated by these two aspartyl proteinases under hypoxic/ischemic conditions. We will review the recent evidence indicating that vascular dysfunctions can provoke AD pathology by activating β- and γ-secretases.","1471-4159","Journal of neurochemistry","(140) 536-549",2017,"Antero","Salminen","A","Department of Neurology, Institute of Clinical Medicine, University of Eastern Finland, Kuopio, Finland."

Pathological alterations contribute to diseases such as hypertension, cancer, autoimmune disorders or neurodegenerative diseases. Hence, studying disease-related perturbations of the secretome and the secretome itself covers an important aspect of cellular physiology. We recently developed the secretome protein enrichment with click sugars (SPECS) method that enables the analysis of secretomes of in vitro cell cultures even in the presence of FCS with MS. So far, SPECS facilitated the identification of protease substrates of BACE1, SPPL3 and ADAM10. Though, the SPECS method has already enabled deep insights into secretome biology, we aimed to improve the SPECS protocol to obtain even more information from MS-based secretome analysis and reduce the amount of input material. Here, we optimised the reaction buffer, the pH and replaced Dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO) PEG12-biotin with the more water-soluble variant DBCO-sulpho-biotin to finally provide an optimised protocol of the recently published SPECS protocol. Overall, the number of quantified glycoproteins and their average sequence coverage was increased by 1.6- and 2.4-fold, respectively.

The membrane transport of newly synthesized APP from the Golgi to the endolysosomal system is not well defined, yet it is likely to be critical for regulating its processing by β-secretase (BACE1) and γ-secretase.

We show that Arl5b, a small G protein localized to the TGN, and AP4 are essential for the post-Golgi transport of APP to early endosomes. Arl5b is physically associated with AP4 and is required for the recruitment of AP4, but not AP1, to the TGN. Depletion of either Arl5b or AP4 results in the accumulation of APP, but not BACE1, in the Golgi, and an increase in APP processing and Aβ secretion.

Results demonstrated that a HFD increased the lipid accumulation in the CA3 hippocampus and the levels of plasma lipids, including triglycerides, total cholesterol, low‑density lipoprotein, and high‑density lipoprotein. In addition, CA3 neurons in the HFD group indicated apparent injuries and increased neuronal apoptosis, which are associated with the expression of Bcl‑2, Bax, and caspase‑3. A HFD also increased the expression levels of PCSK9 and BACE1. BACE1 promotes cleavage of amyloid precursor proteins to generate β‑amyloid peptide (Aβ), which induces neuronal apoptosis. Protein levels of Aβ are associated with the observation of amyloid plaques in the hippocampus of the HFD group. The results suggest that hyperlipidemia regulates neuronal apoptosis by increasing PCSK9 and BACE1 expression. Overall, the current study may elucidate the role of lipid metabolism disorder in AD pathogenesis.","1791-3004","Molecular medicine reports","(15) 712-718",2017,"Xue-Shan","Zhao","XS","Institute of Cardiovascular Disease, Key Laboratory for Arteriosclerology of Hunan University of South China, Hengyang, Hunan 421001, P.R.

Genetic deletion of Bace1 leads to behavioral alterations and affects midbrain dopaminergic signaling and memory processes. In order to further understand the role of BACE1 in brain function and behavior, we performed microarray transcriptome profiling and gene pathway analysis in the hippocampus of BACE1-deficient mice compared to wild type. We identified a total of 91 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), mostly enriched in pathways related to the immune and inflammation systems, particularly IL-9 and NF-κB activation pathways. Serum levels of IL-9 were elevated in BACE1-deficient mice. Our network analysis supports an intimate connection between immune response via NF-κB and BACE1 signaling through the NRG1/Akt1 pathway. Our findings warrant future mechanistic studies to determine if BACE1 signaling and the IL-9 pathway interact to alter behavior and brain function.

28005987,"Metabolic Characterization of Intact Cells Reveals Intracellular Amyloid Beta but Not Its Precursor Protein to Reduce Mitochondrial Respiration.","One hallmark of Alzheimer´s disease are senile plaques consisting of amyloid beta (Aβ), which derives from the processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Mitochondrial dysfunction has been linked to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer´s disease and both Aβ and APP have been reported to affect mitochondrial function in isolated systems. However, in intact cells, considering a physiological localization of APP and Aβ, it is pending what triggers the mitochondrial defect. Thus, the aim of this study was to dissect the impact of APP versus Aβ in inducing mitochondrial alterations with respect to their subcellular localization. We performed an overexpression of APP or beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), increasing APP and Aβ levels or Aβ alone, respectively. Conducting a comprehensive metabolic characterization we demonstrate that only APP overexpression reduced mitochondrial respiration, despite lower extracellular Aβ levels compared to BACE overexpression. Surprisingly, this could be rescued by a gamma secretase inhibitor, oppositionally indicating an Aβ-mediated mitochondrial toxicity. Analyzing Aβ localization revealed that intracellular levels of Aβ and an increased spatial association of APP/Aβ with mitochondria are associated with reduced mitochondrial respiration. Thus, our data provide marked evidence for a prominent role of intracellular Aβ accumulation in Alzheimer´s disease associated mitochondrial dysfunction. Thereby it highlights the importance of the localization of APP processing and intracellular transport as a decisive factor for mitochondrial function, linking two prominent hallmarks of neurodegenerative diseases.","1932-6203","PloS one","(11) e0168157",2016,"Patrick M","Schaefer","PM","Institute of Neurology, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany."

The autophagy-lysosomal system plays a key role in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis in neurons. Recent studies established that nascent autophagosomes in distal axons move predominantly in the retrograde direction toward the soma, where mature lysosomes are mainly located. However, it remains unknown whether autophagy plays a critical role in regulation of BACE1 trafficking and degradation. Here, we report that induction of neuronal autophagy enhances BACE1 turnover, which is suppressed by lysosomal inhibition. A significant portion of BACE1 is recruited to the autophagy pathway and co-migrates robustly with autophagic vacuoles along axons. Moreover, we reveal that autophagic vacuole-associated BACE1 is accumulated in the distal axon of Alzheimer's disease-related mutant human APP transgenic neurons and mouse brains. Inducing autophagy in mutant human APP neurons augments autophagic retention of BACE1 in distal axons, leading to enhanced β-cleavage of APP. This phenotype can be reversed by Snapin-enhanced retrograde transport, which facilitates BACE1 trafficking to lysosomes for degradation. Therefore, our study provides new insights into autophagy-mediated regulation of BACE1 turnover and APP processing, thus building a foundation for future development of potential Alzheimer's disease therapeutic strategies.","1083-351X","The Journal of biological chemistry","(292) 1679-1690",2017,"Tuancheng","Feng","T","From the Department of Cell Biology and Neuroscience, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, Piscataway, New Jersey 08854."

Although genetic deletion of BACE1 results in abolished amyloid pathology in AD model mice, it also results in neurodevelopmental phenotypes such as hypomyelination and synaptic loss, observed in schizophrenia and autism-like phenotype. These lines of evidence indicate that the inhibition of BACE1 causes adverse side effects during the neurodevelopmental stage. However, the effects of the inhibition of BACE1 activity on already developed neurons remain unclear. Here, we utilized hippocampal slice cultures as an ex vivo model that enabled continuous and long-term analysis for the effect of BACE1 inhibition on neuronal circuits and synapses. Temporal changes in synaptic proteins in hippocampal slices indicated acute synaptic loss, followed by synapse formation and maintenance phases. Long-term BACE1 inhibition in the neurodevelopmental stage caused the loss of synaptic proteins but failed to alter synaptic proteins in the already developed maintenance stage. These data indicate that BACE1 function on synapses is dependent on synaptic developmental stages, and our study provides a useful model to observe the long-term effect of BACE1 activity in the brain, and to evaluate adverse effects of BACE inhibitors.","1875-8908","Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD","(56) 641-653",2017,"Yuji","Kamikubo","Y",""

Though amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP) primes the pathological cascade, changes in cholesterol levels and its intermediates, geranyl geranyl pyrophosphate and farnesyl pyrophosphate, is expected to have a different consequence on AβPP processing and amyloid-β (Aβ) generation. However, the use of statins (HMG-COA reductase inhibitor) has been widely implicated in slowing down the pathogenic progression of AD, while the epidemiological reports on its biological effect remains controversial. Considering this fact, the choice of drug that could maintain cholesterol homeostasis without altering its biosynthesis may yield a better therapeutic efficacy on AD. Thus, the present study focused on determining the influence of cholesterol and isoprenoids on amyloidogenic-cleavage of AβPP, in addition to resveratrol as a potent therapeutic drug in CHO-APPswe cell lines. High levels of cholesterol were found to enhance the maturation of AβPP and altered the expression and subcellular localization of ADAM10, BACE1, and PS1 thereby promoting Aβ generation, whereas high isoprenoids increased both maturation as well as amyloidogenic-cleavage of AβPP, which was evident through β-CTF production. Interestingly, the therapeutic efficacy of resveratrol maintained cholesterol homeostasis and reduced the amyloidogenic burden through its ability to enhance SIRT1 expression and thereby regulating differential expression of AD determinants.","1875-8908","Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD","(60) S3-S23",2017,"Mohan","Sathya","M","Molecular Gerontology Laboratory, Department of Biochemistry, Bharathidasan University, Tiruchirappalli, Tamilnadu, India."

Thus, the dynamics of cerebral Aβ, called as ""Aβ economy"", would be the mechanistic basis of AD pathogenesis. Partial loss of γ-secretase activity leads to the increased generation of toxic Aβ isoforms, indicating that activation of γ-secretase would provide a beneficial effect for AD. After extensive discovery and development efforts, BACE1, which is a β-secretase enzyme, has emerged as a prime drug target for lowering brain Aβ levels. Recent studies revealed the decreased clearance of Aβ in sporadic AD patients, suggesting the importance of the catabolic mechanism in the pathogenesis of AD.

However, the mechanism underlying this phenomenon remains incompletely elucidated. In this study, we demonstrated that treatment with the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α disrupted vascular endothelial cell-cell tight junctions and promoted monocyte endothelial cell adhesion.

Further analysis demonstrated that TNF-α treatment upregulated β-site amyloid precursor protein enzyme 1 (BACE1) expression, thus resulting in sequential ST6Gal-I proteolytic degradation. Furthermore, our results revealed that PKC signaling cascades were involved in TNF-α-induced BACE1 upregulation. Together, these results indicated that the proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α impairs endothelial tight junctions and promotes monocyte-endothelial cell adhesion by upregulating BACE1 expression through activating PKC signaling and sequentially cleaving ST6Gal-I.

Clinically, TA has strong antioxidant/free radical scavenging, antiinflammatory, anti-viral/bacterial, and anti-carcinogenic properties. While the aetiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unclear, this complex multifactorial neurodegenerative disorder remains the most common form of dementia, and is a growing public health concern worldwide. The neuroprotective effects of TA against AD have been shown in several in vitro and in vivo models of AD. Apart from its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory roles, evidence suggests that TA is also a natural inhibitor of β-secretase (BACE1) activity and protein expression. BACE1 is the primary enzyme responsible for the production and deposition of Aβ peptide. TA also destabilises neurotoxic amyloid beta (Aβ) fibrils in vitro. Apart from its effects on the Aβ cascade, TA can also inhibit the in vitro aggregation of tau peptide, a core component of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). This review summarizes the relevance of TA and TA-related vegetable extracts (tannins) in the pathogenesis of AD and its enzymatic targets.

However, BACE1 is also required for proper myelination of peripheral nerves, as BACE1-null mice display hypomyelination. To determine the precise effects of BACE1 on myelination, here we have uncovered a role of BACE1 in the control of Schwann cell proliferation during development. We demonstrate that BACE1 regulates the cleavage of Jagged-1 and Delta-1, two membrane-bound ligands of Notch. BACE1 deficiency induces elevated Jag-Notch signaling activity, which in turn facilitates proliferation of Schwann cells. This increase in proliferation leads to shortened internodes and decreased Schmidt-Lanterman incisures. Functionally, evoked compound action potentials in BACE1-null nerves were significantly smaller and slower, with a clear decrease in excitability. BACE1-null nerves failed to effectively use lactate as an alternative energy source under conditions of increased physiological activity. Correlatively, BACE1-null mice showed reduced performance on rotarod tests. Collectively, our data suggest that BACE1 deficiency enhances proliferation of Schwann cell due to the elevated Jag1/Delta1-Notch signaling, but fails to myelinate axons efficiently due to impaired the neuregulin1-ErbB signaling, which has been documented.","1098-1136","Glia","(65) 712-726",2017,"Xiangyou","Hu","X","Department of Neurosciences, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, Ohio, 44195."

The main aim of this study was to assess the influence of subchronic (28-fold) administration of Salvia miltiorrhiza root extract (SE, 200mg/kg, p.o.) on behavioural activity and memory of rats and to evaluate the activities of cholinesterases (AChE and BuChE) and gene expression levels of AChE and BuChE as well as of beta-secretase (BACE1) in the hippocampus and frontal cortex in vivo.

The results showed that subchronic administration of SE led to an improvement of long-term memory of rats. Strong inhibition of AChE and BuChE mRNA transcription in the frontal cortex of rats treated with SE or HU was observed. The BACE1 transcript level was significantly decreased. AChE activity was statistically significantly inhibited in the frontal cortex and the hippocampus by SE (47% and 55%, respectively). Similar effects were observed in the case of HU.

Despite their prominence in AD pathogenesis, the regulation of BACE1 and APP is incompletely understood. In this study, we report that the circular RNA circular RNA sponge for miR-7 (ciRS-7) has an important role in regulating BACE1 and APP protein levels. Previous studies have shown that ciRS-7, which is highly expressed in the human brain, is down-regulated in the brain of people with AD but the relevance of this finding was not clear. We have found that ciRS-7 is not involved in the regulation of APP and BACE1 gene expression, but instead reduces the protein levels of APP and BACE1 by promoting their degradation via the proteasome and lysosome. Consequently, overexpression of ciRS-7 reduces the generation of Aβ, indicating a potential neuroprotective role of ciRS-7. Our data also suggest that ciRS-7 modulates APP and BACE1 levels in a nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-dependent manner: ciRS-7 expression inhibits translation of NF-κB and induces its cytoplasmic localization, thus derepressing expression of UCHL1, which promotes APP and BACE1 degradation. Additionally, we demonstrated that APP reduces the level of ciRS-7, revealing a mutual regulation of ciRS-7 and APP. Taken together, our data provide a molecular mechanism implicating reduced ciRS-7 expression in AD, suggesting that ciRS-7 may represent a useful target in the development of therapeutic strategies for AD.","1742-4658","The FEBS journal","(284) 1096-1109",2017,"Zhemin","Shi","Z","Department of Histology and Embryology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Tianjin Medical University, China."

Amyloid β-protein (Aβ), which plays a central role in AD pathogenesis, is reported to accumulate within mitochondria. However, a question remains as to whether Aβ is generated locally from amyloid precursor protein (APP) within mitochondria. We investigated this issue by analyzing the expression patterns of APP, APP-processing secretases, and APP metabolites in mitochondria separated from human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells and those expressing Swedish mutant APP. APP, BACE1, and PEN-2 protein levels were significantly lower in crude mitochondria than microsome fractions while those of ADAM10 and the other γ-secretase complex components (presenilin 1, nicastrin, and APH-1) were comparable between fractions. The crude mitochondrial fraction containing substantial levels of cathepsin D, a lysosomal marker, was further separated via iodixanol gradient centrifugation to obtain mitochondria- and lysosome-enriched fractions. Mature APP, BACE1, and all γ-secretase complex components (in particular, presenilin 1 and PEN-2) were scarcely present in the mitochondria-enriched fraction, compared to the lysosome-enriched fraction. Moreover, expression of the β-C-terminal fragment (β-CTF) of APP was markedly low in the mitochondria-enriched fraction. Additionally, immunocytochemical analysis showed very little co-localization between presenilin 1 and Tom20, a marker protein of mitochondria. In view of the particularly low expression levels of BACE1, γ-secretase complex proteins, and β-CTF in mitochondria, we propose that it is unlikely that Aβ generation from APP occurs locally within this organelle.","1090-2104","Biochemical and biophysical research communications","(486) 321-328",2017,"Naomi","Mamada","N","Department of Demyelinating Disease and Aging, National Institute of Neuroscience, NCNP, Kodaira, Tokyo 187-8502, Japan; Department of Neurology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8575, Japan.

In particular, high plasma levels of the sFFA palmitic acid (palmitate) were shown to inversely correlate with cognitive function. However, the cellular mechanisms by which sFFA may increase the risk for AD are not well known. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress has emerged as one of the signaling pathways initiating and fostering the neurodegenerative changes in AD by increasing the aspartyl protease β-site AβPP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and amyloid-β (Aβ) genesis. In this study, we determined the extent to which palmitate increases BACE1 and Aβ levels in vitro and in vivo as well as the potential role of ER stress as cellular mechanism underlying palmitate effects. We demonstrate, in palmitate-treated SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells and in the hippocampi of palmitate-enriched diet-fed mice, that palmitate evokes the activation of the C/EBP Homologous Protein (CHOP), a transcription factor that is specifically responsive to ER stress. Induction of CHOP expression is associated with increased BACE1 mRNA, protein and activity levels, and subsequent enhanced amyloidogenic processing of amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP) that culminates in a substantial increase in Aβ genesis. We further show that CHOP is an indispensable molecular mediator of palmitate-induced upregulation in BACE1 activity and Aβ genesis. Indeed, we show that Chop-/- mice and CHOP knocked-down SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells do not exhibit the same commensurate degree of palmitate-induced increase in BACE1 expression levels and Aβ genesis.","1875-8908","Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD","(57) 907-925",2017,"Gurdeep","Marwarha","G",""

C99 is subsequently cleaved to amyloid β (Aβ), the aggregation of which is known to cause Alzheimer's disease. Therefore, C99 removing is for preventing the disease. Selenoprotein S (SelS) is an ER membrane protein participating in endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD), one of the stages in resolving ER stress of misfolded proteins accumulated in the ER. ERAD has been postulated as one of the processes to degrade C99; however, it remains unclear if the degradation depends on SelS. In this study, we investigated the effect of SelS on C99 degradation. We observed that both SelS and C99 were colocalized in the membrane fraction of mouse neuroblastoma Neuro2a (N2a) cells. While the level of SelS was increased by ER stress, the level of C99 was decreased. However, despite the induction of ER stress, there was no change in the amount of C99 in SelS knock-down cells.

We have established conditions by which human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived sensory neurons can be cultured with rat Schwann cells, and have produced for the first time long-term and stable myelinating co-cultures with human neurons. These cultures contain the specialized domains formed by axonal interaction with myelinating Schwann cells, such as clustered voltage-gated sodium channels at the node of Ranvier and Shaker-type potassium channel (Kv1.2) at the juxtaparanode. Expression of type III neuregulin-1 (TIIINRG1) in induced pluripotent stem cell-derived sensory neurons strongly enhances myelination, while conversely pharmacological blockade of the NRG1-ErbB pathway prevents myelination, providing direct evidence for the ability of this pathway to promote the myelination of human sensory axons. The β-secretase, BACE1 is a protease needed to generate active NRG1 from the full-length form. Due to the fact that it also cleaves amyloid precursor protein, BACE1 is a therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease, however, consistent with its role in NRG1 processing we find that BACE1 inhibition significantly impairs myelination in our co-culture system. In order to exploit co-cultures to address other clinically relevant problems, they were exposed to anti-disialosyl ganglioside antibodies, including those derived from a patient with a sensory predominant, inflammatory neuropathy with mixed axonal and demyelinating electrophysiology. The co-cultures reveal that both mouse and human disialosyl antibodies target the nodal axolemma, induce acute axonal degeneration in the presence of complement, and impair myelination. The human, neuropathy-associated IgM antibody is also shown to induce complement-independent demyelination. Myelinating co-cultures using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived sensory neurons thus provide insights into the cellular and molecular specialization of axoglial signalling, how pharmacological agents may promote or impede such signalling and the pathogenic effects of ganglioside antibodies.awx012media15372351982001.","1460-2156","Brain : a journal of neurology","(140) 898-913",2017,"Alex J","Clark","AJ","Nuffield Department of Clinical Neurosciences, West Wing, John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford, UK."

Here, we investigate the conformational dynamics and protonation states of BACE1 and CatD using continuous constant pH molecular dynamics with pH replica-exchange sampling protocol. Despite similar structure, BACE1 and CatD exhibit markedly different active site dynamics. BACE1 displays pH-dependent flap dynamics that controls substrate accessibility, while the CatD flap is relatively rigid and remains open in the pH range 2.5-6. Interestingly, although each protease hydrolyzes peptide bonds, the protonation states of the catalytic dyads are different within the active pH range.

Aβ is generated from the canonical amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) proteolysis pathway through β- and γ-secretases. Decreasing Aβ levels through targeting APP processing is a very promising direction in clinical trials for AD. A novel APP processing pathway was recently identified, in which η-secretase processing of APP occurs and results in the generation of the carboxy-terminal fragment-η (CTF-η or η-CTF) (Wang et al., 2015) and Aη-α peptide (Willem et al., 2015). η-Secretase processing of APP may be up-regulated by at least two mechanisms: either through inhibition of lysosomal-cathepsin degradation pathway (Wang et al., 2015) or through inhibition of BACE1 that competes with η-secretase cleavage of APP (Willem et al., 2015). A thorough characterization of η-processing of APP is critical for a better understanding of AD pathogenesis and insights into results of clinical trials of AD. Here we further investigated η-secretase processing of APP using well-characterized cell models of AD. We found that these two mechanisms act synergistically toward increasing η-secretase processing of APP and Aη-α levels. Furthermore, we evaluated the effects of several other known secretase modulators on η-processing of APP.

However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Therefore, this study was performed to clarify how Aβ-related metabolism is regulated after SD. Three-month-old Sprague-Dawley rats (250-300g) were randomly divided into 5 groups: two SD groups(i.e.,SD-2d and SD-4d), two platform control groups(i.e.,PC-2d and PC-4d) and a home cage control group (CC). For the two SD groups, themodified multiple platform method (MMPM) was used to induce SD.Our experiments confirmed that SD impaired cognitive function and increased the levels of Aβ peptides, a hallmark of AD. Additionally, we found that SD significantly increasedthe levels of the β-site amyloid precursor protein (APP)-cleaving enzyme 1(BACE1, β-secretase), but had little impacton the levels of Aβ-degradationenzymes.This resultmay be the main cause of the over-expression of Aβ1-42 and Aβ1-40. Our results suggested that SD accelerates the progression of AD bymodulating Aβ-related metabolism. This findinghasimportant implications for the diagnosis and prevention of AD.","1872-7972","Neuroscience letters","(650) 146-152",2017,"Lihong","Chen","L","Fujian Institute of Chinese Medicine, Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Fujian, 350003, China."
28457944,"Effects of phenothiazine-structured compounds on APP processing in Alzheimer's disease cellular model.","The excess accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides derived from the sequential cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by secretases, is one of the toxic key events leading to neuronal loss in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Studies have shown that cholinergic activity may also be involved in the regulation of APP metabolism. In the current study, we have investigated the roles of toluidine blue O (TBO) and thionine (TH), newly recognized phenothiazine-derived cholinesterase inhibitors, on the metabolism of APP in Chinese hamster ovary cells stably expressing human APP751 and presenilin 1 (PS70 cells). We assessed the effects of both compounds on the levels of Aβ, soluble APP-α (sAPPα), intracellular APP and β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1). After treatment of PS70 cells with TBO or TH without any side effect on cell viability, the levels of secreted Aβ40, Aβ42 and sAPPα were assayed by specific sandwich ELISAs while APP and BACE1 in cell lysates were analyzed using Western blot. The secreted Aβ40, Aβ42 and sAPPα in TBO- and TH-treated cells were found to be reduced in a dose-dependent manner compared to vehicle-treated cells. Results suggest that TH mitigated the Aβ pathology by lowering APP levels whereas reduced Aβ caused by TBO treatment seems to be the outcome of both less substrate availability and amyloidogenic APP processing. Taken together, our results represent the first report demonstrating that TBO and TH can affect amyloid metabolism in vitro.","1638-6183","Biochimie","(138) 82-89",2017,"Melike","Yuksel","M","Department of Biochemistry, School of Pharmacy, Hacettepe University, 06100, Ankara, Turkey.

Here, we investigated the suppressive possibility of ethanol extract of Nannochloropsis oceanica (N. oceanica) on memory deficiency along with the fundamental mechanisms in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated mice model. Among several extracts of 32 marine microalgae, ethanol extract of N. oceanica showed the most significant inhibitory effect on nitric oxide (NO) generation, NF-κB activity and β-secretase activity in cultured BV-2 cells, neuronal cells and Raw 264.7 cells. Ethanol extract of N. oceanica (50, 100 mg/kg) also ameliorated LPS (250 μg/kg)-induced memory impairment. We also found that ethanol extract of N. oceanica inhibited the LPS-induced expression of iNOS and COX-2. Furthermore, the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), malondialdehyde (MDA) level as well as glutathione (GSH) level was also decreased by treatment of ethanol extract of N.oceanica. The ethanol extract of N. oceanica also suppresses IκB degradation as well as p50 and p65 translocation into the nucleus in LPS-treated mice brain. Associated with the inhibitory effect on neuroinflammation and oxidative stress, ethanol extract of N. oceanica suppressed Aβ1-42 generation through down-regulation of APP and BACE1 expression in in vivo.

The β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is essential for Aβ generation and dysregulation of BACE1 expression may lead to AD pathogenesis. Bcl-2-associated athanogen 1M (BAG-1M), initially identified as an anti-apoptotic protein, has also been found to be highly expressed in the same neurons that contain intracellular amyloid in the hippocampus of AD patient. In this report, we found that over-expression of BAG-1M enhances BACE1-mediated cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Aβ production by up-regulating BACE1 gene transcription. The regulation of BACE1 transcription by BAG-1M was dependent on NF-κB, as BAG-1M complexes NF-κB at the promoter of BACE1 gene and co-activates NF-κB-facilitated BACE1 transcription. Moreover, expression of BAG-1M by lentiviral vector in the hippocampus of AD transgenic model mice promotes Aβ generation and formation of neuritic plaque, and subsequently accelerates memory deficits of the mice. These results provide evidence for an emerging role of BAG-1M in the regulation of BACE1 expression and AD pathogenesis and that targeting the BAG-1M-NF-κB complex may provide a mechanism for inhibiting Aβ production and plaque formation.","0925-4439","Biochimica et biophysica acta.

Oxidative stress is one of the principal mediators of the observed neurotoxicity of amyloid fibril. The disease pathogenesis involves induction of multiple signaling cascades and the cross-talk therein. Thus inhibiting multiple targets could be an attractive therapeutic strategy. Here, a multi-target virtual screening protocol has been devised and used to screen an in house developed phytochemical library. Narirutin comes out as a multi-potent phytochemical. Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence along with molecular modelling studies demonstrate its binding to the BACE1 active site that induces a conformational transition of the protein from open to closed form which precludes substrate recognition.

Esteemed published articles and epidemiological data exhibit an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) in diabetic pateints. Metformin is the most frequently used oral anti-diabetic drug, which apart from hypoglycaemic activity, improves serum lipid profiles, positively influences the process of haemostasis, and possesses anti-inflammatory properties. Recently, scientists have put their efforts in establishing metformin's role in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, such as AD, amnestic mild cognitive impairment and Parkinson's disease. Results of several clinical studies confirm that long term use of metformin in diabetic patients contributes to better cognitive function, compared to participants using other anti-diabetic drugs. The exact mechanism of metformin's advantageous activity in AD is not fully understood, but scientists claim that activation of AMPK-dependent pathways in human neural stem cells might be responsible for the neuroprotective activity of metformin. Metformin was also found to markedly decease Beta-secretase 1 (BACE1) protein expression and activity in cell culture models and in vivo, thereby reducing BACE1 cleavage products and the production of Aβ (β-amyloid). Furthermore, there is also some evidence that metformin decreases the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), which is responsible for the degradation of acetylcholine (Ach), a neurotransmitter involved in the process of learning and memory. In regard to the beneficial effects of metformin, its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties cannot be omitted.

Unfortunately, few medicines have succeeded to completely cure AD. Yangxue Qingnao (YXQN) is a Chinese traditional medicine, and its pharmacological effect is improving cerebral blood flow. In this study, we firstly demonstrated that YXQN reduced AD-like pathology and cognitive impairment in APPswePS1dE9 (APP/PS1) mice with 2 months administration. Our data showed that YXQN substantially ameliorated behavioral defects in 10-month old APP/PS1 mice using Morris Water Maze and Y-maze tests, in which the cognitive ability of YXQN high-dose group approaches to wild type mice. Next, we focused on the brain pathological alterations in the YXQN group by three experiments, including thioflavin-S, congo-red, and Aβ-immunohistochemistry staining. The results demonstrated that the high-dose of YXQN dramatically suppressed amyloid plaques in the hippocampus and cortex of APP/PS1 mice, which showed a 47-72% reduction in plaque deposits, relative to the vehicle group. In addition, our data verified that YXQN decreased the cerebral amyloid load by attenuating β-secretase BACE1 and γ-secretase PS1 in the pathological processing of APP, and promoting the level of α-secretase ADAM10 in the physiological processing of APP to generate more sAPPα, which combats amyloidosis formation, and also carries out neurotropic and neuroprotective effect. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that YXQN could be a potential medicine for AD, and provide new evidence for further AD drug research and development.","1663-4365","Frontiers in aging neuroscience","(9) 157",2017,"Xiaowan","Wang","X","The Key Laboratory of Molecular Epigenetics of MOE, Institute of Genetics and Cytology, Northeast Normal UniversityChangchun, China."

In an obese mouse model, a high-fat diet (HFD) significantly increased the expression levels of APP and BACE1 as well as the AD pathology in the mouse brain. We further found that PA conjugated with bovine serum albumin (PA-BSA) increased the expression of APP and BACE1 and the production of Aβ through the G protein-coupled receptor 40 (GPR40) in SK-N-MC cells. PA-BSA coupling with GPR40 significantly induced Akt activation which is required for mTOR/p70S6K1-mediated HIF-1α expression and NF-κB phosphorylation facilitating the transcriptional activity of the APP and BACE1 genes. In addition, silencing of APP and BACE1 expression significantly decreased the production of Aβ in SK-N-MC cells treated with PA-BSA. In conclusion, these results show that extra-cellular PA coupled with GPR40 induces the expression of APP and BACE1 to facilitate Aβ production via the Akt-mTOR-HIF-1α and Akt-NF-κB pathways in SK-N-MC cells.","2045-2322","Scientific reports","(7) 4335",2017,"Jeong Yeon","Kim","JY","Department of Veterinary Physiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Research Institute for Veterinary Science, Seoul National University, Seoul, 08826, Republic of Korea."

In examining BACE1-null mice, we discovered that BACE1 deficiency develops abnormal clusters of immature neurons, forming doublecortin-positive neuroblasts, in the developing dentate gyrus, mainly in the subpial zone (SPZ). Such clusters were rarely observed in wild-type SPZ and not reported in other mouse models. To understand their origins and fates, we examined how neuroblasts in BACE1-null SPZ mature and migrate during early postnatal development. We show that such neuroblasts are destined to form Prox1-positive granule cells in the dentate granule cell layer, and mainly mature to form excitatory neurons, but not inhibitory neurons. Mechanistically, higher levels of reelin potentially contribute to abnormal neurogenesis and timely migration in BACE1-null SPZ. Altogether, we demonstrate that BACE1 is a critical regulator in forming the dentate granule cell layer through timely maturation and migration of SPZ neuroblasts.","2213-6711","Stem cell reports","(9) 217-230",2017,"Hailong","Hou","H","Department of Neurosciences, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, 9500 Euclid Avenue/NC30, Cleveland, OH 44195, USA."

Inhibiting Aβ production and/or enhancing the clearance of Aβ to reduce its levels are still the effective therapeutic strategies pursued in anti-AD research. In previous studies, we have reported that selenomethionine (Se-Met), a major form of selenium in animals and humans with significant antioxidant capacity, can reduce both amyloid-β (Aβ) deposition and tau hyperphosphorylation in a triple transgenic mouse model of AD. In this study, a Se-Met treatment significantly decreased the Aβ levels in Neuron-2a/AβPPswe (N2asw) cells, and the anti-amyloid effect of Se-Met was attributed to its ability to inhibit Aβ generation by suppressing the activity of BACE1. Furthermore, both the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio and the number of LC3-positive puncta were significantly decreased in Se-Met-treated cells, suggesting that Se-Met also promoted Aβ clearance by modulating the autophagy pathway. Subsequently, Se-Met inhibited the initiation of autophagy through the AKT-mTOR-p70S6K signaling pathway and enhanced autophagic turnover by promoting autophagosome-lysosome fusion and autophagic clearance. Our results further highlight the potential therapeutic effects of Se-Met on AD.","1875-8908","Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD","(59) 591-602",2017,"Zhong-Hao","Zhang","ZH","Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Marine Bioresources and Ecology, College of Life Sciences and Oceanography, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, China."

Previously, we showed that genetically knocking out Beta-Site APP-Cleaving Enzyme 1 (BACE1) leads to increased nerve regeneration. Two cellular components, macrophages and neurons, contribute to enhanced nerve regeneration in BACE1 knockout mice. Here, we utilized a transgenic mouse model that overexpresses BACE1 in its neurons to investigate whether neuronal BACE1 has an inverse effect on regeneration following nerve injury. We performed a sciatic nerve crush in BACE1 transgenic mice and control wild-type littermates, and evaluated the extent of both morphological and physiological improvements over time. At the earliest time point of 3days, we observed a significant decrease in the length of axonal sprouts growing out from the crush site in BACE1 transgenic mice. At later times (10 and 15days post-crush), there were significant reductions in the number of myelinated axons in the sciatic nerve and the percentage of re-innervated neuromuscular junctions in the gastrocnemius muscle. Transgenic mice had a functional electrophysiological delay in the recovery up to 8weeks post-crush compared to controls. These results indicate that BACE1 activity levels have an inverse effect on peripheral nerve repair after injury. The results obtained in this study provide evidence that neuronal BACE1 activity levels impact peripheral nerve regeneration. This data has clinical relevance by highlighting a novel drug target to enhance peripheral nerve repair, an area which currently does not have any approved therapeutics.","1095-953X","Neurobiology of disease","(106) 147-157",2017,"Carolyn","Tallon","C","Department of Neurology, Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States."

Availability of BACE1 crystal structures in both apo and complexed forms enables to find structure-based BACE1 inhibitors for controlling AD.

In order to understand the binding mechanism and structure-activity relationship of amidine-containing BACE1 inhibitors, molecular docking, and pharmacophore and 3D-QSAR studies have been carried out with 34 amidine derivatives to develop a pharmacophore model. Pharmacophore-based virtual screening (PBVS) has been performed against BACE1 (PDB ID: 2FDP), using three chemical databases (CoCoCo, Enamine, Zinc), which yielded 6000 hit compounds. These compounds were further analyzed using structure-based docking in hierarchical filtering approaches of Glide such as HTVS, SP, and XP precision modes. The docking results show that binding orientations of the inhibitors at Asp dyad active site amino acid residues of β-Secretase. Results from glide XP docking and induced fit docking showed that four leads (Lead1, Lead3, Lead4 and Lead5) have good interactions with the target protein in comparison with cocrystal (amino-ethylene BACE1 inhibitor). Further, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation for these leads bound with BACE1 shows conformational stability and difference in dynamical flap behaviors of the active site with cocrystal inhibitor.

Sodium selenate has been reported to reduce neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) in the tauopathic mouse models, but its effects on the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and APP processing remain unknown during AD formation. In this paper, triple transgenic AD mice (3×Tg-AD) had been treated with sodium selenate in drinking water for 10month before the detection of hippocampal pathology. Increased Aβ generation, tau hyperphosphorylation and neuronal apoptosis were found in the hippocampus of AD model mouse. Down-regulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling is closely associated with the alteration of AD pathology. Treatment with sodium selenate significantly promoted the activity of protein phosphatases of type 2A (PP2A) and repressed the hallmarks of AD. Activation of PP2A by sodium selenate could increase active β-catenin level and inhibit GSK3β activity in the hippocampal tissue and primarily cultured neurons of AD model mouse, leading to activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling and transactivation of target genes, including positively-regulated genes c-myc, survivin, TXNRD2 and negatively-regulated gene BACE1. Meanwhile, APP phosphorylation was also reduced on the Thr668 residue after selenate treatment, causing the decreases of APP cleavage and Aβ generation. These findings reveal that the Wnt/β-catenin signaling is a potential target for prevention of AD and sodium selenate may be developed as a new drug for AD treatment.","1090-2430","Experimental neurology","(297) 36-49",2017,"Na","Jin","N","College of Life Sciences & Oceanography, Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Marine Biotechnology and Ecology, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen 518060, China."

We employed a multi-structure docking protocol. In which 615 ligands' structures were docked into 150 BACE1 structures. The large number of the resultant docking scores were post-processed by different data analysis methods including exploratory data analysis, regression analysis and discriminant analysis. It was found that using one crystal structure for docking did not result in high accuracy for predicting activity of the BACE1 inhibitors. Instead, using of the multi-structural docking scores, post-processed by chemometrics methods arrived to highly accurate predictive models. In this regards, the PDB accession codes of 4B70, 4DVF and 2WEZ could discriminate between active and inactive compounds, with higher accuracy.

In RTN3-null mice, RTN1 expression was slightly elevated. To understand the in vivo role of RTN1, we generated RTN1-null mice and compared the effects of RTN1 and RTN3 on BACE1 modulation. We show that RTN1 is mostly expressed by neurons and not by glial cells under normal conditions, similar to the expression of RTN3. However, RTN1 is more localized in dendrites and is an excellent marker for dendrites of Purkinje cells, while RTN3 expression is less evident in dendrites. This differential localization also correlates with their associations with amyloid plaques in Alzheimer's brains: RTN3, but not RTN1, is abundantly enriched in dystrophic neurites. RTN3 deficiency causes elevation of BACE1 protein levels, while RTN1 deficiency shows no obvious effects on BACE1 activity due to compensation by RTN3, as RTN1 deficiency causes elevation of RTN3 expression. Hence, expression of RTN1 and RTN3 is tightly regulated in mouse brains. Together, our data show that RTN1 and RTN3 have differential effects on the formation of senile plaques in Alzheimer's brains and that RTN3 has a more prominent role in Alzheimer's pathogenesis.","2045-2322","Scientific reports","(7) 6145",2017,"Qi","Shi","Q","Department of Neurosciences, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, 44195, USA."

28746905,"A PM7 dynamic residue-ligand interactions energy landscape of the BACE1 inhibitory pathway by hydroxyethylamine compounds. Part I: The flap closure process.","BACE1 is an enzyme of scientific interest because it participates in the progression of Alzheimer's disease. Hydroxyethylamines (HEAs) are a family of compounds which exhibit inhibitory activity toward BACE1 at a nanomolar level, favorable pharmacokinetic properties and oral bioavailability. The first step in the inhibition of BACE1 by HEAs consists of their entrance into the protease active site and the resultant conformational change in the protein, from Apo to closed form. These two conformations differ in the position of an antiparallel loop (called the flap) which covers the entrance to the catalytic site. For BACE1, closure of this flap is vital to its catalytic activity and to inhibition of the enzyme due to the new interactions thereby formed with the ligand. In the present study a dynamic energy landscape of residue-ligand interaction energies (ReLIE) measured for 112 amino acids in the BACE1 active site and its immediate vicinity during the closure of the flap induced by 8 HEAs of different inhibitory power is presented. A total of 6.272 million ReLIE calculations, based on the PM7 semiempirical method, provided a deep and quantitative view of the first step in the inhibition of the aspartyl protease. The information suggests that residues Asp93, Asp289, Thr292, Thr293, Asn294 and Arg296 are anchor points for the ligand, accounting for approximately 45% of the total protein-ligand interaction. Additionally, flap closure improved the BACE1-HEA interaction by around 25%. Furthermore, the inhibitory activity of HEAs could be related to the capacity of these ligands to form said anchor point interactions and maintain them over time: the lack of some of these anchor interactions delayed flap closure or impeded it completely, or even caused the flap to reopen. The methodology employed here could be used as a tool to evaluate future structural modifications which lead to improvements in the favorability and stability of BACE1-HEA ReLIEs, aiding in the design of better inhibitors.","1873-4243","Journal of molecular graphics & modelling","(76) 274-288",2017,"Carlos","Gueto-Tettay","C","Grupo de Química Bioorgánica, Facultad de Ciencias Exactas y Naturales, Universidad de Cartagena, Cartagena, Colombia.

These swellings contain high levels of amyloid precursor protein processing enzymes (BACE1 and presenilin 2) and are accompanied by elevated Aβ peptide levels.

Although evidence exists to suggest that peripheral olfactory organs are involved in the olfactory dysfunction that accompanies AD pathology, the underlying mechanisms are not fully understood. As confirmed using behavioral tests, transgenic mice overexpressing a Swedish mutant form of human amyloid precursor proteins exhibited olfactory impairments prior to evidence of cognitive impairment. By measuring the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase, we observed that specific regions of the olfactory bulb (OB) in Tg2576 mice, specifically the ventral portion exhibited significant decreases in the number of dopaminergic neurons in the periglomerular regions from the early stage of AD. To confirm the direct linkage between these olfactory impairments and AD-related pathology, β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1)-the initiating enzyme in Aβ genesis-and β-amyloid peptide (Aβ), hallmarks of AD were analyzed. We found that an increase in BACE1 expression coincided with an elevation of amyloid-β (Aβ) oligomers in the ventral region of OB. Moreover, olfactory epithelium (OE), in particular the ectoturbinate in which axons of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) have direct connections with the dendrites of mitral/tufted cells in the ventral part of OB, exhibited significant decreases in both thickness and cell number even at early stages. This result suggests that Aβ oligomer toxicity in the OE may have induced a decline in the number of OSNs and functional impairment of the olfactory system. We first demonstrated that disproportionate levels of regional damage in the peripheral olfactory system may be a specific symptom of AD with Aβ oligomer accumulation occurring prior to damage within the CNS. This regional damage in the olfactory system early in the progression of AD may be closely related to AD-related pathological abnormality and olfactory dysfunction found in AD patients.","2041-4889","Cell death & disease","(8) e2977",2017,"Seung-Jun","Yoo","SJ","Department of Brain and Cognitive Sciences, Graduate School, Daegu Gyeungbuk Institute of Science and Technology, Daegu, Korea."

High ethanol exposure increased the levels of APP and beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and significantly promoted amyloid β protein (Aβ) production both in vitro and in vivo. The upregulated APP and BACE1 expressions upon ethanol treatment were at least partially due to the activation of APP and BACE1 transcriptions.

Stereological analysis of cortex and hippocampus plaque load similarly revealed significantly reduced area of Aβ immunoreactivity and reduced plaque number in verubecestat-treated animals compared to controls. The absence of elevated ARIA events in verubecestat-treated mice was associated with a significant reduction in the level of accumulated CNS amyloid pathology and brain Aβ peptides; effects consistent with the desired therapeutic mechanism of verubecestat in AD patients.

28814391,"Filling the void: a role for exercise-induced BDNF and brain amyloid precursor protein processing.","Inactivity, obesity, and insulin resistance are significant risk factors for the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Several studies have demonstrated that diet-induced obesity, inactivity, and insulin resistance exacerbate the neuropathological hallmarks of AD. The aggregation of β-amyloid peptides is one of these hallmarks. β-Site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is the rate-limiting enzyme in amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing, leading to β-amyloid peptide formation. Understanding how BACE1 content and activity are regulated is essential for establishing therapies aimed at reducing and/or slowing the progression of AD. Exercise training has been proven to reduce the risk of AD as well as decrease β-amyloid production and BACE1 content and/or activity. However, these long-term interventions also result in improvements in adiposity, circulating metabolites, glucose tolerance, and insulin sensitivity making it difficult to determine the direct effects of exercise on brain APP processing. This review highlights this large void in our knowledge and discusses our current understanding of the direct of effect of exercise on β-amyloid production. We have concentrated on the central role that brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) may play in mediating the direct effects of exercise on reducing brain BACE1 content and activity as well as β-amyloid production. Future studies should aim to generate a greater understanding of how obesity and exercise can directly alter APP processing and AD-related pathologies. This knowledge could provide evidence-based hypotheses for designing therapies to reduce the risk of AD and dementia.","1522-1490","American journal of physiology.

No known mutations are identified in the gene encoding BACE1 in AD. However, enzyme levels are elevated in AD and a single residue mutation in amyloid precursor protein protects against protein cleavage by BACE1, suggesting BACE involvement in disease pathogenesis. Drugs that can inhibit BACE1 would theoretically prevent Aβ accumulation and halt AD onset and progression. Areas covered: This review discusses clinical developments of BACE1 inhibitors and focuses on what is learned about these inhibitors as a potential treatment. Expert opinion: BACE1 inhibition as a therapeutic strategy to improve cognition in AD has been challening. Brain-penetrant BACE1 inhibitors have been developed and clinical trials are underway, both safety and efficacy are questionable. Several clinical trials suggest that BACE1 inhibition and other immunotherapies to reduce brain Aβ are insufficient to improve cognition in AD. This may be due to the emphasis on the amyloid hypothesis despite big failures. We may have to seriously consider shifting attention to therapeutic strategies other than BACE1 inhibition or reduction of Aβ alone and pay more attention to simultaneous clearance of tau and Aβ.","1744-7658","Expert opinion on investigational drugs","(26) 1131-1136",2017,"Charbel E-H","Moussa","CE","a Department of Neurology, Laboratory for Dementia and Parkinsonism, Translational Neurotherapeutics Program , Georgetown University Medical Center , Washington , DC , USA."

Excessive amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide aggregates and forms soluble oligomers and insoluble cerebral amyloid plaques, which is widely thought to be the underlying pathogenic mechanism of AD. Therefore, effective regulation of Aβ metabolism is an important aspect of preventing and improving AD. Berberine, which is the main active component of the traditional medicinal herb Coptidis rhizoma, has a positive effect on reducing Aβ levels. However, the exact mechanism involved is unclear and requires more investigation. In the present study, we examined the role of berberine in the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in neuroblastoma cells and primary cultured neurons and sought to characterize the role of AMPK in the metabolism of Aβ. The results indicate that berberine reduces Aβ generation and decreases the expression of β-site APP cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE1) via activating AMPK in N2a mouse neuroblastoma cells stably expressing human Swedish mutant APP695 (N2a/APP695sw), N2a cells, and primary cultured cortical neurons.

A rat model of CCH has been developed with permanent bilateral occlusion of common carotid arteries (BCCAO). The cognitive function of rats was tested by the Morris water maze. The levels of Aβ (Aβ40 and Aβ42) and soluble amyloid precursor protein (sAPP: sAPPα and sAPPβ) were determined by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay.

Morris water maze test showed that CCH induced decline in learning and memory related to Aβ levels in the hippocampus. The levels of sAPPα, ADAM10 and ADAM17 in the hippocampus of CCH rats were higher than the control ones (P < 0.05); the levels of sAPPβ, BACE and BACE1 increased more than the control ones (P < 0.05). CCH intervention (1-week or 4-week) markedly increased the expression of PS1, Aph-1α and Pen-2 in the hippocampus of rats, but had no effect on NCT. CCH contributed to cognitive impairment and altered the amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic pathway of APP processing by boosting the activity of β-secretase/γ-secretase and α-secretase respectively.

Here, we investigated the effect of the nongenomic pathway induced by glucocorticoid on amyloid precursor protein processing enzymes as well as Aβ production using male ICR mice and human neuroblastoma SK-N-MC cells. Mice groups exposed to restraint stress or intracerebroventricular injection of Aβ showed impaired cognition, decreased intracellular glucocorticoid receptor (GR) level, but elevated level of membrane GR (mGR). In this respect, we identified the mGR-dependent pathway evoked by glucocorticoid using impermeable cortisol conjugated to BSA (cortisol-BSA) on SK-N-MC cells. Cortisol-BSA augmented the expression of β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), the level of C-terminal fragment β of amyloid precursor protein (C99) and Aβ production, which were maintained even after blocking intracellular GR. We also found that cortisol-BSA enhanced the interaction between mGR and Gαs, which colocalized in the lipid raft. The subsequently activated CREB by cortisol-BSA bound to the CRE site of the BACE1 promoter increasing its expression, which was downregulated by inhibiting CBP. Consistently, blocking CBP attenuated cognitive impairment and Aβ production induced by corticosterone treatment or intracerebroventricular injection of Aβ more efficiently than inhibiting intracellular GR in mice. In conclusion, glucocorticoid couples mGR with Gαs and triggers cAMP-PKA-CREB axis dependent on the lipid raft to stimulate BACE1 upregulation and Aβ generation.","1529-2401","The Journal of neuroscience : the official journal of the Society for Neuroscience","(37) 8459-8476",2017,"Gee Euhn","Choi","GE","Department of Veterinary Physiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Research Institute for Veterinary Science and BK21 PLUS Program for Creative Veterinary Research Center, Seoul National University, Seoul 08826, Korea, and."

The expression of p75 neurotrophin receptor is elevated in the brain of AD patients, suggesting its involvement in this disease. However, the exact mechanism of its action is not yet clear. Here, we show that p75 interacts with beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE1), and this interaction is enhanced in the presence of Aβ. Our results suggest that the colocalization of BACE1 and amyloid precursor protein (APP) is increased in the presence of both Aβ and p75 in cortical neurons. In addition, the localization of APP and BACE1 in early endosomes is increased in the presence of Aβ and p75. An increased phosphorylation of APP-Thr668 and BACE1-Ser498 by c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) in the presence of Aβ and p75 could be responsible for this localization.

However, the effect of GLP-1 on cognitive impairment associated with type 2 diabetes is not well known. This study investigated the effect of GLP-1 on ameliorating memory deficits in type 2 diabetic rats. MATERIAL AND METHODS Type 2 diabetic rats were induced by a high-sugar, high-fat diet, followed by streptozotocin (STZ) injection and then tested in the Morris Water Maze (MWM) 1 week after the induction of diabetes. The mRNA expression of Arc, APP, BACE1, and PS1 were determined by real-time quantitative PCR, and the Arc protein was analyzed by immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS Type 2 diabetic rats exhibited a significant decline in learning and memory in the MWM tests, but GLP-1 treatment was able to protect this decline and significantly improved learning ability and memory. The mRNA expression assays showed that GLP-1 treatment markedly reduced Arc, APP, BACE1, and PS1 expressions, which were elevated in the diabetic rats. Immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry results also confirmed that Arc protein increased in the hippocampus of diabetic rats, but was reduced after GLP-1 treatment. CONCLUSIONS Our findings suggest that GLP-1 treatment improves learning and memory deficits in type 2 diabetic rats, and this effect is likely through the reduction of Arc expression in the hippocampus.","1643-3750","Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research","(23) 4334-4342",2017,"Xiang-Sheng","Cai","XS","School of Biotechnology, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China (mainland)."

Hence, approaches aiming at APP processing and Aβ metabolism are currently being actively pursued for the management of AD. Studies suggest that high cholesterol and a high fat diet have harmful effects on cognitive function and may instigate the commencement of AD pathogenesis. Despite the neuropharmacological attributes of black cumin seed (Nigella sativa) extracts and its main active compound, thymoquinone (TQ), limited records are available in relation to AD research. Nanoemulsion (NE) is exploited as drug delivery systems due to their capacity of solubilising non-polar active compounds and is widely examined for brain targeting. Herewith, the effects of thymoquinone-rich fraction nanoemulsion (TQRFNE), thymoquinone nanoemulsion (TQNE) and their counterparts' conventional emulsion in response to high fat/cholesterol diet (HFCD)-induced rats were investigated. Particularly, the Aβ generation; APP processing, β-secretase 1 (BACE1), γ-secretases of presenilin 1 (PSEN1) and presenilin 2 (PSEN2), Aβ degradation; insulin degrading enzyme (IDE), Aβ transportation; low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) and receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) were measured in brain tissues. TQRFNE reduced the brain Aβ fragment length 1-40 and 1-42 (Aβ40 and Aβ42) levels, which would attenuate the AD pathogenesis. This reduction could be due to the modulation of β- and γ-secretase enzyme activity, and the Aβ degradation and transportation in/out of the brain. The findings show the mechanistic actions of TQRFNE in response to high fat and high cholesterol diet associated to Aβ generation, degradation and transportation in the rat's brain tissue.","1950-6007","Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie","(95) 780-788",2017,"Norsharina","Ismail","N","Nutricosmeceuticals and Nutrigenomics Programme, Laboratory of Molecular Biomedicine, Institute of Bioscience, Universiti Putra Malaysia, 43400 UPM Serdang, Selangor, Malaysia.

The calculations predicted identical affinity for BACE1 and the closely related cathepsin D at high pH; however, at pH 4.6 the inhibitor is selective for BACE1 by 1.3 kcal/mol, in excellent agreement with experiment. Surprisingly, the pH-dependent selectivity can be attributed to the protonation of His45, which allosterically modulates a loop-inhibitor interaction.

In AD brains, BACE1 is abnormally accumulated in endocytic compartments, where the acidic pH is optimal for its activity. However, mechanisms regulating the endosome-to-trans-Golgi network (TGN) retrieval of BACE1 remain unclear. Here, we show that partitioning defective 3 (Par3) facilitates BACE1 retrograde trafficking from endosomes to the TGN. Par3 functions through aPKC-mediated phosphorylation of BACE1 on Ser498, which in turn promotes the interaction between BACE1 and phosphofurin acidic cluster sorting protein 1 and facilitates the retrograde trafficking of BACE1 to the TGN. In human AD brains, there is a significant decrease in Ser498 phosphorylation of BACE1 suggesting that defective phosphorylation-dependent retrograde transport of BACE1 is important in AD pathogenesis.

In the present study, we reported that severe deficits in spatial learning and memory were observed in APP23/PS45 double transgenic mice, a well known mouse model of AD. Furthermore, these behavioral changes were accompanied by the impairment of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the CA1 region of hippocampus, a brain region vital to spatial learning and memory. More importantly, 2-week low-frequency rTMS treatment markedly reversed the impairment of spatial learning and memory as well as hippocampal CA1 LTP. In addition, low-frequency rTMS dramatically reduced amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) and its C-terminal fragments (CTFs) including C99 and C89, as well as β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) in the hippocampus. These results indicate that low-frequency rTMS noninvasively and effectively ameliorates cognitive and synaptic functions in a mouse model of AD, and the potential mechanisms may be attributed to rTMS-induced reduction in Aβ neuropathology.","1663-4365","Frontiers in aging neuroscience","(9) 292",2017,"Zhilin","Huang","Z","Ministry of Education Key Laboratory of Child Development and Disorders, Children's Hospital of Chongqing Medical UniversityChongqing, China."

Exploiting a nutritional B-vitamin deficiency paradigm, we have previously shown that PSEN1 and BACE1 activity is modulated by one-carbon metabolism, leading to increased amyloid production. We have also demonstrated that S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) supplementation contrasted the AD-like features, induced by B-vitamin deficiency. In the present study, we expanded these observations by investigating the effects of SAM and SOD (Superoxide dismutase) association. TgCRND8 AD mice were fed either with a control or B-vitamin deficient diet, with or without oral supplementation of SAM + SOD. We measured oxidative stress by lipid peroxidation assay, PSEN1 and BACE1 expression by Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), amyloid deposition by ELISA assays and immunohistochemistry. We found that SAM + SOD supplementation prevents the exacerbation of AD-like features induced by B vitamin deficiency, showing synergistic effects compared to either SAM or SOD alone. SAM + SOD supplementation also contrasts the amyloid deposition typically observed in TgCRND8 mice. Although the mechanisms underlying the beneficial effect of exogenous SOD remain to be elucidated, our findings identify that the combination of SAM + SOD could be carefully considered as co-adjuvant of current AD therapies.","2076-3921","Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)","E76",2017,"Rosaria A","Cavallaro","RA","Department of Surgery ""P.

Recent studies have shown that Neuregulin-1 (Nrg1) is a candidate gene for schizophrenia. At least 15 alternative splicing of NRG1 isoforms all contain an extracellular epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domain, which is sufficient for Nrg1 biological activity including the formation of myelin sheaths and the regulation of synaptic plasticity. It is known that Nrg1 can be cleaved by β-secretase (BACE1) and the resulting N-terminal fragment (Nrg1-ntf) binds to receptor tyrosine kinase ErbB4, which activates Nrg1/ErbB4 signaling. While changes in Nrg1 expression levels in schizophrenia still remain controversial, understanding the BACE1-cleaved Nrg1-ntf and Nrg1/ErbB4 signaling in schizophrenia neuropathogenesis is essential and important. In this review paper, we included three major parts: (1) Nrg1 structure and cleavage pattern by BACE1; (2) BACE1-dependent Nrg1 cleavage associated with schizophrenia in human studies; and (3) Animal studies of Nrg1 and BACE1 mutations with behavioral observations.

Among the many pathologic events observed in the progression of AD, changes in amyloid β peptide (Aβ) metabolism proceed fastest, and precede clinical symptoms. BACE1 (β-secretase 1) catalyzes the initial cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein to generate Aβ. Therefore inhibition of BACE1 activity could block one of the earliest pathologic events in AD. However, therapeutic BACE1 inhibition to block Aβ production may need to be balanced with possible effects that might result from diminished physiologic functions BACE1, in particular processing of substrates involved in neuronal function of the brain and periphery. Potentials for beneficial or consequential effects resulting from pharmacologic inhibition of BACE1 are reviewed in context of ongoing clinical trials testing the effect of BACE1 candidate inhibitor drugs in AD populations.","1420-3049","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)","E1723",2017,"Gerald","Koelsch","G","CoMentis, Inc., South San Francisco, CA 94080, USA. geraldkoelschcomentis@gmail.com."

These mixed neurological disorders not only include structural AD brain changes but also cerebrovascular lesions. The main aim of the present issue is to find the factors shared by the two pathologies. The decrease of ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (Uch-L1), a major neuronal enzyme involved in the elimination of misfolded proteins, was observed in ischemic injury as well as in AD, but its role in the pathogenesis of AD is far to be clear. In this study we demonstrated that Uch-L1 inhibition induces BACE1 up-regulation and increases neuronal and apoptotic cell death in control as well as in transgenic AD mouse model subjected to Bengal Rose, a light-sensitive dye inducing that induces a cortical infarction through photo-activation. Under the same conditions we also found a significant activation of NF-κB. Thus, the restoration of Uch-L1 was able to completely prevent both the increase in BACE1 protein levels and the amount of cell death. Our data suggest that the Uch-L1-mediated BACE1 up-regulation could be an important mechanism responsible for Aβ peptides accumulation in vascular injury and indicate that the modulation of the activity of this enzyme could provide new therapeutic strategies in AD.","1663-4365","Frontiers in aging neuroscience","(9) 320",2017,"Michela","Guglielmotto","M","Department of Neuroscience, University of Torino, Torino, Italy."

Flavonoids have been reported to exert neuroprotective activities, not only through their generally accepted antioxidant effects, but also through their ability to protect against neurotoxin-induced injury. Flavonoids reduce Aβ production, inhibit neuroinflammation, increase cerebrovascular function, and improve cognitive performance. Here, we analyzed the effects of a flavonoid-rich ethanol extract from the leaves of Diospyros kaki (FLDK) in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. We found that oral treatment with FLDK reversed learning and memory impairment, reduced Aβ burden and expression of β-site amyloid precursor protein cleavage enzyme 1 (BACE1), and decreased microglial activation in senile plaques. FLDK restored antioxidant enzyme activities, as well as reduced the lipid peroxidation product, malondialdehyde, and inflammatory mediators. These results demonstrate that FLDK alleviates cognitive decline and reduces Aβ burden, microglial activation, oxidative stress, and inflammation responses. Thus, FLDK treatment may be a potential therapeutic strategy for preventing and treating AD, at least in part via its anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory biological activities and its effect on the Aβ producing enzyme BACE1.","1872-6240","Brain research","(1678) 85-93",2018,"Yingjuan","Ma","Y","Department of Senile Neurology, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan 250021, Shandong, PR China; Anti-Aging Monitoring Laboratory, Shandong Provincial Hospital Affiliated to Shandong University, Jinan 250021, Shandong, PR China."

Recent studies using Tg-5XFAD mice as a model of AD have reported that exposure to radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (RF-EMF) from cellular phones reduced Aβ plaques in the brain and showed beneficial effects on AD. In this study, we examined whether exposure to 1950 MHz RF-EMF affects Aβ processing in neural cells. We exposed HT22 mouse hippocampal neuronal cells and SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cells to RF-EMF (SAR 6 W/kg) for 2 h per day for 3 days, and analyzed the mRNA and protein expression of the key genes related to Aβ processing. When exposed to RF-EMF, mRNA levels of APP, BACE1, ADAM10 and PSEN1 were decreased in HT22, but the mRNA level of APP was not changed in SH-SY5Y cells. The protein expression of APP and BACE1, as well as the secreted Aβ peptide, was not significantly different between RF-EMF-exposed 7w-PSML, HT22 and SH-SY5Y cells and the unexposed controls. These observations suggest that RF-EMF exposure may not have a significant physiological effect on Aβ processing of neural cells in the short term. However, considering that we only exposed HT22 and SH-SY5Y cells to RF-EMF for 2 h per day for 3 days, we cannot exclude the possibility that 1950 MHz RF-EMF induces physiological change in Aβ processing with long-term and continuous exposure.","1349-9157","Journal of radiation research","(59) 18-26",2018,"Jeongyeon","Park","J","Department of Biochemistry, College of Life Science and Biotechnology, Yonsei University, Seoul 03722, Republic of Korea."

The enzymatic activity of this protein is given by the aspartic dyad, Asp93 and Asp289, which can adopt several protonation states depending on the chemical nature of its inhibitors, this is, monoprotonated, diprotonated and di-deprotonated states. In the present study, the analysis of the population density, for a series of protein-inhibitor molecular dynamics simulations, was carried out to identify the most feasible protonation state adopted by the catalytic dyad in the presence of tertiary carbinamine (TC) transition state analog inhibitors. The results revealed that the monoprotonated Asp289i state, in which the Asp93 and Asp289 residue side chains are deprotonated and protonated on the inner oxygen, respectively, is the most preferred in the presence of TC family inhibitors. This result was obtained after evaluating, for all 9 possible protonation state configurations, the individual and combined population densities of a set of parameters sensitive to protonation state of the Aspartic dyad, using an X-ray experimental BACE1/TC crystallographic structure as reference. This case study demonstrates again the usefulness of the concept of population density as a quantitative tool to establish the most stable system settings, among all possible, by measuring the level of occurrence of simultaneous events obtained from a sampling over time.

29078331,"Lack of BACE1 S-palmitoylation reduces amyloid burden and mitigates memory deficits in transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer's disease.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder characterized by pathological brain lesions and a decline in cognitive function. β-Amyloid peptides (Aβ), derived from proteolytic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP), play a central role in AD pathogenesis. β-Site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), the transmembrane aspartyl protease which initiates Aβ production, is axonally transported in neurons and accumulates in dystrophic neurites near cerebral amyloid deposits in AD. BACE1 is modified by S-palmitoylation at four juxtamembrane cysteine residues. S-palmitoylation is a dynamic posttranslational modification that is important for trafficking and function of several synaptic proteins. Here, we investigated the in vivo significance of BACE1 S-palmitoylation through the analysis of knock-in mice with cysteine-to-alanine substitution at the palmitoylated residues (4CA mice). BACE1 expression, as well as processing of APP and other neuronal substrates, was unaltered in 4CA mice despite the lack of BACE1 S-palmitoylation and reduced lipid raft association. Whereas steady-state Aβ levels were similar, synaptic activity-induced endogenous Aβ production was not observed in 4CA mice. Furthermore, we report a significant reduction of cerebral amyloid burden and BACE1 accumulation in dystrophic neurites in the absence of BACE1 S-palmitoylation in mouse models of AD amyloidosis. Studies in cultured neurons suggest that S-palmitoylation is required for dendritic spine localization and axonal targeting of BACE1. Finally, the lack of BACE1 S-palmitoylation mitigates cognitive deficits in 5XFAD mice. Using transgenic mouse models, these results demonstrate that intrinsic posttranslational S-palmitoylation of BACE1 has a significant impact on amyloid pathogenesis and the consequent cognitive decline.","1091-6490","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","(114) E9665-E9674",2017,"Robert J","Andrew","RJ","Department of Neurobiology, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637."

Here, we describe an in vitro model system that enables the facile analysis of neuronal disease mechanisms in non-neuronal patient cells using CRISPR gene activation of endogenous disease-relevant genes. In FAD patient-derived fibroblast cultures, CRISPR activation of APP or BACE unmasked an occult processivity defect in downstream GS-mediated carboxypeptidase cleavage of APP, ultimately leading to higher Aβ42 levels. These data suggest that, selectively in neurons, relatively high levels of BACE1 activity lead to substrate pressure on FAD-mutant GS complexes, promoting CNS Aβ42 accumulation.

However, the mechanisms that regulate endosome sorting of BACE1 are poorly understood. Here we assessed the transport of BACE1 from early to recycling endosomes and have identified essential roles for the sorting nexin 4 (SNX4)-mediated, signal-independent pathway and for a novel signal-mediated pathway. The signal-mediated pathway is regulated by the phosphorylation of the DXXLL-motif sequence DISLL in the cytoplasmic tail of BACE1. The phosphomimetic S498D BACE1 mutant was trafficked to recycling endosomes at a faster rate compared with wild-type BACE1 or the nonphosphorylatable S498A mutant. The rapid transit of BACE1 S498D from early endosomes was coupled with reduced levels of amyloid precursor protein processing and Aβ production, compared with the S498A mutant. We show that the adaptor, GGA1, and retromer are essential to mediate rapid trafficking of phosphorylated BACE1 to recycling endosomes. In addition, the BACE1 DISLL motif is phosphorylated and regulates endosomal trafficking, in primary neurons. Therefore, post-translational phosphorylation of DISLL enhances the exit of BACE1 from early endosomes, a pathway mediated by GGA1 and retromer, which is important in regulating Aβ production.","1939-4586","Molecular biology of the cell","(29) 191-208",2018,"Wei Hong","Toh","WH","Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology and Bio21 Molecular Science and Biotechnology Institute, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria 3010, Australia."

Although this effect has been attributed to an optimization of biotin's essential cofactor role in the brain, a case can be made that direct stimulation of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) by pharmacological concentrations of biotin plays a key role in this regard. The utility of high-dose biotin in MS might reflect an anti-inflammatory effect of cGMP on the cerebral microvasculature, as well on oligodendrocyte differentiation and on Schwann cell production of neurotrophic factors thought to have potential for managing MS. But biotin's ability to boost cGMP synthesis in the brain may have broader neuroprotective potential. In many types of neurons and neural cells, cGMP exerts neurotrophic-mimetic effects - entailing activation of the PI3K-Akt and Ras-ERK pathways - that promote neuron survival and plasticity. Hippocampal long term potentiation requires nitric oxide synthesis, which in turn promotes an activating phosphorylation of CREB via a pathway involving cGMP and protein kinase G (PKG). In Alzheimer's disease (AD), amyloid beta suppresses this mechanism by inhibiting sGC activity; agents which exert a countervailing effect by boosting cGMP levels tend to restore effective long-term potentiation in rodent models of AD. Moreover, NO/cGMP suppresses amyloid beta production within the brain by inhibiting expression of amyloid precursor protein and BACE1. In conjunction with cGMP's ability to oppose neuron apoptosis, these effects suggest that high-dose biotin might have potential for the prevention and management of AD. cGMP also promotes neurogenesis, and may lessen stroke risk by impeding atherogenesis and hypertrophic remodeling in the cerebral vasculature. The neuroprotective potential of high-dose biotin likely could be boosted by concurrent administration of brain-permeable phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors.","1532-2777","Medical hypotheses","(109) 145-149",2017,"Mark F","McCarty","MF","Catalytic Longevity, 811 B Nahant Ct., San Diego, CA 92109, USA.

Thus, we compared the accumulation of N-terminally truncated amyloid-β and full-length amyloid-β, depending on disease stage as well as brain area, and determined how these amyloid-β species respectively correlate with clinicopathological features of Alzheimer's disease. To this end, the amounts of amyloid-β species and other proteins related to amyloid-β metabolism or Alzheimer's disease were quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) or theoretically calculated in 12 brain regions, including neocortical, limbic and subcortical areas from Alzheimer's disease cases (n = 19), neurologically normal elderly without amyloid-β accumulation (normal ageing, n = 13), and neurologically normal elderly with cortical amyloid-β accumulation (pathological ageing, n = 15). We observed that N-terminally truncated amyloid-β42 and full-length amyloid-β42 accumulations distributed differently across disease stages and brain areas, while N-terminally truncated amyloid-β40 and full-length amyloid-β40 accumulation showed an almost identical distribution pattern. Cortical N-terminally truncated amyloid-β42 accumulation was increased in Alzheimer's disease compared to pathological ageing, whereas cortical full-length amyloid-β42 accumulation was comparable between Alzheimer's disease and pathological ageing. Moreover, N-terminally truncated amyloid-β42 were more likely to accumulate more in specific brain areas, especially some limbic areas, while full-length amyloid-β42 tended to accumulate more in several neocortical areas, including frontal cortices. Immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry analysis showed that several N-terminally truncated amyloid-β42 species, represented by pyroglutamylated amyloid-β11-42, were enriched in these areas, consistent with ELISA results. N-terminally truncated amyloid-β42 accumulation showed significant regional association with BACE1 and neprilysin, but not PSD95 that regionally associated with full-length amyloid-β42 accumulation. Interestingly, accumulations of tau and to a greater extent apolipoprotein E (apoE, encoded by APOE) were more strongly correlated with N-terminally truncated amyloid-β42 accumulation than those of other amyloid-β species across brain areas and disease stages. Consistently, immunohistochemical staining and in vitro binding assays showed that apoE co-localized and bound more strongly with pyroglutamylated amyloid-β11-x fibrils than full-length amyloid-β fibrils. Retrospective review of clinical records showed that accumulation of N-terminally truncated amyloid-β42 in cortical areas was associated with disease onset, duration and cognitive scores. Collectively, N-terminally truncated amyloid-β42 species have spatiotemporal accumulation patterns distinct from full-length amyloid-β42, likely due to different mechanisms governing their accumulations in the brain. These truncated amyloid-β species could play critical roles in the disease by linking other clinicopathological features of Alzheimer's disease.","1460-2156","Brain : a journal of neurology","(140) 3301-3316",2017,"Mitsuru","Shinohara","M","Department of Neuroscience, Mayo Clinic, Jacksonville, FL, USA."

29171411,"Beta secretase activity in peripheral nerve regeneration.","While the peripheral nervous system has the capacity to regenerate following a nerve injury, it is often at a slow rate and results in unsatisfactory recovery, leaving patients with reduced function. Many regeneration associated genes have been identified over the years, which may shed some insight into how we can manipulate this intrinsic regenerative ability to enhance repair following peripheral nerve injuries. Our lab has identified the membrane bound protease beta-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), or beta secretase, as a potential negative regulator of peripheral nerve regeneration. When beta secretase activity levels are abolished via a null mutation in mice, peripheral regeneration is enhanced following a sciatic nerve crush injury. Conversely, when activity levels are greatly increased by overexpressing beta secretase in mice, nerve regeneration and functional recovery are impaired after a sciatic nerve crush injury. In addition to our work, many substrates of beta secretase have been found to be involved in regulating neurite outgrowth and some have even been identified as regeneration associated genes. In this review, we set out to discuss BACE1 and its substrates with respect to axonal regeneration and speculate on the possibility of utilizing BACE1 inhibitors to enhance regeneration following acute nerve injury and potential uses in peripheral neuropathies.","1673-5374","Neural regeneration research","(12) 1565-1574",2017,"Carolyn","Tallon","C","Department of Neurology at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, USA."

The β-site amyloid protein precursor cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is the rate limiting enzyme in the generation of Aβ from APP, inhibition of BACE1 is thereby considered as an attractive strategy for anti-AD drug discovery. Chitosan oligosaccharides (COS) has been shown to possess various biological activities. Here we investigated the potential inhibitory effect of COS on both BACE1 expression in HEK293 APPswe cells and BACE1 enzymatic activity in vitro. The results showed that COS (100-500μg/ml) dose-dependently decreased the cell apoptosis, and potently repressed the secretion of both Aβ40 and Aβ42 as determined by ELISA. Moreover, treatment with COS resulted in a dramatic reduction in BACE1 mRNA and protein expression level, eIF2α phosphorylation as well as BACE1 enzymatic activity. Taken together, our findings indicate that COS can ameliorate Aβ-associated neurotoxicity, which may be, at least in part, attributable to reductions in BACE1 enzymatic activity and expression.","1872-7972","Neuroscience letters","(665) 80-85",2018,"Xueling","Dai","X","Beijing Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Functional Foods, Beijing Union University, Beijing 100191, China.

Furthermore, neuronal inflammation is one cause of postoperative cognitive disorder (POCD) and delirium. However, no sufficiently established pharmacological treatment is available for neurocognitive inflammation. This study evaluated the possible neuroprotective effects of preconditioning with sevoflurane anesthesia on cognition and neuroinflammatory changes in an animal model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced systemic inflammation. Adult mice were randomly divided into (1) control, (2) 2% sevoflurane preconditioning for 1 h, (3) intraperitoneal 5 mg/kg LPS injection, and (4) 2% sevoflurane preconditioning for 1 h + LPS injection groups. At 24 h after 5 mg/kg LPS injection, microglial activation based on ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba-1) expression in the hippocampus was determined using immunostaining and immunoblotting. IL-1β and IL-6 immunoblotting were used as inflammation markers, and β-site of amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) immunoblotting was performed to evaluate amyloid β-protein (Aβ) accumulation. Long-term cognitive impairment was evaluated using fear conditioning tests. Intraperitoneal LPS increased levels of Iba-1 (150%), inflammation markers (160%), and Aβ accumulation (350%), and sevoflurane preconditioning suppressed these increases. Systemic LPS caused learning deficits. Sevoflurane also maintained long-term memory in mice receiving LPS injection. Sevoflurane preconditioning prevented long-term memory impairment in the mouse model administered systemic LPS by decreasing excessive microglial activation, inflammation, and Aβ accumulation. This study supports the hypothesis that sevoflurane preconditioning might also be beneficial for neuronal inflammation. Sevoflurane might be beneficial for reducing delirium and POCD.","1881-7122","Experimental animals","(67) 193-200",2018,"Maiko","Satomoto","M","Department of Anesthesiology, Graduate School of Medical and Dental Sciences, Tokyo Medical and Dental University, 1-5-45 Yushima, Bunkyo-ku, Tokyo 113-8519, Japan."

The main clinical manifestations of AD include progressive cognitive impairment and alteration of personality. Senile plaques, neuroinflammation, and destruction of synapse structure stability are the main pathological features of AD. Bajijiasu(BJJS) is extracted from Morinda Officinalis, a Chinese herb. In this study, we explored the effect of BJJS on AD from many aspects in APPswe/PSEN1ΔE9 (APP/PS1) double transgenic mice. The Morris water maze and novel object recognition tests results showed that BJJS could significantly improve the learning and memory abilities in APP/PS1 mice. BJJS treatment increased the level of insulin degradation enzyme (IDE) and neprilysin (NEP) and decreased the level of β-site app cleaving enzyme 1(BACE1) in the brain of APP/PS1 mice. BJJS-treated APP/PS1 mice appeared to have reductions of Aβ deposition and senile plaques, and showed higher levels of neurotrophic factors in the brain. We also found that BJJS had an inhibitory function on neuroinflammation in APP/PS1 mice. In addition, the synapse structure relevant proteins were elevated in the brain of BJJS-treated APP/PS1 mice. The present results indicated that BJJS could attenuate cognitive impairment via ameliorating the AD-related pathological alterations in APP/PS1 mice.

Aggressive Aβ accumulation promotes senile plaque formation and perturbs endoplasmic reticulum (ER) function to trigger the unfolded protein response (UPR) leading to neuronal apoptosis. The stress-dependent activation of protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) increases the phosphorylation of eukaryotic translation initiation factor-2α (eIF2α) to promote the preferential synthesis of β-site APP cleavage enzyme 1 (BACE1) and Aβ generation in turn. Additionally, dysfunction in autophagy has been reported to contribute to several neurodegenerative diseases including AD, and impairment in autophagy-mediated pathway may constitutively stimulate the generation of Aβ in AD.

Flavonoids have recently been used to prevent and treat a variety of neurodegenerative diseases, but little is known about bioflavonoids. In this study, we evaluate whether a biflavonoid fraction (BF) exerts neuroprotective effects on an aged triple transgenic mouse mode of AD (3xTg-AD). Then, 21-24-month-old 3xTg AD mice were i.p. injected with 25mg/kg of a BF from Garcinia madruno composed of morelloflavone (65%), volkensiflavone (12%), GB 2a (11%), fukugiside (6%) and amentoflavone (0.4%) every 48h for 3 months. The BF treatment reduced βA deposition in different regions of the brain (the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex and amygdala), reduced βA1-40 and βA1-42 levels, BACE1-mediated cleavage of APP (CTFβ), tau pathology, astrogliosis and microgliosis in the brains of aged 3xTg-AD mice. Although the BF treatment weakly improved learning, animals treated with BF spent more time in the open arms of the elevated plus maze test and displayed greater risk assessment behavior than the control groups. In summary, the BF reverses histopathological hallmarks and reduces emotional disorders in the 3xTg-AD mouse model, suggesting that the biflavonoids from G. madruno represent a potential natural therapeutic option for AD if its bioavailability is improved.","1096-1186","Pharmacological research","(129) 128-138",2018,"Angélica Maria","Sabogal-Guáqueta","AM","Neuroscience Group of Antioquia, Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology Area - School of Medicine, SIU, University of Antioquia, Calle 70 # 52-21, Medellin, Colombia."

Detergent-solubilized and purified membrane proteins are therefore often reconstituted into cell-membrane mimics and analyzed for their function with single-molecule microscopy. Expansion of this approach toward a broad range of pharmaceutically interesting drug targets and biomarkers however remains hampered by the fact that these proteins have low expression levels, and that detergent solubilization and reconstitution often cause protein conformational changes and loss of membrane-specific cofactors, which may impair protein function. To overcome this limitation, we here demonstrate how antibody-modified nanoparticles can be used to achieve affinity purification and enrichment of selected integral membrane proteins directly from cell membrane preparations. Nanoparticles were first bound to the ectodomain of β-secretase 1 (BACE1) contained in cell-derived membrane vesicles. In a subsequent step, these were merged into a continuous supported membrane in a microfluidic channel. Through the extended nanoparticle tag, a weak (∼fN) hydrodynamic force could be applied, inducing directed in-membrane movement of targeted BACE1 exclusively. This enabled selective thousand-fold enrichment of the targeted membrane protein while preserving a natural lipid environment. In addition, nanoparticle-targeting also enabled simultaneous tracking analysis of each individual manipulated protein, revealing how their mobility changed when moved from one lipid environment to another. We therefore believe this approach will be particularly useful for separation in-line with single-molecule analysis, eventually opening up for membrane-protein sorting devices analogous to fluorescence-activated cell sorting.","1530-6992","Nano letters","(18) 381-385",2018,"Anders","Lundgren","A","Department of Physics, Chalmers University of Technology , 41296 Göteborg, Sweden."

It is thought that Aβ plaques trigger NFT formation, neuronal cell death, neuroinflammation and gliosis and, ultimately, cognitive impairment. There are increased numbers of reactive astrocytes in AD, which surround amyloid plaques and secrete proinflammatory factors and can phagocytize and break down Aβ. It was thought that neuronal cells were the major source of Aβ. However, mounting evidence suggests that astrocytes may play an additional role in AD by secreting significant quantities of Aβ and contributing to overall amyloid burden in the brain. Astrocytes are the most numerous cell type in the brain, and therefore even minor quantities of amyloid secretion from individual astrocytes could prove to be substantial when taken across the whole brain. Reactive astrocytes have increased levels of the three necessary components for Aβ production: amyloid precursor protein, β-secretase (BACE1) and γ-secretase. The identification of environmental factors, such as neuroinflammation, that promote astrocytic Aβ production, could redefine how we think about developing therapeutics for AD.","2046-2441","Open biology","170228",2017,"Georgia R","Frost","GR","Chemical Biology Program, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY 10065, USA frostg@mskcc.org."

We found that Navβ2 knockdown in APP/PS1 mice partially reversed the abnormal Navβ2 cleavage and the changes in intracellular and total Nav1.1α expression. It also restored sodium currents density in hippocampal neurons and neuronal activity, as indicated by EEG tracing; improved Morris water maze performance; and shifted APP amyloidogenic metabolism towards non-amyloidogenic processing. There were no differences in these indicators between WT and Navβ2-kd mice.

Beginning at 7.5 (mild pathology) or 13 (severe pathology) months of age, 3xTg-AD mice were treated intraperitoneally with 4 mg/kg TBO or vehicle daily for 30 days.

When the levels of full-length amyloid precursor protein (APP) and β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) were assessed in 3xTg-AD mice at late pathological stage, no significant changes were observed after TBO treatment. Similarly, TBO did not recover hyperphosphorylation of tau at residues Thr181 and Ser202/Thr205 significantly in soluble and insoluble hippocampal fractions of 3xTg-AD mice. Taken together, the current study is the first in vivo report, to our knowledge, demonstrating that TBO mitigates amyloid pathology in 3xTg-AD mice with no apparent change on tau phosphorylation.

Subsequent cleavage by γ-secretase produces amyloid-β (Aβ) and an AβPP intracellular domain (AICD). A cellular screen based on the generation of AICD from an AβPP-Gal4 fusion protein was adapted by introducing familial AD (FAD) mutations into the AβPP sequence and linking the assay to Gal4-UAS driven luciferase and GFP expression, to identify responses immediately downstream of AβPP processing in neurons with a focus on the transcription factor Foxo3a which has been implicated in neurodegeneration. The K670N/M671L, E682K, E693G, and V717I FAD mutations and the A673T protective mutation, were introduced into the AβPP sequence by site directed mutagenesis. When expressed in mouse cortical neurons, AβPP-Gal4-UAS driven luciferase and GFP expression was substantially reduced by γ-secretase inhibitors, lowered by β-secretase inhibitors, and enhanced by α-secretase inhibitors suggesting that AICD is a product of the βγ-secretase pathway. AβPP-Gal4-UAS driven GFP expression was exploited to identify individual neurons undergoing amyloidogenic AβPP processing, revealing increased nuclear localization of Foxo3a and enhanced Foxo3a-mediated transcription downstream of AICD production. Foxo3a translocation was not driven by AICD directly but correlated with reduced Akt phosphorylation. Collectively this suggests that βγ-secretase-mediated AβPP processing couples to Foxo3a which could be an early neuronal signaling response in AD.","1875-8908","Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD","(61) 673-688",2018,"Bernard M","Law","BM","Department of Biology and Biochemistry, University of Bath, Bath, UK."

D₂ and D₃ analogues decreased Aβ-production and increased Aβ-degradation in neuroblastoma cells or vitamin D deficient mouse brains. Effects were mediated by affecting the Aβ-producing enzymes BACE1 and γ-secretase. A reduced secretase activity was accompanied by a decreased BACE1 protein level and nicastrin expression, an essential component of the γ-secretase. Vitamin D and analogues decreased β-secretase activity, not only in mouse brains with mild vitamin D hypovitaminosis, but also in non-deficient mouse brains.

We have shown ORP150 as a chaperone interacts with and stabilizes BACE1 at post-translational level. Furthermore, ORP150 enhances BACE1-mediated amyloid processing thus masking CHIP-mediated BACE1 degradation. Conversely, siORP150 reversed the chaperone function of ORP150 resulting in BACE1 degradation. ORP150 and CHIP demonstrate antagonism under normal and stress conditions wherein they inversely regulate each other thus affecting BACE1 level.

After treatment for 24 h, protein expression of Aβ and β-site Aβ precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and activated PPARγ level were determined by Western blot; Aβ42 levels were also measured by using both immunofluorescence and ELISA methods. BACE1 activity and mRNA level were assessed by fluorospectrophotometry and quantitative PCR, respectively. Cell viability was assayed with a CCK-8 kit. Elevated Aβ expression and Aβ42 level were found in HG-treated HT-22 cells, accompanied by increased BACE1 protein and mRNA levels as well as enzymatic activity, which was markedly attenuated by three concentrations of Sar and pioglitazone. Moreover, HG reduced nuclear PPARγ levels, which was reversed by middle and high concentrations of Sar as well as pioglitazone.

In the present study, Chinese hamster ovary cells stably transfected with amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin 1 (PS1) (CHO-APP/PS1 cells) and SAMP8 mice fed with an HF diet were used to study the effects of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)-enriched phosphatidylcholine (DHA-PC) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)-enriched phosphatidylcholine (EPA-PC) on Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the possible mechanisms involved in these effects. Behavior test results indicated that DHA-PC exerted better effects than EPA-PC on improving memory and cognitive deficiency. Further analysis showed that DHA-PC and EPA-PC could significantly decrease β-amyloid (Aβ) concentrations in CHO-APP/PS1 cells and SAMP8 mice by inhibiting APP, PS1, and BACE1 expression. Moreover, both DHA-PC and EPA-PC can increase the activities of the antioxidant index, including SOD, T-AOC, GSH, and GSH-PX, and inhibit levels of MDA, NO, and NOS. In addition, the expressions of inflammatory factors (TNF-α, IL-1β) and apoptosis were significantly suppressed via improving the ratio of Bcl-2/Bax and decreasing the expression of pro-apoptosis factors. Interestingly, only DHA-PC could improve the expression of neurotrophic factors, including BDNF, synaptophysin, and growth associated protein 43. DHA-PC and EPA-PC could ameliorate memory and cognitive function of HF diet-fed SAMP8 mice via inhibiting Aβ generation, suppressing oxidative stress and apoptosis, down-regulating inflammatory response, and improving neurotrophic activity. Therefore, DHA-PC and EPA-PC may be applied as food supplements and/or functional ingredients to relieve neurodegenerative disease.","2042-650X","Food & function","(9) 643-654",2018,"Hongxia","Che","H","College of Food Science and Engineering, Ocean University of China, Qingdao, 266003, Shandong, China. wangyuming@ouc.edu.cn xuech@ouc.edu.cn."

Recently, both these targets received attention for designing dual inhibitors. Till now only two scaffolds (triazinone and curcumin) derivatives have been reported as BACE-1 and GSK-3β dual inhibitors. In our previous work, we have reported first in class dual inhibitor for BACE-1 and GSK-3β. In this study, we have explored other naphthofuran derivatives for their potential to inhibit BACE-1 and GSK-3β through docking, molecular dynamics, binding energy (MM-PBSA). These computational methods were performed to estimate the binding affinity of naphthofuran derivatives towards the BACE-1 and GSK-3β. In the docking results, two derivatives (NS7 and NS9) showed better binding affinity as compared to previously reported inhibitors. Hydrogen bond occupancy of NS7 and NS9 generated from MD trajectories showed good interaction with the flap residues Gln73, Thr72 of BACE-1 and Arg141, Thr138 residues of GSK-3β. MM-PBSA and energy decomposition per residue revealed different components of binding energy and relative importance of amino acid involved in binding. The results showed that the binding of inhibitors was majorly governed by the hydrophobic interactions and suggesting that hydrophobic interactions might be the key to design dual inhibitors for BACE1-1 and GSK-3β. Distance between important pair of amino acid residues indicated that BACE-1 and GSK-3β adopt closed conformation and become inactive after ligand binding.

However, so far pharmacological BACE1 inhibition failed to rescue the cognitive decline in mild-to-moderate AD patients, which indicates that treatment at the symptomatic stage might be too late. In the current study, chronic in vivo two-photon microscopy was performed in a transgenic AD model to monitor the impact of pharmacological BACE1 inhibition on early β-amyloid pathology. The longitudinal approach allowed to assess the kinetics of individual plaques and associated presynaptic pathology, before and throughout treatment. BACE1 inhibition could not halt but slow down progressive β-amyloid deposition and associated synaptic pathology. Notably, the data revealed that the initial process of plaque formation, rather than the subsequent phase of gradual plaque growth, is most sensitive to BACE1 inhibition.

Histopathological hallmarks of AD include neurofibrillary tangles centered on hyperphosphorylated Tau and plaques composed of the β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide that is derived by sequential secretase-mediated cleavage of the Amyloid Protein Precursor (APP). We chose to examine profiles of Aβ(1-40), Aβ(1-42), and N-truncated (i.e., p3-related) fragments in the plaque-associated fraction of autopsied cortical and corresponding hippocampal samples from donors with a diagnosis of early-onset (EOAD) and late-onset (LOAD) AD. Levels of Aβ(1-40), Aβ(1-42), and the p3 fragment-enriched pool were increased in EOAD and LOAD samples, and correlated well within -but not between- regions. Counterintuitively, these increases were similar regardless of the AD donor's APOE ε4 status. Focusing on the donor's sex and APOE ε4 status as nominal variables (i.e., omitting diagnosis from the stratification) revealed that increases in Aβ peptides were specific to female carriers of the ε4 allele and correlated with the proportional expression of BACE1/β-secretase and ADAM10/α-secretase in the cortex and with nicastrin (γ-secretase) expression in the hippocampus. These data preliminarily support the possibility that AD follows distinct amyloidogenic processes in males and females, and that the APOE ε4 allele exerts a major influence on the disease process, particularly in women. This knowledge could significantly impact the (re)interpretation of unsuccessful outcomes of clinical interventions targeting either Aβ peptides directly or the secretases implicated in APP processing.","1873-7544","Neuroscience","(373) 20-36",2018,"Jennifer N K","Nyarko","JNK","Cell Signalling Laboratory, Department of Psychiatry, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada."

Multi-Target- Directed Ligands (MTDLs) have emerged as an original strategy for developing new therapeutic agents on AD. Multicomponent Reactions (MCRs) are a useful alternative to sequential multistep syntheses, allowing scaffold diversity and a rapid and easy access to biologically relevant compounds. The biological diversity of MCRs is very rich providing great possibilities for researchers interested in bioactive small molecular weight compounds. Since the MTDL strategy has been used to develop compounds endowed with the capacity to interact with different targets, versatile compound libraries may be obtained by MCRs according to the well established features of each target. Thus, either MTDLs or monotarget compounds have been developed by MCRs to address different factors implicated in AD. This work focuses on antioxidants, calcium channel modulators, both AChE and BuChE inhibitors, BACE1 inhibitors, and modulators of the nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2.

Senescence caused a decrease in APP expression thereby resulting in reduced secretion of soluble APPα (sAPPα). In contrast, β-site APP cleaving enzyme (BACE1) expression and production of amyloid β (Aβ)40 were increased in senescent endothelium. Importantly, in senescent human BMECs, treatment with BACE1 inhibitor IV inhibited Aβ generation and increased sAPPα production by enhancing a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM)10 expression. Furthermore, Ang II impaired expression of ADAM10 and significantly reduced generation of sAPPα in senescent human BMECs. This inhibitory effect of Ang II was prevented by treatment with BACE1 inhibitor IV. Our results suggest that impairment of α-processing and shift to amyloidogenic pathway of APP contribute to endothelial dysfunction induced by senescence. Loss of sAPPα in senescent cells treated with Ang II exacerbates detrimental effects of senescence on APP processing. Notably, inhibition of BACE1 has beneficial effects on senescence induced endothelial dysfunction. Reported findings may help to explain contributions of senescent cerebral microvascular endothelium to development of cerebral amyloid angiopathy and Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology.","1945-4589","Aging","(10) 100-114",2018,"Ruohan","Sun","R","Department of Neurology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Harbin Medical University, Harbin, Heilongjiang Province, 150001, China."

The docking study revealed that genistein had negative binding energy (-8.5 kcal/mol) and was stably positioned in the allosteric domains of BACE1 residues. It interacted with important amino acid residues in BACE1, such as ASN37, GLN73, and TRP76, through hydrogen bonding.

In current study, 3-month-old male C57BL/6J mice were treated with 0.03% LYC (w/w, mixed into normal chow) for 5 weeks. The mice were then treated by intraperitoneal injection of LPS (0.25mg/kg) for 9 days. It was found that LYC inhibited LPS-induced memory loss by behavior tests including Y-maze test and Morris water test. Meanwhile, LYC prevented LPS-induced accumulation of Aβ, levels of amyloid precursor protein (APP), and suppressed neuronal β-secretase BACE1 and elevated the expressions of α-secretase ADAM10. Furthermore, LYC down-regulated the expression of IBA-1 (a marker of microglia activation), reduced the levels of inflammatory mediators and inhibited oxidative stress in LPS-treated mice. Moreover, LYC suppressed the phosphorylation of MAPKs, NFκB, and activated Nrf2 signaling pathways in LPS-treated BV2 microglial cells. Therefore, our study indicated that LYC could ameliorate LPS-induced neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, amyloidogenesis and cognitive impairments possibly through mediating MAPKs, NFκB and Nrf2 signaling pathways, indicating that LYC might be a nutritional preventive strategy in neuroinflammation-related diseases such as AD.","1873-4847","The Journal of nutritional biochemistry","(56) 16-25",2018,"Jia","Wang","J","Laboratory of Functional Chemistry and Nutrition of Food, College of Food Science and Engineering, Northwest A&F University, Yangling, China."
29466703,"sAPPβ and sAPPα increase structural complexity and E/I input ratio in primary hippocampal neurons and alter Ca","One major pathophysiological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is senile plaques composed of amyloid β (Aβ). In the amyloidogenic pathway, cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is shifted towards Aβ production and soluble APPβ (sAPPβ) levels. Aβ is known to impair synaptic function; however, much less is known about the physiological functions of sAPPβ. The neurotrophic properties of sAPPα, derived from the non-amyloidogenic pathway of APP cleavage, are well-established, whereas only a few, conflicting studies on sAPPβ exist. The intracellular pathways of sAPPβ are largely unknown. Since sAPPβ is generated alongside Aβ by β-secretase (BACE1) cleavage, we tested the hypothesis that sAPPβ effects differ from sAPPα effects as a neurotrophic factor. We therefore performed a head-to-head comparison of both mammalian recombinant peptides in developing primary hippocampal neurons (PHN). We found that sAPPα significantly increases axon length (p = 0.0002) and that both sAPPα and sAPPβ increase neurite number (p < 0.0001) of PHN at 7 days in culture (DIV7) but not at DIV4. Moreover, both sAPPα- and sAPPβ-treated neurons showed a higher neuritic complexity in Sholl analysis. The number of glutamatergic synapses (p < 0.0001), as well as layer thickness of postsynaptic densities (PSDs), were significantly increased, and GABAergic synapses decreased upon sAPP overexpression in PHN. Furthermore, we showed that sAPPα enhances ERK and CREB1 phosphorylation upon glutamate stimulation at DIV7, but not DIV4 or DIV14. These neurotrophic effects are further associated with increased glutamate sensitivity and CREB1-signaling. Finally, we found that sAPPα levels are significantly reduced in brain homogenates of AD patients compared to control subjects. Taken together, our data indicate critical stage-dependent roles of sAPPs in the developing glutamatergic system in vitro, which might help to understand deleterious consequences of altered APP shedding in AD patients, beyond Aβ pathophysiology.","1090-2430","Experimental neurology","(304) 1-13",2018,"Raphael","Hesse","R","Department of Neurology, Ulm University, Ulm, Germany."

It has been reported that Schisandrin B could improve cognitive functions in animal models of AD, but the underlying mechanisms are not completely understood. MATERIAL AND METHODS In this research, in order to investigate the effects of Schisandrin B on amyloid-β (Aβ) metabolism and its mechanisms, amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its proteolytic products were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), western blotting, and RT-PCR after incubation of N2a/Swe cells with Schisandrin B. RESULTS The results indicated that Schisandrin B can significantly reduce the level of secretion of Aβ40 and Aβ42 secreted in N2a/Swe cells. Additionally, there was nonsignificant change in APP level after Schisandrin B treatment. Treatment of Schisandrin B dramatically reduced the mRNA and protein expression levels of BACE1. Moreover, Schisandrin B treatment resulted in a reduction of protein level of sAPPβ, an APP fragment cleavage by BACE1. CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that Schisandrin B inhibits the transcription and translation of BACE1, suppresses the activity of BACE1, and ultimately attenuates Aβ generation, which provides a novel mechanism for the regulation of Aβ metabolism by Schisandrin B.","1643-3750","Medical science monitor : international medical journal of experimental and clinical research","(24) 1219-1224",2018,"Zeng","Li","Z","School of Pharmacy, Anhui Key Laboratory of Bioactivity of Natural Products, Anhui Medical University, Hefei, Anhui, China (mainland)."

Since exposure to stress during early life enhances stress-responsiveness and lastingly affects cognition in adult life, we here investigated; (i) whether chronic early life stress (ELS) affects AD pathology and cognition in middle-aged APPswe/PS1dE9 mice, and (ii) whether it is still possible to rescue these late effects by briefly blocking glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) at a translationally relevant, middle age. Transgenic APPswe/PS1dE9 mice were subjected to ELS by housing dams and pups with limited nesting and bedding material from postnatal days 2-9 only. In 6- and 12-month-old offspring, this resulted in enhanced hippocampal amyloid-β (Aβ)-40 and -42 levels, and in reduced cognitive flexibility, that correlated well with the Aβ42 levels. In parallel, CORT levels and BACE1 levels were significantly elevated. Surprisingly, blocking GRs for only 3 days at 12 months of age reduced CORT levels, reduced hippocampal Aβ40 and -42, and β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) levels, and notably rescued the cognitive deficits in 12-month-old APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. These mouse data demonstrate that exposure to stress during the sensitive period early in life influences later amyloid pathology and cognition in genetically predisposed, mutant mice, and as such, may increase AD vulnerability. The fact that a short treatment with a GR antagonist at middle age lastingly reduced Aβ levels and rescued the cognitive deficits after ELS, highlights the therapeutic potential of this drug for reducing amyloid pathology.","2158-3188","Translational psychiatry","(8) 53",2018,"Sylvie L","Lesuis","SL","Swammerdam Institute for Life Sciences, Centre for Neuroscience, University of Amsterdam, Science Park 904, 1098 XH, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

One of the risk factors for AD is high cholesterol levels, which are known to promote Aβ deposition. Previous studies have shown that royal jelly (RJ), a product of worker bees, has potential neuroprotective effects and can attenuate Aβ toxicity. However, little is known about how RJ regulates Aβ formation and its effects on cholesterol levels and neuronal metabolic activities. Here, we investigated whether RJ can reduce cholesterol levels, regulate Aβ levels and enhance neuronal metabolic activities in an AD rabbit model induced by 2% cholesterol diet plus copper drinking water. Our results suggest that RJ significantly reduced the levels of plasma total cholesterol (TC) and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), and decreased the level of Aβ in rabbit brains. RJ was also shown to markedly ameliorate amyloid deposition in AD rabbits from Aβ immunohistochemistry and thioflavin-T staining. Furthermore, our study suggests that RJ can reduce the expression levels of β-site APP cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE1) and receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), and increase the expression levels of low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP-1) and insulin degrading enzyme (IDE). In addition, we found that RJ remarkably increased the number of neurons, enhanced antioxidant capacities, inhibited activated-capase-3 protein expression, and enhanced neuronal metabolic activities by increasing N-acetyl aspartate (NAA) and glutamate and by reducing choline and myo-inositol in AD rabbits. Taken together, our data demonstrated that RJ could reduce cholesterol levels, regulate Aβ levels and enhance neuronal metabolic activities in AD rabbits, providing preclinical evidence that RJ treatment has the potential to protect neurons and prevent AD.","1663-4365","Frontiers in aging neuroscience","(10) 50",2018,"Yongming","Pan","Y","College of Animal Sciences, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China."

However, how BACE1 activity is posttranslationally regulated remains incompletely understood. Here, we show that BACE1 is predominantly SUMOylated at K501 residue, which escalates its protease activity and stability and subsequently increases Aβ production, leading to cognitive defect seen in the AD mouse model. Compared with a non-SUMOylated K501R mutant, injection of wild-type BACE1 significantly increases Aβ production and triggers cognitive dysfunction. Furthermore, overexpression of wild-type BACE1, but not non-SUMOylated K501R mutant, facilitates senile plaque formation and aggravates the cognitive deficit seen in the APP/PS1 AD mouse model.

The clinical fate of active-site BACE inhibitors may depend on potential side effects related to enzyme and substrate selectivity. One strategy to reduce this risk is through development of allosteric inhibitors that interact with and modulate the Loop F region unique to BACE1. Previously, a BACE-inhibiting antibody (Ab) was shown by co-crystallization to bind and induce conformational changes of Loop F, resulting in backbone perturbations at the distal S6 and S7 subsites, preventing proper binding of a long APP-like substrate to BACE and inhibiting its cleavage. In an effort to discover small Loop F-interacting molecules that mimic the Ab inhibition, we evaluated a peptide series with a YPYF(I/L)P(L/Y) motif that was reported to bind a BACE exosite. Our studies show that the most potent inhibitor from this series, peptide 65007, has a similar substrate cleavage profile to the Ab and reduces sAPPβ levels in cell models and primary neurons. As our modeling indicates, it interacts with the Loop F region causing a conformational shift of the BACE protein backbone near the distal subsites. The peptide-bound enzyme adopts a conformation that closely overlays with the crystal structure (PDB: 3R1G) from Ab binding. Importantly, peptide 65007 appears to be BACE substrate and enzyme selective, showing little inhibition of NRG1, PSGL1, CHL1, or Cat D. Thus, peptide 65007 is a promising lead for discovery of Loop F-interacting small-molecule mimetics as allosteric inhibitors of BACE.","1089-8638","Journal of molecular biology","(430) 1566-1576",2018,"Jesus","Campagna","J","The Drug Discovery Lab, Mary S.

Homocysteine (Hcy) injection for 14 days was used to induce AD-like pathology. Simultaneous MO extract gavage followed the injection as a preventive treatment or, after injection completion, MO gavage was performed for another 14 days as a curative treatment. MO was found to not only prevent but also rescue the oxidative stress and cognitive impairments induced by Hcy treatment. Moreover, MO recovered the decreased synaptic proteins PSD93, PSD95, Synapsin 1 and Synaptophysin, and improved neurodegeneration. Interestingly, MO decreased the Hyc-induced tau hyperphosphorylation at different sites including S-199, T-231, S-396, and S-404, and at the same time decreased Aβ production through downregulation of BACE1. These effects in HHcy rats were accompanied by a decrease in calpain activity under MO treatment, supporting that calpain activation might be involved in AD pathogenesis in HHcy rats.

29716987,"Click Chemistry-mediated Biotinylation Reveals a Function for the Protease BACE1 in Modulating the Neuronal Surface Glycoproteome.","The cell surface proteome is dynamic and has fundamental roles in cell signaling. Many surface membrane proteins are proteolytically released into a cell's secretome, where they can have additional functions in cell-cell-communication. Yet, it remains challenging to determine the surface proteome and to compare it to the cell secretome, under serum-containing cell culture conditions. Here, we set up and evaluated the 'surface-spanning protein enrichment with click sugars' (SUSPECS) method for cell surface membrane glycoprotein biotinylation, enrichment and label-free quantitative mass spectrometry. SUSPECS is based on click chemistry-mediated labeling of glycoproteins, is compatible with labeling of living cells and can be combined with secretome analyses in the same experiment. Immunofluorescence-based confocal microscopy demonstrated that SUSPECS selectively labeled cell surface proteins. Nearly 700 transmembrane glycoproteins were consistently identified at the surface of primary neurons. To demonstrate the utility of SUSPECS, we applied it to the protease BACE1, which is a key drug target in Alzheimer's disease. Pharmacological BACE1-inhibition selectively remodeled the neuronal surface glycoproteome, resulting in up to 7-fold increased abundance of the BACE1 substrates APP, APLP1, SEZ6, SEZ6L, CNTN2, and CHL1, whereas other substrates were not or only mildly affected. Interestingly, protein changes at the cell surface only partly correlated with changes in the secretome. Several altered proteins were validated by immunoblots in neurons and mouse brains. Apparent nonsubstrates, such as TSPAN6, were also increased, indicating that BACE1-inhibition may lead to unexpected secondary effects. In summary, SUSPECS is broadly useful for determination of the surface glycoproteome and its correlation with the secretome.","1535-9484","Molecular & cellular proteomics : MCP","(17) 1487-1501",2018,"Julia","Herber","J","From the ‡German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Munich, Germany."

Aβ is generated from sequential cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and the γ-secretase complex. Although activation of some protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms such as PKCα and ε has been shown to regulate nonamyloidogenic pathways and Aβ degradation, it is unclear whether other PKC isoforms are involved in APP processing/AD pathogenesis. In this study, we report that increased PKCδ levels correlate with BACE1 expression in the AD brain. PKCδ knockdown reduces BACE1 expression, BACE1-mediated APP processing, and Aβ production. Conversely, overexpression of PKCδ increases BACE1 expression and Aβ generation. Importantly, inhibition of PKCδ by rottlerin markedly reduces BACE1 expression, Aβ levels, and neuritic plaque formation and rescues cognitive deficits in an APP Swedish mutations K594N/M595L/presenilin-1 with an exon 9 deletion-transgenic AD mouse model.

Changes in brain cholesterol homeostasis have been suggested to affect Aβ metabolism. Cholesterol homeostasis is maintained in the brain by apolipoprotein E (apoE). The apoE4 isoform constitutes the major risk factor for AD. Here, we investigated the effect of apoE forms on Aβ generation and on BACE1 levels. We also examined the potential involvement in these processes of cholesterol transporters ABCG1 and ABCG4 or the lipoprotein receptor SR-BI, which are implicated in cholesterol efflux to apoE. It was found that reconstituted lipoprotein-associated apoE isoforms promoted the increase of Aβ production and oligomerization and of BACE1 levels in human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells, with an apoE4 ≥ apoE3 > apoE2 potency rank order. Progressive carboxyl-terminal apoE4 deletions between residues 230-299 decreased the protein's ability to increase BACE1, while further truncations up to residue 166 prevented apoE4 from increasing BACE1 and Aβ levels in SK-N-SH and primary mouse neuronal cells. ABCG1, but not ABCG4 or SR-BI, moderately increased Aβ production and BACE1 levels in SK-N-SH cells. All apoE forms affected Aβ production/oligomerization and BACE1 levels in a pattern that did not follow that of their capacity to promote ABCG1, ABCG4 or SR-BI-mediated cholesterol efflux. Overall, our data indicate that apoE-containing lipoprotein particles can have a direct effect on BACE1 levels and Aβ secretion and possibly contribute to AD pathogenetic processes, independently of their capacity to promote cholesterol efflux.","1470-8728","The Biochemical journal","(475) 1839-1859",2018,"Ioannis","Dafnis","I","Institute of Biosciences and Applications, National Center for Scientific Research 'Demokritos', Agia Paraskevi, Athens 15341, Greece."

Current platelet protein biomarkers that have been investigated for their clinical utility in the diagnosis of dementia, in particular Alzheimer's disease, include amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP), the AβPP secretases (BACE1 and ADAM10), α-synuclein, tau protein, serotonin, cholesterol, phospholipases, clusterin, IgG, surface receptors, MAO-B, and coated platelets. Few of them, i.e., platelet tau, AβPP (particularly with regards to coated platelets) and secreted ADAM10 and BACE1 show the most promise to be taken forward into clinical setting to diagnose dementia. Aside from protein biomarkers, changes in factors such as mean platelet volume have the potential to play a very specific role in both the dementia diagnosis and prognosis. This review raises a number of research questions for consideration before application of the above biomarkers to routine clinical setting.

The clinical symptoms of AD include a progressive loss of memory and impairment of cognitive functions interfering with daily life activities. The main neuropathological features consist in extracellular amyloid-β (Aβ) plaque deposition and intracellular Neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) of hyperphosphorylated Tau. Understanding the pathophysiological mechanisms that underlie neurodegeneration in AD is essential for rational design of neuroprotective agents able to prevent disease progression. According to the ""Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis"" the critical molecular event in the pathogenesis of AD is the accumulation of Aβ neurotoxic oligomers. Since the proteolytic processing of Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP) by β-secretase (beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1, BACE1) is the rate-limiting step in the production of Aβ, this enzyme is considered a major therapeutic target and BACE1 inhibitors have the potential to be disease-modifying drugs for AD treatment. Therefore, intensive efforts to discover and develop inhibitors that can reach the brain and effectively inhibit BACE1 have been pursued by several groups worldwide. The aim of this review is to highlight the progress in the discovery of potent and selective small molecule BACE1 inhibitors over the past decade.","2296-2646","Frontiers in chemistry","(6) 178",2018,"Judite R M","Coimbra","JRM","Laboratory of Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Coimbra Coimbra, Portugal."

Concomitantly, gnetin C reduced intracellular Aβ oligomers (ca. 15 and 130 kDa) and elevated both levels of intracellular and extracellular Aβ monomers. Under the treatment with or without Aβ42, gnetin C upregulated the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-14 (MMP-14) which is assumed to be an Aβ-decomposing enzyme. Gnetin C may thereby prevent Aβ toxicity by suppressing BACE1 and enhancing MMP-14, together with reducing both internalization and oligomerization of exogenous Aβ monomers.

In this review, we provide an overview of the biosynthesis of bisecting GlcNAc and its physiological and pathological functions, particularly in the nervous system where bisecting GlcNAc is most highly expressed. The biosynthetic enzyme of bisecting GlcNAc is N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-III (GnT-III). Overexpression, knockdown, and knockout of GnT-III have so far revealed various functions of bisecting GlcNAc, which are mediated by regulating the functions of key carrier proteins. GnT-III-deficient AD model mice showed reduced amyloid-β (Aβ) accumulation in the brain by suppressing the function of a key Aβ-generating enzyme, β-site APP-cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE1), and greatly improved AD pathology. Altered BACE1 subcellular localization in GnT-III-deficient cells, from early endosomes to lysosomes, suggests that bisecting GlcNAc serves as a trafficking tag for the movement of modified proteins to an endosomal compartment. For therapeutic application, we have employed high-throughput screening to search for GnT-III inhibitors.

Overt accumulation and aggregation of the amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) is thought to be the initial causative factor for Alzheimer's disease. Aβ is produced by sequential proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein. Beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is the initial and rate-limiting protease for the generation of Aβ. Therefore, inhibiting BACE1 is considered one of the most promising therapeutic approaches for potential treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Currently, several drugs blocking this enzyme (BACE inhibitors) are being evaluated in clinical trials. However, high-dosage BACE-inhibitor treatment interferes with structural and functional synaptic plasticity in mice. These adverse side effects may mask the therapeutic benefit of lowering the Aβ concentration.

The present study aims to investigate how amyloid acts on the key elements of neurodegeneration and the molecules involved in the induction of Aβ1-42 production. For this purpose, we investigated the acute effect of Aβ1-42 on the transcriptional levels of genes that have roles in the mechanisms that produce Aβ itself: alpha secretase (ADAM10), beta secretase (BACE1), the gamma secretase complex (PS-1, PS-2, Nicastrin), the substrate APP, APOE (the significant risk factor for sporadic form of the AD), TREM2 (recently indicated as a contributor to AD risk), NMDAR subunits and PKCzeta (contributors of memory and learning), and key elements of tau pathology such as tau, GSK3α, GSK3β, and Cdk5. Additionally, we examined cholecalciferol metabolism-related enzyme 1α-hydroxylase (1αOHase) in primary cortical neurons with qRT-PCR. Our results indicate that Aβ1-42 has an effect on most of the target genes. This effect involves regulation of the amyloidogenic pathway in a complex manner, specifically, a general downregulation in NMDARs, ApoE, Trem2, and 1αOHase genes, and general up-regulation of tau pathway-related genes. We speculate that the presence of Aβ impacts the neurons not only with toxic events but also at the transcriptional level. The nuclear localization of Aβ1-42 and its regulatory effects on the target genes that we investigated in present study indicates Aβ1-42 as a transcriptional regulator of genes related to neurodegeneration.","1559-1174","Neuromolecular medicine","(20) 363-375",2018,"Duygu","Gezen-Ak","D","Brain and Neurodegenerative Disorders Research Laboratory, Department of Medical Biology, Cerrahpasa Faculty of Medicine, Istanbul University, 34098, Istanbul, Turkey."

Mice were fed with a diet supplemented with 100 mg/kg of resveratrol from 2 months of age during 10 months. Resveratrol administration induced complete protection against memory loss and brain pathology in 3xTg-AD mice, and also induced cognitive enhancement in healthy NoTg mice. Resveratrol improved exploration and reduced anxiety in both mouse strains, indicative of well-being. Resveratrol reduced the presence of Aβ and p-tau pathology in the hippocampus of the 3xTg-AD mouse. Proteostasis analysis showed the following in both NoTg and 3xTg-AD mice: (i) increased levels of the amyloid-degrading enzyme neprilysin, (ii) reduction of the amyloidogenic secretase BACE1, and (iii) increase of proteasome protein levels and enhancement of proteasome activity. Resveratrol also increased AMPK protein levels, then upregulating the SIRT1 pathway, as shown by the activation of PGC-1α and CREB in both mice, resulting in further beneficial changes. Our data demonstrated that resveratrol induces cognitive enhancement and neuroprotection against amyloid and tau pathologies. Improvement of proteostasis by resveratrol, in both healthy and AD mice, suggests that it is a mechanism of brain resilience and defense against neurodegeneration caused by the accumulation of aberrant proteins.","1559-1182","Molecular neurobiology","(56) 1502-1516",2019,"Rubén","Corpas","R","Institut d'Investigacions Biomèdiques de Barcelona (IIBB), CSIC and IDIBAPS, Barcelona, Spain. ruben.corpas@iibb.csic.es."

We have previously reported an enhanced processing of β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β-secretase (BACE1), a key enzyme in the pathogenesis of AD, in NPC1-null cells. In this work, we characterized regional and temporal expression and processing of the recently identified BACE1 substrates seizure protein 6 (Sez6) and seizure 6-like protein (Sez6L), and APP, in NPC1-/- (NPC1) and NPC1+/+ (wt) mouse brains. We analysed 4-weeks old brains to detect the earliest changes associated with NPC, and 10-weeks of age to identify changes at terminal disease stage. Sez6 and Sez6L were selected due to their predominant cleavage by BACE1, and their potential role in synaptic function that may contribute to presentation of seizures and/or motor impairments in NPC patients. While an enhanced BACE1-cleavage of all three substrates was detected in NPC1 vs. wt-mouse brains at 4-weeks of age, at 10-weeks increased proteolysis by BACE1 was observed for Sez6L in the cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum of NPC1-mice. Interestingly, both APP and Sez6L were found to be expressed in Purkinje neurons and their immunostaining was lost upon Purkinje cell neurodegeneration in 10-weeks old NPC1 mice. Furthermore, in NPC1- vs. wt-mouse primary cortical neurons, both Sez6 and Sez6L showed increased punctuate staining within the endolysosomal pathway as well as increased Sez6L and BACE1-positive puncta. This indicates that a trafficking defect within the endolysosomal pathway may play a key role in enhanced BACE1-proteolysis in NPC disease. Overall, our findings suggest that enhanced proteolysis by BACE1 could be a part of NPC disease pathogenesis. Understanding the basic biology of BACE1 and the functional impact of cleavage of its substrates is important to better evaluate the therapeutic potential of BACE1 against AD and, possibly, NPC disease.","1932-6203","PloS one","(13) e0200344",2018,"Mirsada","Causevic","M","Laboratory for Neurodegenerative Disease Research, Division of Molecular Medicine, Ruder Boskovic Institute, Zagreb, Croatia."

Biliverdin reductase-A (BVR-A) is a unique Ser/Thr/Tyr kinase regulating insulin signalling. Studies from our group, demonstrated that BVR-A impairment is among the earliest events favoring brain insulin resistance development. Furthermore, reported a negative association between BVR-A protein levels/activation and BACE1 protein levels in the parietal cortex of aged beagles (an animal model of AD), thus suggesting a possible interaction. Therefore, we aimed to demonstrate that BVR-A impairment is a molecular bridge linking brain insulin resistance with increased Aβ production. Age-associated changes of BVR-A, BACE1, insulin signalling cascade and APP processing were evaluated in the parietal cortex of beagles and experiments to confirm the hypothesized mechanism(s) have been performed in vitro in HEK293APPswe cells. Our results show that BVR-A impairment occurs early with age and is associated with brain insulin resistance. Furthermore, we demonstrate that BVR-A impairment favors CK1-mediated Ser phosphorylation of BACE1 (known to mediate BACE1 recycling to plasma membrane) along with increased Aβ production in the parietal cortex, with age. Overall, our results suggest that the impairment of BVR-A is an early molecular event contributing to both (I) the onset of brain insulin resistance and (II) the increased Aβ production observed in AD. We, therefore, suggest that by targeting BVR-A activity it could be possible to delay the onset of brain insulin resistance along with an improved regulation of the APP processing.","1879-260X","Biochimica et biophysica acta.

The β-secretase (beta amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleaving enzyme 1, BACE1) is one of the enzymes involved in the cleavage of APP that leads to the Aβ formation and it is the primary target for the treatment of AD. Recent report outlines that verubecestat molecule strongly inhibits BACE1; however, its structure, binding mechanism and the stability in the active site of BACE1 are not yet known. The present study aims to determine the structure, binding affinity and the stability of verubecestat molecule in the active site of BACE1 from the molecular docking, quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM)-based charge density analysis and molecular dynamics simulation. Verubecestat molecule was docked at BACE1; it shows high binding affinity towards BACE1. Further, the conformational geometry and the intermolecular interactions of verubecestat in the active site of BACE1 were determined. The molecule forms strong interaction with the neighboring amino acids in the active site of BACE1. The onsite QM/MM-based charge density analysis reveals the nature of charge density distribution and the topological properties of intermolecular interactions of verubecestat molecule in the active site of BACE1. The calculated electrostatic potential (ESP) of verubecestat in the active site of BACE1 displays high negative and positive ESP regions of the molecule. This onsite QM/MM analysis is more relevant to the physiological situation. The molecular dynamics simulation has been performed, which confirms the high stability and compactness of verubecestat in the active site of BACE1.

Phloroglucinol is a polyphenol component of phlorotannin, which is found at sufficient levels in Ecklonia cava (E. cava). Phloroglucinol has been reported to exert antioxidant activities in various tissues. Previously, we reported that the stereotaxic injection of phloroglucinol regulated synaptic plasticity in an AD mouse model. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effects of oral administration of phloroglucinol in AD. The oral administration of phloroglucinol for 2 months attenuated the impairments in cognitive function observed in 6-month-old 5X familial AD (5XFAD) mice, as assessed with the T-maze and Y-maze tests. The administration of phloroglucinol for 2 months in 5XFAD mice caused a reduction in the number of amyloid plaques and in the protein level of BACE1, a major amyloid precursor protein cleavage enzyme, together with γ-secretase. Phloroglucinol also restored the reduction in dendritic spine density and the number of mature spines in the hippocampi of 5XFAD mice. In addition, phloroglucinol-administered 5XFAD mice displayed lower protein levels of GFAP and Iba-1 and mRNA levels of TNF-α and IL-6 compared with vehicle-administered 5XFAD mice. These results demonstrated that phloroglucinol alleviated the neuropathological features and behavioral phenotypes in the 5XFAD mouse model. Taken together, our results suggest that phloroglucinol has therapeutic potential for AD treatment.","1873-4596","Free radical biology & medicine","(126) 221-234",2018,"Eun-Jeong","Yang","EJ","Department of Pharmacology, Seoul National University, College of Medicine, 103 Daehakro, Jongro-gu, Seoul 03080, Republic of Korea; Department of Biomedical Sciences, Seoul National University, College of Medicine, 103 Daehakro, Jongro-gu, Seoul 03080, Republic of Korea."

However the details of the interactions of APP with the enzymes and transportation of catalytic products are unclear. Here we reveal distinctive targeting patterns of the proteins in subcellular organelles in N2A cells. We find all three proteins co-localize in endosomes with APP and PSEN1 co-localize and associate on cell membrane and nucleus. By selectively knocking down BACE1 or PSEN 1 with siRNA, we discover that BACE1 functions as the enzyme initiating the first cleavage step and serves a scaffold for APP and PSEN1 endocytosis. PSEN1 knocking-down only leads to the reduction of BACE1 in cell membrane and nucleus. We conclude that BACE1 facilitates the transportation of APP and formation of the complex with γ-secretase, resulting in the stepwise cleavages of APP. After BACE1 cleavage APP binds to PSEN1 and transfers to cell membrane or nucleus for final processing and amyloid genesis.","1872-7972","Neuroscience letters","(685) 63-67",2018,"Mingguang","Wang","M","Department of Neurology, Xuzhou Children's Hospital, 18 Suti North Road, Xuzhou, 221006, China."

MiR-16 was abnormally downregulated and may be related to the development of AD. However, the functional role and molecular mechanism of miR-16 in AD pathogenesis are still not well elucidated. The expressions of miR-16 and β-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) mRNA and protein levels in AD brain tissues and Aβ-treated PC12 cellular AD model were examined by qRT-PCR and western blot analyses. Luciferase reporter assay was used to verify the potential target of miR-16. The cell viability, apoptosis, and caspase-3 activity in PC12 cells were determined by the MTT assay, flow cytometry analysis, and caspase-3 activity assay, respectively. Downregulation of miR-16 and upregulation of BACE1 existed in AD tissues and the cellular AD model of PC12. In addition, miR-16 directly suppressed BACE1 expression. Moreover, miR-16 overexpression and BACE1 knockdown facilitated Aβ-induced cell toxicity, apoptosis, and caspase-3 activity in N2a cells, which was partially eliminated by overexpression of BACE1. In contrast, BACE1 knockdown reversed the miR-16 inhibition-mediated inhibitory effect on Aβ-induced cell toxicity, apoptosis, and caspase-3 activity in PC12 cells. Collectively, miR-16 attenuated Aβ-induced neurotoxicity through targeting BACE1 in an Aβ insult cellular AD model, providing a potential therapeutic target for AD treatment.","1473-558X","Neuroreport","(29) 1365-1372",2018,"Zhigang","Zhong","Z","Department of Neurology, the First Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou."

Therefore, sensitive detection of BACE1 is essential for AD treatment and drug discovery. In this work, a facile and sensitive fluorescence biosensing platform was developed for BACE1 detection. This sensing platform was constituted based on the interaction between a WS2 nanosheet and a peptide sequence. In the absence of BACE1, a FAM-labeled peptide substrate could be adsorbed on the surface of the WS2 nanosheet, thereby quenching its fluorescence. However, in the presence of BACE1, the hydrolysis of the peptide substrate by BACE1 triggers could occur with the subsequent release of short FAM-linked peptide fragments which could not be adsorbed on the surface of the WS2 nanosheet. This resulted in weak fluorescence quenching, thus restoring the fluorescence signal. By measuring the change in the fluorescence of the FAM-labeled peptide substrate, the fluorescence sensing platform based on the WS2 nanosheet could monitor BACE1. The proposed WS2 nanosheet-based platform exhibited excellent specificity and high sensitivity with a detection limit of 66 pM for BACE1. Importantly, we also demonstrated that this platform was suitable for the screening of BACE1 inhibitors. The proposed sensing platform not only provides a novel strategy for the BACE1 assay but also offers a potential tool for screening drugs.","1364-5528","The Analyst","(143) 4585-4591",2018,"Xianwei","Zuo","X","State Key Laboratory of Applied Organic Chemistry, Lanzhou University, Lanzhou 730000, China. chenxg@lzu.edu.cn."

Here we show that water dynamics and interactions can be controlled by the protonation state of ligand using continuous constant pH molecular dynamics simulations of two closely related model systems, β-secretase 1 and 2 (BACE1 and BACE2), in complex with a small-molecule inhibitor. Simulations revealed that, upon binding, the inhibitor pyrimidine ring remains deprotonated in BACE1 but becomes protonated in BACE2. Pyrimidine protonation results in water displacement, rigidification of the binding pocket, and shift in the ligand binding mode from water-mediated to direct hydrogen bonding. These findings not only support but also rationalize the most recent structure-selectivity data in BACE1 drug design. Binding-induced protonation state changes are likely common; our work offers a glimpse at how modeling protein-ligand binding while allowing ligand titration can further advance the understanding of water and structure-based drug design.","1948-7185","The journal of physical chemistry letters","(9) 5440-5444",2018,"Jack A","Henderson","JA","Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences , University of Maryland School of Pharmacy , Baltimore , Maryland 21201 , United States."

These aggregates hinder the electrochemical transmission at neuronal junctions and thus deteriorate neuronal-health by triggering dementia. Electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions among amino-acid residues are the governing principle behind the self-assembly of aforesaid noxious oligomers or agglomerate. Interestingly, lysine residues are crucial for these interactions and for facilitating the clearance of toxic metabolites through the ubiquitination process. The mechanisms behind lysine selectivity and modifications of target proteins are very intriguing process and an avenue to explore the clearance of unwanted proteins from neurons. Therefore, it is fascinating for the researchers to investigate the role of key lysine, their selectivity and interactions with other amino acids to clear-off toxic products in exempting the progression of Neurodegenerative disorders (NDDs).

Rat models were established and then transfected with BACE1 small interfering RNA and wortmannin (an inhibitor of PI3K). Blood gas analysis was performed, and a series of behavioral experiments were conducted to evaluate the cognitive function, learning ability and locomotor activity of rats. Reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis were employed to determine the mRNA and protein expression of the associated genes. An ELISA was used to detect the inflammatory indicators and the content of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and amyloid‑β (Aβ). Apoptosis of the hippocampal CA1 region was observed by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick‑end labeling staining. Initially, it was revealed that the percentage of stagnation time in rats was increased by BACE1 gene silencing; the escape latency and swimming distance were markedly reduced from the 4th to the 6th day, the time the rats spent in first passing the target area was shortened, and the times of passing the target area were increased by BACE1 gene silencing, demonstrating that BACE1 gene silencing enhanced the spatial memory ability of rats. Additionally, it was determined that silencing BACE1 improved the pathological state induced by isoflurane anesthesia in immature rats, and attenuated the inflammatory response and the levels of APP and Aβ in hippocampal tissues. Furthermore, it was suggested that silencing BACE1 may have promoted the activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, thereby inhibiting the apoptosis of the hippocampal CA1 region.

Glutamate (125 μM) produced hyperphosphorylation of tau in cortical primary cultures along with increased apoptotic nuclei, LDH release, and cPLA2 expression, which were all reversed by BACE1-KD. This beneficial effect was reinforced by the silencing of cPLA2 but attenuated by the reduction in SCD1 and partially attenuated by the reduction in FAD6. Inversely, overexpression SCD1 and FAD6 recovered the neuroprotective effect produced by BACE1-KD, which was not achieved by the overexpression of each desaturase alone.

30382187,"δ-Secretase-cleaved Tau stimulates Aβ production via upregulating STAT1-BACE1 signaling in Alzheimer's disease.","δ-Secretase, an age-dependent asparagine protease, cleaves both amyloid precursor protein (APP) and Tau and is required for amyloid plaque and neurofibrillary tangle pathologies in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, whether δ-secretase activation is sufficient to trigger AD pathogenesis remains unknown. Here we show that the fragments of δ-secretase-cleavage, APP (586-695) and Tau(1-368), additively drive AD pathogenesis and cognitive dysfunctions. Tau(1-368) strongly augments BACE1 expression and Aβ generation in the presence of APP. The Tau(1-368) fragment is more robust than full-length Tau in binding active STAT1, a BACE1 transcription factor, and promotes its nuclear translocation, upregulating BACE1 and Aβ production. Notably, Aβ-activated SGK1 or JAK2 kinase phosphorylates STAT1 and induces its association with Tau(1-368). Inhibition of these kinases diminishes stimulatory effect of Tau(1-368). Knockout of STAT1 abolishes AD pathologies induced by δ-secretase-generated APP and Tau fragments. Thus, we show that Tau may not only be a downstream effector of Aβ in the amyloid hypothesis, but also act as a driving force for Aβ, when cleaved by δ-secretase.","1476-5578","Molecular psychiatry","(26) 586-603",2021,"Zhentao","Zhang","Z","Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, 30322, USA."
30386171,"Early Life Stress and Epigenetics in Late-onset Alzheimer's Dementia: A Systematic Review.","Involvement of life stress in Late-Onset Alzheimer's Disease (LOAD) has been evinced in longitudinal cohort epidemiological studies, and endocrinologic evidence suggests involvements of catecholamine and corticosteroid systems in LOAD. Early Life Stress (ELS) rodent models have successfully demonstrated sequelae of maternal separation resulting in LOAD-analogous pathology, thereby supporting a role of insulin receptor signalling pertaining to GSK-3beta facilitated tau hyper-phosphorylation and amyloidogenic processing. Discussed are relevant ELS studies, and findings from three mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways (JNK/SAPK pathway, ERK pathway, p38/MAPK pathway) relevant for mediating environmental stresses. Further considered were the roles of autophagy impairment, neuroinflammation, and brain insulin resistance. For the meta-analytic evaluation, 224 candidate gene loci were extracted from reviews of animal studies of LOAD pathophysiological mechanisms, of which 60 had no positive results in human LOAD association studies. These loci were combined with 89 gene loci confirmed as LOAD risk genes in previous GWAS and WES. Of the 313 risk gene loci evaluated, there were 35 human reports on epigenomic modifications in terms of methylation or histone acetylation. 64 microRNA gene regulation mechanisms were published for the compiled loci. Genomic association studies support close relations of both noradrenergic and glucocorticoid systems with LOAD. For HPA involvement, a CRHR1 haplotype with MAPT was described, but further association of only HSD11B1 with LOAD found; however, association of FKBP1 and NC3R1 polymorphisms was documented in support of stress influence to LOAD. In the brain insulin system, IGF2R, INSR, INSRR, and plasticity regulator ARC, were associated with LOAD. Pertaining to compromised myelin stability in LOAD, relevant associations were found for BIN1, RELN, SORL1, SORCS1, CNP, MAG, and MOG. Regarding epigenetic modifications, both methylation variability and de-acetylation were reported for LOAD. The majority of up-to-date epigenomic findings include reported modifications in the well-known LOAD core pathology loci MAPT, BACE1, APP (with FOS, EGR1), PSEN1, PSEN2, and highlight a central role of BDNF. Pertaining to ELS, relevant loci are FKBP5, EGR1, GSK3B; critical roles of inflammation are indicated by CRP, TNFA, NFKB1 modifications; for cholesterol biosynthesis, DHCR24; for myelin stability BIN1, SORL1, CNP; pertaining to (epi)genetic mechanisms, hTERT, MBD2, DNMT1, MTHFR2. Findings on gene regulation were accumulated for BACE1, MAPK signalling, TLR4, BDNF, insulin signalling, with most reports for miR-132 and miR-27.

We previously reported that pseudoginsenoside-F11 (PF11), an ocotillol-type saponin, improved cognitive function and reduced Aβ aggregation in APP/PS1 mice, a familial AD model. Here, we chose senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8) mice, a widely used model of aging, to investigate the effect of PF11 on sporadic AD. PF11 was orally administered to male 6-month-old SAMP8 mice for 3 months. Consistent with previous studies, SAMP8 mice showed several AD-type pathologies including cognitive impairment, Aβ deposition and tau hyperphosphorylation. We found increased protein levels of cytoplasmic amyloid precursor protein (APP) and β-site APP cleavage enzyme 1 (BACE1) in the hippocampus and cortex of SAMP8 mice. The protein level of demethylated protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) was elevated in SAMP8 animals and the protein level of leucine carboxyl methyltransferase 1 (LCMT-1) was reduced. PF11 attenuated learning and memory impairments in the novel object recognition test and Morris water maze. PF11 promoted the transport of APP from cytoplasm to plasma membrane and decreased the abnormally high expression of BACE1 in hippocampus and cortex of SAMP8 mice. The elevated protein level of demethylated PP2A and the reduced expression of LCMT-1 in hippocampus and cortex of SAMP8 were also attenuated by PF11. Together, our findings indicate that PF11 has beneficial effects on AD-like pathological changes in SAMP8 mice and may act by inhibiting amyloidogenic processing of APP and attenuating tau hyperphosphorylation.","1096-1186","Pharmacological research","(139) 512-523",2019,"Zhen","Zhang","Z","Department of Pharmacology, Shenyang Pharmaceutical University, Shenyang, PR China."

30411846,"Carbon monoxide attenuates amyloidogenesis via down-regulation of NF-κB-mediated BACE1 gene expression.","Amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides, the major constituent of plaques, are generated by sequential proteolytic cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) via β-secretase (BACE1) and the γ-secretase complex. It has been proposed that the abnormal secretion and accumulation of Aβ are the initial causative events in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Drugs modulating this pathway could be used for AD treatment. Previous studies indicated that carbon monoxide (CO), a product of heme oxygenase (HO)-1, protects against Aβ-induced toxicity and promotes neuroprotection. However, the mechanism underlying the mitigative effect of CO on Aβ levels and BACE1 expression is unclear. Here, we show that CO modulates cleavage of APP and Aβ production by decreasing BACE1 expression in vivo and in vitro. CO reduces Aβ levels and improves memory deficits in AD transgenic mice. The regulation of BACE1 expression by CO is dependent on nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB). Consistent with the negative role of SIRT1 in the NF-κB activity, CO fails to evoke significant decrease in BACE1 expression in the presence of the SIRT1 inhibitor. Furthermore, CO attenuates elevation of BACE1 level in brains of 3xTg-AD mouse model as well as mice fed high-fat, high-cholesterol diets. CO reduces the NF-κB-mediated transcription of BACE1 induced by the cholesterol oxidation product 27-hydroxycholesterol or hydrogen peroxide. These data suggest that CO reduces the NF-κB-mediated BACE1 transcription and consequently decreases Aβ production. Our study provides novel mechanisms by which CO reduces BACE1 expression and Aβ production and may be an effective agent for AD treatment.","1474-9726","Aging cell","(18) e12864",2019,"Hyo Jeong","Kim","HJ","Meta-Inflammation Research Institute of Basic Research, School of Biological Sciences, University of Ulsan, Ulsan, South Korea."

Our study aimed to have a deep insight into the roles and molecular basis of miR-128 in the development and progression of AD. The cognitive ability and exploratory behaviors were assessed by morris water maze and open-field tests, respectively. The concentrations of amyloid-β (Aβ) 40, Aβ 42, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-10 and activity of β-secretase and α-secretase were determined by corresponding ELISA commercial kits. RT-qPCR assay was performed to detect miR-128 level and the mRNA expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ), ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (Iba1) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP). Western blot assay was conducted to determine protein expression of PPARγ, amyloid precursor protein (APP), β-APP cleaving enzyme (BACE1), sAPPα and sAPPβ. The effect of miR-128 and PPARγ on amyloid plaque formation was assessed by immunohistochemistry assay. PPARγ mean optical density was determined by immunofluorescence assay. The interaction between miR-128 and PPARγ were validated by bioinformatics analysis and luciferase reporter assay. We found AD mice showed AD-like performance and an increased cerebral cortex Aβ production. MiR-128 expression was upregulated and PPARγ expression was downregulated in cerebral cortex of AD mice. Moreover, PPARγ was a target of miR-128. Additionally, miR-128 knockout or PPARγ upregulation inhibited AD-like performances, amyloid plaque formation, Aβ generation, APP amyloidogenic processing and inflammatory responses in AD mice, while these effects of miR-128 knockout were abrogated by PPARγ inhibitor. The results indicated MiR-128 knockout weakened AD-like performances, and reduced Aβ production and inflammatory responses by targeting PPARγ in AD mice.","1879-0712","European journal of pharmacology","(843) 134-144",2019,"Yanqiu","Liu","Y","Department of Neurology, PLA ﻿9﻿6﻿0﻿ ﻿H﻿o﻿s﻿p﻿i﻿t﻿a﻿l, Zibo, Shandong 255300, China."
30424732,"Biaryl scaffold-focused virtual screening for anti-aggregatory and neuroprotective effects in Alzheimer's disease.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a primary cause of dementia in ageing population affecting more than 35 million people around the globe. It is a chronic neurodegenerative disease caused by defected folding and aggregation of amyloid beta (Aβ) protein. Aβ is formed by the cleavage of membrane embedded amyloid precursor protein (APP) by using enzyme 'transmembrane aspartyl protease, β-secretase'. Inhibition of β-secretase is a viable strategy to prevent neurotoxicity in AD. Another strategy in the treatment of AD is inhibition of acetylcholinesterase. This inhibition reduces the degradation of acetylcholine and temporarily restores the cholinergic function of neurons and improves cognitive function. Monoamine oxidase and higher glutamate levels are also found to be linked with Aβ peptide related oxidative stress. Oxidative stress leads to reduced activity of glutamate synthase resulting in significantly higher level of glutamate in brain. The aim of this study is to perform in silico screening of a virtual library of biaryl scaffold containing compounds potentially used for the treatment of AD. Screening was done against the primary targets of AD therapeutics, acetylcholinesterase, β-secretase (BACE1), Monoamine oxidases (MAO) and N-Methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. Compounds were screened for their inhibitory potential by employing molecular docking approach using AutoDock vina.

As the localization and function of BACE2 in the brain remain unknown, it is difficult to predict whether relevant side effects can be caused by off-target inhibition of BACE2 and whether it is important to generate BACE1-specific inhibitors. Here, we show that BACE2 is expressed in discrete subsets of neurons and glia throughout the adult mouse brain. We uncover four new substrates processed by BACE2 in cultured glia: vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, delta and notch-like epidermal growth factor-related receptor, fibroblast growth factor receptor 1, and plexin domain containing 2. Although these substrates were not prominently cleaved by BACE2 in healthy adult mice, proinflammatory TNF induced a drastic increase in BACE2-mediated shedding of vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 in CSF. Thus, although under steady-state conditions the effect of BACE2 cross-inhibition by BACE1-directed inhibitors is rather subtle, it is important to consider that side effects might become apparent under physiopathological conditions that induce TNF expression.","2575-1077","Life science alliance","(1) e201800026",2018,"Iryna","Voytyuk","I","Department of Neurosciences, Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Leuven, Belgium."

Fluid biomarkers measured in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or blood hold promise for enabling more effective drug development and establishing a more personalized medicine approach for AD diagnosis and treatment. Biomarkers used in drug development programmes should be qualified for a specific context of use (COU). These COUs include, but are not limited to, subject/patient selection, assessment of disease state and/or prognosis, assessment of mechanism of action, dose optimization, drug response monitoring, efficacy maximization, and toxicity/adverse reactions identification and minimization. The core AD CSF biomarkers Aβ42, t-tau, and p-tau are recognized by research guidelines for their diagnostic utility and are being considered for qualification for subject selection in clinical trials. However, there is a need to better understand their potential for other COUs, as well as identify additional fluid biomarkers reflecting other aspects of AD pathophysiology. Several novel fluid biomarkers have been proposed, but their role in AD pathology and their use as AD biomarkers have yet to be validated.

Our results are the first to demonstrate that the level of plasma BACE1-NRG1 activity was significantly increased in subjects affected with schizophrenia compared with healthy controls. Interestingly, the elevated BACE1-NRG1 activity was correlated with the disease severity and duration of schizophrenia, such as patients suffering from shorter-term course and worse disease status expressed higher BACE1-NRG1 activity levels compared to whom with longer duration and less severity of the disease. Furthermore, this is also the first report that the alternation of BACE1-NRG1 activity was a substrate -specific event in schizophrenia.

BIN1 is an adaptor protein that regulates membrane dynamics in the context of endocytosis and membrane remodeling. An increase in BIN1 expression and changes in the relative levels of alternatively spliced BIN1 isoforms have been reported in the brains of patients with AD. BIN1 can bind to Tau, and an increase in BIN1 expression correlates with Tau pathology. In contrast, the loss of BIN1 expression in cultured cells elevates Aβ production and Tau propagation by insfluencing endocytosis and recycling. Here, we show that BIN1 accumulates adjacent to amyloid deposits in vivo. We found an increase in insoluble BIN1 and a striking accrual of BIN1 within and near amyloid deposits in the brains of multiple transgenic models of AD. The peri-deposit aberrant BIN1 localization was conspicuously different from the accumulation of APP and BACE1 within dystrophic neurites. Although BIN1 is highly expressed in mature oligodendrocytes, BIN1 association with amyloid deposits occurred in the absence of the accretion of other oligodendrocyte or myelin proteins. Finally, super-resolution microscopy and immunogold electron microscopy analyses highlight the presence of BIN1 in proximity to amyloid fibrils at the edges of amyloid deposits. These results reveal the aberrant accumulation of BIN1 is a feature associated with AD amyloid pathology. Our findings suggest a potential role for BIN1 in extracellular Aβ deposition in vivo that is distinct from its well-characterized function as an adaptor protein in endocytosis and membrane remodeling.","1750-3639","Brain pathology (Zurich, Switzerland)","(29) 485-501",2019,"Pierre","De Rossi","P","Department of Neurobiology, The University of Chicago, Chicago, IL."

In this study, we investigated the role of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its paralogue amyloid precursor-like protein 2 (APLP2) in myelination using APP and APLP2 knockout (KO) mice. Given that BACE1 regulates myelination and myelin sheath thickness in both the peripheral and central nervous systems, we sought to determine if APP and APLP2, as alternate BACE1 substrates, also modulate myelination, and therefore provide a better understanding of the events regulating axonal myelination. In the peripheral nervous system, we identified that adult, but not juvenile KO mice, have lower densities of myelinated axons in their sciatic nerves while in the central nervous system, axons within both the optic nerves and corpus callosum of both KO mice were significantly hypomyelinated compared to wild-type (WT) controls. Biochemical analysis demonstrated significant increases in BACE1 and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein and decreased NRG1 and proteolipid protein levels in both KO brain tissue. The acute cuprizone model of demyelination/remyelination revealed that whereas axons in the corpus callosum of WT and APLP2-KO mice underwent similar degrees of demyelination and subsequent remyelination, the myelinated callosal axons in APP-KO mice were less susceptible to cuprizone-induced demyelination and showed a failure in remyelination after cuprizone withdrawal. These data identified APP and APLP2 as modulators of normal myelination and demyelination/remyelination conditions.

It is thus recognized as a promising therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease treatment, and large efforts have been made in the discovery of novel BACE1 inhibitors. This Review presents a systematic mining of BACE1 inhibitors based on 354 crystal structures of the BACE1 catalytic domain in complex with ligands in the Protein Data Bank. A thorough exploration on the frequency as well as the patterns of residue-ligand interactions enables us to subdivide the ligand binding pocket into 10 subsites and then identify favorable substructures of ligands for each subsite. In addition, it is found that the assembly of subsites with an 8-like shape is responsible to bind all inhibitors and four major ligand binding modes are revealed. Thus, such a systematic survey deepens our understanding of the structural requirements for establishment of BACE1-ligand interactions that determine the affinity of a ligand to BACE1, which is pivotal for structure-based lead optimization and design of novel inhibitors.","1948-7193","ACS chemical neuroscience","(10) 880-889",2019,"Hangchen","Hu","H","CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research, Drug Discovery and Design Center , Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) , Shanghai 201203 , China."

The normal control group consisted of 10 non-transgenic mice. The stem cell treatment group was injected with BMSCs, and the two control groups were given the same volume of normal saline. The Morris water maze test was used to compare the memory function of mice, and the relative expression levels of β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and α-2-macroglobulin (A2M) genes were detected by fluorescence quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Amyloid β (Aβ)1-42 content in brain tissues of mice and inflammatory cytokines, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) were detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Compared with that in the AD control group, the escape latency in the water maze in the stem cell treatment group was shortened, the time of crossing the ring for the first time was decreased, but the frequency of crossing the ring was increased (P<0.05). Aβ1-42 content in the AD control group was higher than that in the stem cell treatment group and the normal control group (P<0.05). The relative expression level of BACE1 gene in the stem cell treatment group was lower than that in the AD control group (P<0.05), but that of A2M gene was increased (P<0.05). At 14 days after treatment, the contents of IL-1, IL-2, TNF-α and IFN-γ in blood in the stem cell treatment group were lower than those in the AD control group (P<0.05).

Emerging evidence shows that saturated fat-enriched diets, such as palmitate-enriched diets, increase amyloid-beta (Aβ) production, the histopathological hallmark of AD. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie the deleterious effects of palmitate-enriched diets in the augmentation of Aβ genesis are yet to be characterized. Sterol response element binding protein 1 (SREBP1) is a transcription factor that is modulated by saturated fatty acids, such as palmitate, and consequently regulates the expression of genes that code for proteins involved in almost all facets of lipid metabolism. Herein, we determined the role of changes in SREBP1 expression and transcriptional activity in the palmitate-induced effects on Aβ genesis and BACE1 expression, the enzyme that catalyzes the rate-limiting step in Aβ biosynthesis. We demonstrate that palmitate-induced SREBP1 activation directly regulates BACE1 expression at the transcriptional level in the mouse hippocampus and mouse Neuro-2a (N2a) neuroblastoma cells. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies show that palmitate increases the binding of SREBP1 to the Bace1 promoter region in the mouse hippocampus and mouse N2a neuroblastoma cells. Ectopic expression of the dominant negative SREBP1 mutant and knocking-down SREBP1 expression significantly reduced the palmitate-induced increase in BACE1 expression and subsequent Aβ genesis in mouse N2a neuroblastoma cells.

Aβ aggregates from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the sequential action of β-Secretase (Beta site APP Cleaving Enzyme, BACE1); hence, inhibition of BACE1 is the primary target for the treatment of AD. As per the experimental report, acylguanidine is a synthetic inhibitor of BACE1, it exhibits high binding affinity towards BACE1. In the present computational study, we aimed to understand the molecular binding mechanism of acylguanidine with BACE1 from the structure and conformation, intermolecular interactions, charge density and electrostatic properties, stability and binding free energy of acylguanidine molecule in the active site of BACE1. To investigate this, molecular docking, QM/MM based charge density analysis and MD simulation have been performed on acylguanidine with BACE1. Acylguanidine shows large binding affinity towards BACE1 and it gives strong hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions with the active site amino acid residues of BACE1. In addition, QM/MM based charge density analysis of acylguanidine was carried out to understand its charge density distribution in the active site of BACE1. The conformational flexibility, charge density redistribution and the modification of electrostatic properties of acylguanidine in the active site have been compared to its corresponding gas phase structure. Further, the molecular dynamics simulation on acylguanidine-BACE1 was carried out, which gives the stability of acylguanidine in the active site of BACE1.

Inhibition of Aβ production by β-secretase (BACE) has been proposed as a potential therapeutic strategy for AD. However, BACE inhibitors lack specificity and have had limited clinical benefit. To better study the consequences of reducing BACE metabolism, specifically of APP, we used an antibody, 2B3, that binds to APP at the BACE cleavage site, inhibiting Aβ production. 2B3 was administered either directly into the lateral ventricles or by intraperitoneal injection to (platelet-derived growth factor promoter hAPP717V (PDAPP) mice and WT mice. 2B3 reduced soluble Aβ40 and βCTF (β-amyloid derived C-terminal fragment) and improved memory for object-in-place associations and working memory in a foraging task in PDAPP mice. 2B3 also normalized the phosphorylation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor NR2B subunit and subsequent extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling. The importance of this NR2B pathway for OiP memory was confirmed by administering the NR2B antagonist, Ro25-6981, to 18-month-old WT. In contrast, 2B3 impaired associative recognition memory in young WT mice.

Overexpression of miR-338-5p in the hippocampus of TG mice reduced BACE1 expression, Aβ formation, and neuroinflammation. Overexpression of miR-338-5p functionally prevented impairments in long-term synaptic plasticity, learning ability, and memory retention in TG mice.

Because β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) is the pathological hallmark of AD, the aim of this study is to verify whether 27-OHC could lead to cognitive impairment through modulating Aβ accumulation and deposition. Regulation of Aβ metabolism was explored as the pathogenic mechanism of 27-OHC. Furthermore, microRNAs (miRNAs) and their relations with 27-OHC were also detected. In present study, matched case-control study and APP/PS1 transgenic mice research were conducted. The results showed that the 27-OHC and Aβ in plasma were increased in mild cognitive impairment patients, and a slight correlation was found between 27-OHC and Aβ1-40. This relationship was also proved by the research of APP/PS1 mice. More severe learning and memory impairment and higher Aβ1-40 expression in brain and plasma were detected in the APP/PS1 mice of 27-OHC treatment group. In addition, increased amyloid plaques were also found in the hippocampus of 27-OHC-treated mice. In order to find out the mechanism of 27-OHC on regulating Aβ metabolism, the factors of Aβ production (APP, BACE1 and ADAM10), transport (LRP1 and RAGE) and elimination (NEP and IDE) were tested respectively. The gene and protein expressions of APP, BACE1 and RAGE were increased while LRP1 and IDE were decreased in the brain of 27-OHC-treated mice. At last, down-regulated expression of miRNA let-7g-5p was found after 27-OHC treatment. In conclusion, these findings suggested that excessive 27-OHC could enhance the accumulation and deposition of Aβ both in brain and blood, resulting in a severe impairment of cognition, especially in the modulation of Aβ1-40. The mechanism might be associated with the regulation of Aβ metabolism, and miRNA let-7g-5p was likely to play a vital role in this pathological process induced by 27-OHC.","1750-3639","Brain pathology (Zurich, Switzerland)","(29) 558-573",2019,"Xiaona","Zhang","X","School of Public Health, Beijing Key Laboratory of Environmental Toxicology, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China."

However, RTN3 aggregates easily, which offsets RTN3's inhibitory effect on BACE1 activity and exacerbates AP deposition. We found that BAP31 was a binding partner of RTN3 and positively correlated with the expression level of RTN3. To further explore how BAP31 is involved in Alzheimer's disease (AD), conditional knockout mice with targeted BAP31 deletion (B-KO) in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex were generated and hybridized with amyloid precursor protein (APP) PS1 transgenic (AD model) mice to obtain B-KO-AD mice. BAP31 knock out in primary hippocampal neurons decreased RTN3 monomer availability and enhanced the level of RTN3 aggregates, indicating that BAP31 deficiency increases the instability of RTN3. More importantly, these effects contributed to BACE1-mediated APP processing and were responsible for the increased APs in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of B-KO-AD mice. Thus, elevated expression of BAP31 in the human brain is likely to reduce the formation of both RTN3 aggregates and Aβ by enhancing the stability of RTN3.-Wang, T., Chen, J., Hou, Y., Yu, Y., Wang, B.

The isolated complex responded properly to γ-secretase modulators. Alzheimer's-causing mutations in presenilin altered the Aβ42/40 peptide ratio generated by the HMW β/γ-secretase complex indistinguishably from that observed in whole cells.

Membrane trafficking plays a key role in the regulation of APP processing as both APP and the processing secretases traffic along distinct pathways. Genome wide sequencing studies have identified several AD susceptibility genes which regulate membrane trafficking events. To understand the pathogenesis of AD it is critical that the cell biology of APP and Aβ production in neurons is well defined. This review discusses recent advances in unravelling the membrane trafficking events associated with the production of Aβ, and how AD susceptible alleles may perturb the sorting and transport of APP and BACE1. Mechanisms whereby inflammation may influence APP processing are also considered.","1879-2642","Biochimica et biophysica acta.

Here, we report that 3K3A-APC inhibits BACE1 amyloidogenic pathway in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We show that a 4-mo daily treatment of 3-mo-old 5XFAD mice with murine recombinant 3K3A-APC (100 µg/kg/d i.p.) prevents development of parenchymal and cerebrovascular amyloid-β (Aβ) deposits by 40-50%, which is mediated through NFκB-dependent transcriptional inhibition of BACE1, resulting in blockade of Aβ generation in neurons overexpressing human Aβ-precursor protein. Consistent with reduced Aβ deposition, 3K3A-APC normalized hippocampus-dependent behavioral deficits and cerebral blood flow responses, improved cerebrovascular integrity, and diminished neuroinflammatory responses. Our data suggest that 3K3A-APC holds potential as an effective anti-Aβ prevention therapy for early-stage AD.","1540-9538","The Journal of experimental medicine","(216) 279-293",2019,"Divna","Lazic","D","Zilkha Neurogenetic Institute, Keck School of Medicine, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA."

Activation of TFEB (transcription factor EB), a master regulator of the ALP, leads to ALP facilitation. The present study sought to clarify whether TFEB-mediated ALP facilitation influences the process of amyloid β-protein (Aβ) generation in neurons. TFEB was overexpressed in mature rat primary cortical neurons via recombinant adenoviruses, without (basal conditions) or with co-overexpression of wild-type amyloid precursor protein (APP) or its β-C-terminal fragment (β-CTF). We confirmed that TFEB overexpression upregulated the lysosomal proteins, cathepsin D and LAMP-1. In TFEB-expressing neurons, protein levels of ADAM10 were profoundly increased, whereas those of APP, BACE1, or γ-secretase complex proteins were unaffected. However, TFEB did not affect ADAM10 mRNA levels. TFEB overexpression had different effects on Aβ production depending on the expression level of APP or β-CTF: TFEB slightly decreased Aβ secretion under basal conditions; clearly increased α-CTF levels and marginally increased β-CTF levels with modest increases in secreted Aβ in APP-expressing neurons; and caused a remarkable increase in β-CTF levels with a significant increase in secreted Aβ in β-CTF-expressing neurons. Inhibition of proteasomes, but not lysosomes, markedly increased β-CTF levels in β-CTF-expressing neurons. These results collectively indicate that TFEB modulates Aβ production not only by increasing α-secretase processing of APP through ADAM10 upregulation but also by augmenting β-CTF levels possibly via altered proteasome-mediated catabolism. Thus, TFEB-mediated ALP enhancement appears to have dual, but opposite, effects on Aβ production in neurons.","1873-7544","Neuroscience","(402) 11-22",2019,"Fumiko","Yamamoto","F","Department of Demyelinating Disease and Aging, National Institute of Neuroscience, NCNP, Kodaira, Tokyo 187-8502, Japan; Department of Neurology, Faculty of Medicine, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8575, Japan."

Herein, we described the identification of plant based lead compounds for treatment of AD through an integrative approach of pharmacokinetics and structure bioinformatics approach. In particular we performed screening of lead compounds from 3 traditional medicinal plants namely Withania somnifera, Bacopa monnieri and Morus alba, which are known to have potential for treatment of neurodegenerative disease. We retrieved a total of 210 plant based compounds of which 21 compounds were screened based on their pharmacokinetic properties. Further, Docking study against 7 known AD associated targets were carried out to identify the binding sites and direct interacting residues. In addition we investigate the stable and reliable binding mechanism of top such plant compounds against 3 targets through molecular docking followed by Molecular Dynamic(MD) simulation. The results obtained in the study revealed that 3 drug compounds namely Morusin (MRSN), Withanone (WTHN) and 27-Hydroxywithanolide B (HWTHN) were identified as putative lead compounds against mono amine oxidase (MAOB), Beta-secretase 1(BACE1) and phosphodiesterase 4D.","1476-928X","Computational biology and chemistry","(78) 359-366",2019,"Kasmika","Borah","K","Bioinformatics Infrastructure Facility Center, Biological Sciences & Technology Division, CSIR-North-East Institute of Science and Technology, Jorhat, Assam, 785006, India.

The entorhinal cortex and the dentate gyrus are important for learning and memory, which are affected in the early stages of AD. Since BACE1 is a potential target for AD therapy, it is crucial to understand its physiological role in these brain regions. Here, we examined the function of BACE1 in the dentate gyrus. We show that loss of BACE1 in the dentate gyrus leads to increased granule cell excitability, indicated by enhanced efficiency of synaptic potentials to generate granule cell spikes. The increase in granule cell excitability was accompanied by prolonged paired-pulse inhibition, altered network gamma oscillations, and impaired synaptic plasticity at entorhinal-dentate synapses of the perforant path. In summary, this is the first detailed electrophysiological study of BACE1 deletion at the network level in vivo. The results suggest that BACE1 is important for normal dentate gyrus network function. This has implications for the use of BACE1 inhibitors as therapeutics for AD therapy, since BACE1 inhibition could similarly disrupt synaptic plasticity and excitability in the entorhinal-dentate circuitry.","1863-2661","Brain structure & function","(224) 1279-1290",2019,"Matej","Vnencak","M","Institute of Clinical Neuroanatomy, Neuroscience Center, Goethe University, Frankfurt am Main, Germany. matej.vnencak@tyks.fi."

While diets-enriched in the saturated free fatty acid (sFFA) palmitate has been shown to induce cognitive dysfunction and AD-like pathology, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) such as linoleate have been suggested to protect against AD in mouse models. However, the underlying cellular and molecular mechanisms that mediate the deleterious effects of palmitate or the protective effects of linoleate remain to be characterized. We fed 9-month-old cohorts of triple transgenic AD mice (3xTg-AD) and their-matched controls with a palmitate-enriched/linoleate-deficient diet for three months and determined the impact of the diet on oxidative stress, Bace1 promoter transactivation status, and amyloid-β (Aβ) burden. The palmitate-enriched/linoleate-deficient diet causes a profound increase in oxidative stress burden characterized by significant oxidative damage to lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids concomitant with deficits in the endogenous antioxidant defense capacity in the hippocampi of 3xTg-AD mice. These effects were also associated with increased NF-κB transcriptional activity resulting in NF-κB-mediated transactivation of the Bace1 promoter that culminated in higher BACE1 expression and activity, and Aβ production. Our study unveils a novel mechanism by which a diet enriched in the sFFA palmitate and deficient in the PUFA linoleate exacerbates AD-like pathology involving signaling cross-talk between oxidative stress and NF-κB activation as a critical underlying factor in upregulating BACE1 activity and increasing Aβ burden.","1875-8908","Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD","(68) 219-237",2019,"Gurdeep","Marwarha","G","Department of Biomedical Sciences, School of Medicine & Health Sciences, University of North Dakota, Grand Forks, ND, USA."

However, the specific role of brain microvascular cells in these anomalies remains elusive. In this study, we validated by Western, ELISA and immunofluorescence analyses a procedure to generate microvasculature-enriched fractions from frozen samples of human cerebral cortex. We then investigated Aβ and proteins involved in its clearance or production in microvessel extracts generated from the parietal cortex of 60 volunteers in the Religious Orders Study. Volunteers were categorized as AD (n = 38) or controls (n = 22) based on the ABC scoring method presented in the revised guidelines for the neuropathological diagnosis of AD. Higher ELISA-determined concentrations of vascular Aβ40 and Aβ42 were found in persons with a neuropathological diagnosis of AD, in apoE4 carriers and in participants with advanced parenchymal CAA, compared to respective age-matched controls. Vascular levels of two proteins involved in Aβ clearance, ABCB1 and neprilysin, were lower in persons with AD and positively correlated with cognitive function, while being inversely correlated to vascular Aβ40. In contrast, BACE1, a protein necessary for Aβ production, was increased in individuals with AD and in apoE4 carriers, negatively correlated to cognitive function and positively correlated to Aβ40 in microvessel extracts. The present report indicates that concentrating microvessels from frozen human brain samples facilitates the quantitative biochemical analysis of cerebrovascular dysfunction in CNS disorders. Data generated overall show that microvessels extracted from individuals with parenchymal CAA-AD contained more Aβ and BACE1 and less ABCB1 and neprilysin, evidencing a pattern of dysfunction in brain microvascular cells contributing to CAA and AD pathology and symptoms.","1432-0533","Acta neuropathologica","(137) 801-823",2019,"Philippe","Bourassa","P","Faculté de pharmacie, Université Laval, Quebec, QC, Canada."

Small molecule inhibitors of BACE1 are being tested in clinical trials for AD, but the safety and efficacy of BACE1 inhibition has yet to be fully explored. Knockout of the Bace1 gene in the germline of mice causes multiple neurological phenotypes, suggesting that BACE1 inhibition could be toxic. However, these phenotypes could be the result of BACE1 deficiency during development rather than due to the lack of BACE1 function in the adult. To address this problem, we generated tamoxifen-inducible conditional BACE1 knockout mice in which the Bace1 gene may be deleted in the whole body of the adult at will. Importantly, the adult conditional BACE1 knockout mice largely lack phenotypes, indicating that many BACE1 functions are not required in the adult organism. However, a germline phenotype was observed after BACE1 knockout in the adult: reduced length and disorganization of the hippocampal mossy fiber infrapyramidal bundle comprised of axons of dentate gyrus granule cells. The infrapyramidal bundle abnormality correlated with reduced proteolytic processing of the neural cell adhesion protein CHL1 that is involved in axonal guidance. We conclude that BACE1 inhibition in the adult mouse brain does not lead to the phenotypes associated with BACE1 deficiency during embryonic and postnatal development. However, adult conditional BACE1 knockout mice also suggest that BACE1 inhibitor drugs may disrupt the organization of an axonal pathway in the hippocampus, an important structure for learning and memory. Here, I review the adult conditional BACE1 knockout results and consider their implications for BACE1 inhibitor clinical trials.","2426-0266","The journal of prevention of Alzheimer's disease","(6) 78-84",2019,"R","Vassar","R","R.

Strikingly, brain changes, tissue damage and neuropsychological symptoms due to Meth exposure compels and necessitates to link the probability of risk of developing premature Alzheimer's disease, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by amyloid plaques composed of amyloid-β peptides and clinical dementia. These peptides are derived from sequential cleavages of the β-amyloid precursor protein by β- and γ-secretases. Previous studies reveals evidence for both positive and negative effects of Meth pertaining to cognitive functioning based on the dosage paradigm and duration of exposure revealing a beneficial psychotropic profile under some conditions and deleterious cognitive deficits under some others. In this context, we proposed to examine the effect of Meth on βAPP metabolism and βAPP-cleaving secretases in the human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cell line. Our results showed that Meth dose-dependently increases BACE1 expression and catalytic activity, while its effect on the α-cleavage of βAPP and on the expression and catalytic activity of the main α-secretase ADAM10 display a bell-curve shape. To our knowledge, the present study is the first to demonstrate that Meth can control βAPP-cleaving secretases.

Yet the underlying molecular mechanisms regulating their convergence remain unclear. Here, we show that the polarity protein partitioning-defective 3 (Par3) regulates the polarized convergence between APP and BACE1 in hippocampal neurons. Par3 forms a complex with BACE1 through its first PDZ domain, which is important for regulating BACE1 endosome-to-TGN trafficking. In the absence of Par3, there is an increase in the convergence between internalized APP and BACE1. In hippocampal neurons, loss of Par3 leads to increased APP and BACE1 convergence in axons but not in dendrites. This polarized convergence mainly occurs in retrograde or stalled axonal late endocytic organelles and is likely due to compartment-specific regulation of APP trafficking by Par3. Together, our data show a novel function for Par3 in regulating polarized convergence between APP and BACE1 in hippocampal neurons.","1558-1497","Neurobiology of aging","(77) 87-93",2019,"Miao","Sun","M","Department of Neuroscience and Cell Biology, Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Piscataway, NJ, USA.

Although the mechanism of pathogen-induced neurodegeneration of AD remains unclear, astrocytes, a key player of the CNS innate immune response and producer/metabolizer of β-amyloid, have been implicated. We hypothesized that Chlamydia pneumoniae infection of human astrocytes alters the expression of the amyloid precursor protein (APP)-processing secretases, ADAM10, BACE1, and PSEN1, to promote β-amyloid formation. Utilizing immunofluorescent microscopy, molecular, and biochemical approaches, these studies explore the role of an intracellular respiratory pathogen, Chlamydia pneumoniae, as an environmental trigger for AD pathology.

Amyloid plaques consist of fibrils of full length Aβ peptides as well as N-terminally truncated species. β-Site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme (BACE1) cleaves amyloid precursor protein in the first step in Aβ peptide production and is an attractive therapeutic target to limit Aβ generation. Inhibition of BACE1, however, induces a unique pattern of Aβ peptides with increased levels of N-terminally truncated Aβ peptides starting at position 5 (Aβ5-X), indicating that these peptides are generated through a BACE1-independent pathway. Here we elucidate the aggregation mechanism of Aβ5-42 and its influence on full-length Aβ42. We find that, compared to Aβ42, Aβ5-42 is more aggregation prone and displays enhanced nucleation rates. Aβ5-42 oligomers cause nonspecific membrane disruption to similar extent as Aβ42 but appear at earlier time points in the aggregation reaction. Noteworthy, this implies similar toxicity of Aβ42 and Aβ5-42 and the toxic species are generated faster by Aβ5-42. The increased rate of secondary nucleation on the surface of existing fibrils originates from a higher affinity of Aβ5-42 monomers for fibrils, as compared to Aβ42: an effect that may be related to the reduced net charge of Aβ5-42. Moreover, Aβ5-42 and Aβ42 peptides coaggregate into heteromolecular fibrils and either species can elongate existing Aβ42 or Aβ5-42 fibrils but Aβ42 fibrils are more catalytic than Aβ5-42 fibrils. Our findings highlight the importance of the N-terminus for surface-catalyzed nucleation and thus the production of toxic oligomers.","1948-7193","ACS chemical neuroscience","(10) 2374-2384",2019,"Tanja","Weiffert","T","Department of Biochemistry and Structural Biology , Lund University , P O box 124, 221 00 Lund , Sweden."

Aβ oligomers can trigger tau phosphorylation and neuronal alterations through activation of neuronal kinases leading to progressive cognitive decline. PKR is a ubiquitous pro-apoptotic serine/threonine kinase, and levels of activated PKR are increased in AD brains and AD CSF. In addition, PKR regulates negatively memory formation in mice. To assess the role of PKR in an AD in vivo model, we crossed 5xFAD transgenic mice with PKR knockout (PKRKO) mice and we explored the contribution of PKR on cognition and brain lesions in the 5xFAD mouse model of AD as well as in neuron-microglia co-cultures exposed to the innate immunity activator lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Nine-month-old double-mutant mice revealed significantly improved memory consolidation with the new object location test, starmaze test, and elevated plus maze test as compared to 5xFAD mice. Brain amyloid accumulation and BACE1 levels were statistically decreased in double-mutant mice. Apoptosis, neurodegeneration markers, and synaptic alterations were significantly reduced in double-mutant mice as well as neuroinflammation markers such as microglial load and brain cytokine levels. Using cocultures, we found that PKR in neurons was essential for LPS microglia-induced neuronal death. Our results demonstrate the clear involvement of PKR in abnormal spatial memory and brain lesions in the 5xFAD model and underline its interest as a target for neuroprotection in AD.","1474-9726","Aging cell","(18) e12887",2019,"Marion","Tible","M","Inserm U1144, Paris, France."

30830576,"A Close Look at BACE1 Inhibitors for Alzheimer's Disease Treatment.","Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of age-dependent dementia, is one of the most significant healthcare problems worldwide. Aggravating this situation, drugs that are currently US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for AD treatment do not prevent or delay disease progression. Therefore, developing effective therapies for AD patients is of critical urgency. Human genetic and clinical studies over the past three decades have indicated that abnormal generation or accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides is a likely culprit in AD pathogenesis. Aβ is generated from amyloid precursor protein (APP) via proteolytic cleavage by β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) (memapsin 2, β-secretase, Asp 2 protease) and γ-secretase. Mice deficient in BACE1 show abrogated production of Aβ. Therefore, pharmacological inhibition of BACE1 is being intensively pursued as a therapeutic approach to treat AD patients. Recent setbacks in clinical trials with BACE1 inhibitors have highlighted the critical importance of understanding how to properly inhibit BACE1 to treat AD patients. This review summarizes the recent studies on the role of BACE1 in synaptic functions as well as our views on BACE1 inhibition as an effective AD treatment.","1179-1934","CNS drugs","(33) 251-263",2019,"Brati","Das","B","Department of Neuroscience, Room E4032, UConn Health, 263 Farmington Avenue, Farmington, CT, 06030-3401, USA."

Using a designed bi-functional fusion protein TARBP-BTP in a complex with siRNA, we earlier demonstrated knockdown of target genes in the brain of both AβPP-PS1 (Alzheimer's disease, AD) and wild-type C57BL/6 mice. In this report, we further substantiate the approach through an extended use in AβPP-PS1 mice, which upon treatment with seven doses of β-secretase AβPP cleaving Enzyme 1 (BACE1) TARBP-BTP:siRNA, led to target-specific effect in the mouse brain. Concomitant gene silencing of BACE1, and consequent reduction in plaque load in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus (greater than 60%) in mice treated with TARBP-BTP:siRNA complex, led to improvement in spatial learning and memory.

Mutations in L1cam, a member of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily that mediate cell-cell contacts through homo- and heterophilic interactions, are associated with several developmental abnormalities of the nervous system, including mental retardation, limb spasticity, hydrocephalus, and corpus callosum aplasia. L1cam has been reported to be shed from the cell surface, but the significance of this during different phases of brain development is unknown. We here show that ADAM10-mediated shedding of L1cam is regulated by its fibronectin type III (FNIII) domains. Specifically, the third FNIII domain is important for maintaining a conformation where access to a membrane proximal cleavage site is restricted. To define the role of ADAM10/17/BACE1-mediated shedding of L1cam during brain development, we used a zebrafish model system. Knockdown of the zebrafish, l1camb, caused hydrocephalus, defects in axonal outgrowth, and myelination abnormalities. Rescue experiments with proteinase-resistant and soluble L1cam variants showed that proteolytic cleavage is not required for normal axonal outgrowth and development of the ventricular system. In contrast, metalloproteinase-mediated shedding is required for efficient myelination, and only specific fragments are able to mediate this stimulatory function of the shedded L1cam.","2045-2322","Scientific reports","(9) 3716",2019,"Cecilie","Linneberg","C","Department of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Aarhus University, Gustav Wieds Vej 10C, 8000, Aarhus C, Denmark."

Besides the multi-factorial nature of the disease, the diversity in the size and shape of known ligands that bind to the active site of BACE1, that is the flexibility of the enzyme, pose a serious challenge for the identification of drug candidates. To address the issue of receptor flexibility we have carried out ensemble docking with multiple receptor conformations. Therein, two representative structures each from closed and semi-open BACE1 conformations were selected for virtual screening to identify compounds that bind to the active site of both the conformations. These outperformed compounds were ranked using pharmacophore models generated by a ligand-based approach, for the identification of BACE1 inhibitors. The inhibitors were further predicted for anti-amyloidogenic activity using a QSAR model already established by our group thus enlisting compounds with dual potency. BACE1 inhibitory and anti-amyloidogenic activity for the commercially available compounds were validated using in vitro studies. Thus, incorporation of receptor flexibility in BACE1 through ensemble docking in conjunction with structure and ligand-based approach for screening might act as an effective protocol for obtaining promising scaffolds against AD.","2045-2322","Scientific reports","(9) 3714",2019,"Sucharita","Das","S","Department of Microbiology, University of Calcutta, 35 Ballygunge Circular Road, Kolkata, 700 019, India."

Previous evidence suggested that exercise exerts neuroprotective effects in a variety of AD models. In the present study, we investigated the effects of a 12-week treadmill exercise program on Aβ deposits in amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin 1 (PS1) transgenic mice and the potential underlying mechanism. After 12 weeks of exercise, Aβ deposits were significantly decreased in the hippocampus. Meanwhile, the amyloidogenic pathway of APP metabolism was inhibited, which was associated with a decrease in BACE1 expression. The APP metabolism mediated by the nonamyloidogenic pathway, as indicated by the increase in ADAM10 levels. Coincidentally, exercise reduced the cholesterol level, as evidenced by a significant decrease in the total cholesterol level and the activity of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase, as well as a reduction in the number of lipid rafts, as evidenced by a significant decrease in the flotillin 1 level. These finding suggested that the 12-week treadmill exercise program reduced Aβ deposition in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice, possibly by regulating ADAM10 and BACE1 levels and by decreasing cholesterol-mediated lipid raft formation, indicating that exercise represents a therapeutic intervention to treat AD.","1473-558X","Neuroreport","(30) 498-503",2019,"Xian-Liang","Zhang","XL","Shandong University, Jinan."

The current study aimed to investigate the effects of treadmill exercise on UPR signaling and the Aβ production and to demonstrate whether exercise-induced Aβ reduction was associated with changes in UPR signaling. Three-month old male APP/PS1 transgenic and wild-type mice were subjected to treadmill exercise for 3 months. At the end of exercise (6 months old), the levels of Aβ plaques and soluble forms of Aβ, and proteins involve in the unfolded protein response (UPR) were analyzed in the hippocampus. Three months of treadmill exercise resulted in a robust reduction in Aβ plaques and soluble forms of Aβ in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. This was accompanied by a significant decrease in β-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and presenilin-1 (PS1) expression. Meanwhile, we found that treadmill exercise down-regulated the expression of GRP78 and inhibited activation of PERK, eIF2α, and ATF4, reflecting the involvement of the UPR signaling.

With the exception of rare mutations in APP, PSEN1, and PSEN2 genes causing autosomal dominant EOAD, little is known about the genetic factors underlying most of the EOAD cases. In this study, we hypothesized that copy number variations (CNVs) in microRNA (miR) genes could contribute to risk for EOAD. miRs are short non-coding RNAs previously implicated in the regulation of AD-related genes and phenotypes. Using whole exome sequencing, we screened a series of 546 EOAD patients negative for autosomal dominant EOAD mutations and 597 controls. We identified 86 CNVs in miR genes of which 31 were exclusive to EOAD cases, including a duplication of the MIR138-2 locus. In functional studies in human cultured cells, we could demonstrate that miR-138 overexpression leads to higher Aβ production as well as tau phosphorylation, both implicated in AD pathophysiology. These changes were mediated in part by GSK-3β and FERMT2, a potential risk factor for AD. Additional disease-related genes were also prone to miR-138 regulation including APP and BACE1. This study suggests that increased gene dosage of MIR138-2 could contribute to risk for EOAD by regulating different biological pathways implicated in amyloid and tau metabolism. Additional studies are now required to better understand the role of miR-CNVs in EOAD.","1875-8908","Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD","(68) 1243-1255",2019,"Emmanuelle","Boscher","E","Centre de recherche du CHU de Québec-Université Laval, CHUL, Axe Neurosciences, Québec, Canada."

Despite more than a century of research, there are still no early biomarkers for AD. It has been reported that AD affects the eye, which is more accessible for imaging than the brain; however, links with the cornea have not been evaluated. To investigate whether the cornea could be used to identify possible diagnostic indicators of AD, we analyzed the proteolytic processing and isoforms of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and evaluated the expression of AD-related genes and proteins in corneal fibroblasts from wild-type (WT) corneas and corneas from patients with granular corneal dystrophy type 2 (GCD2), which is related to amyloid formation in the cornea. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis was used to assess the expression of AD-related genes, i.e., APP, ADAM10, BACE1, BACE2, PSEN1, NCSTN, IDE, and NEP. RT-PCR and DNA sequencing analysis demonstrated that isoforms of APP770 and APP751, but not APP695, were expressed in corneal fibroblasts. Moreover, the mRNA ratio of APP770/APP751 isoforms was approximately 4:1. Western blot analysis also demonstrated the expression of a disintegrin and metalloprotease domain-containing protein 10 (ADAM10), beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), nicastrin, insulin degradation enzyme, and neprilysin in corneal fibroblasts. Among these targets, the levels of immature ADAM10 and BACE1 protein were significantly increased in GCD2 cells. The expression levels of APP, ADAM10, BACE1, and transforming growth factor-beta-induced protein (TGFBIp) were also detected by western blot in human corneal epithelium. We also investigated the effects of inhibition of the autophagy-lysosomal and ubiquitin-proteasomal proteolytic systems (UPS) on APP processing and metabolism. These pathway inhibitors accumulated APP, α-carboxy-terminal fragments (CTFs), β-CTFs, and the C-terminal APP intracellular domain (AICD) in corneal fibroblasts. Analysis of microRNAs (miRNAs) revealed that miR-9 and miR-181a negatively coregulated BACE1 and TGFBIp, which was directly associated with the pathogenesis of AD and GCD2, respectively. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated that APP and BACE1 were distributed in corneal stroma cells, epithelial cells, and the retinal layer in mice. Collectively, we propose that the cornea, which is the transparent outermost layer of the eye and thus offers easy accessibility, could be used as a potential biomarker for AD diagnosis and progression.","1096-0007","Experimental eye research","(182) 167-174",2019,"Seung-Il","Choi","SI","Department of Ophthalmology, Corneal Dystrophy Research Institute, Yonsei University College of Medicine, Seoul, South Korea."

The collection of Aβ in the brain is an early poisonous occasion in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease, which is the most widely recognized type of dementia correlated with plaques and tangles within the brain. However, the mechanism of the intraneuronal direction of BACE1 is poorly understood. AD is caused by mutations in one of the genes that encoding APP, presenilins 1 and 2. Most of the mutations in these genes increase Aβ42 production. Numerous receptors are associated with initiating Aβ transport and clearance. Among them, RAGE is an influx transport receptor that binds soluble Aβ and mediates pathophysiological cellular responses. RAGE additionally intervenes the vehicle of plasma Aβ over the blood-brain barrier. LRP-1 functions as a clearance receptor for Aβ at the blood-brain barrier.

However, it remains unclear whether these two types of noncoding RNAs functionally interact and which factors mediate these interactions in AD. β-secretase 1 (BACE1) is the enzyme responsible for amyloid plaque formation, which is a central pathological feature of AD. The lncRNA BACE1-AS and some miRNAs have been implicated in the regulation of BACE1. In this study, we reveal that BACE1-AS shares many miRNA-response elements with BACE1. The overexpression of BACE1-AS results in the repression of miRNAs that target BACE1, thus preventing BACE1 mRNA from being degraded. The knockdown of BACE1-AS increases the levels of these miRNAs, thereby reducing the expression of BACE1. Thus, BACE1-AS functions as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA). Our results also deepen the understanding of the regulation of BACE1 by BACE1-AS. In addition to increasing the stability of BACE1 mRNA through the formation of RNA duplexes, BACE1-AS can regulate BACE1 indirectly by acting as a ceRNA. Therefore, we propose that BACE1 functions as a ceRNA and forms a network through its associations with protein-coding genes, lncRNAs and miRNAs in the pathophysiology of AD.","1873-6300","Journal of chemical neuroanatomy","(98) 87-96",2019,"Tao","Zeng","T","Research Center of Developmental Biology, Second Military Medical University, Shanghai, 200433, China."

Beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is indispensable for Aβ production, and knockout of BACE1 has no overt phenotypes in mouse. Thus, fine modulation of BACE1 may be a safe and effective treatment for AD patients. However, the large active site of BACE1 makes it challenging to target BACE1 with classical small-molecule inhibitors. DNA aptamer can have high affinity and specificity against diverse targets, and it provides an alternative strategy to target BACE1. In this study, we used a novel cell-systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) strategy to select specific DNA aptamers optimized to target BACE1 under physiological status. After 17 rounds of selection, we identified two DNA aptamers against BACE1: BI1 and BI2. The identified aptamers interacted with BACE1 in pull-down assay, inhibited BACE1 activity in in vitro fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay and HEK293-APP stable cell line, reduced Aβ in the culture medium of HEK293-amyloid protein precursor (APP) stable cell line and APP-PS1 primary cultured neurons, and rescued Aβ-induced neuronal deficiency in APP-PS1 primary cultured neurons. In contrast, the identified aptamers had no effect on α- or γ-secretase. In addition, cholesteryl tetraetylene glycol (TEG) modification further improved the potency of the identified aptamers. Our study suggests that it is feasible and effective to target BACE1 with DNA aptamers, and the therapeutic potential of the identified aptamers deserves further investigation.","2162-2531","Molecular therapy.

Aberrant miRNA regulation has been associated with neurodegeneration, including alterations of specific miRNAs in brain tissue, serum, and cerebrospinal fluid from MSA patients. Still, a causal link between deregulation of miRNA networks and pathological changes in the transcriptome remains elusive. We profiled ~ 800 miRNAs in the striatum of MSA patients in comparison to healthy individuals to identify specific miRNAs altered in MSA. In addition, we performed a parallel screening of 700 transcripts associated with neurodegeneration to determine the impact of miRNA deregulation on the transcriptome. We identified 60 miRNAs with abnormal levels in MSA brains that are involved in extracellular matrix receptor interactions, prion disease, inflammation, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, and addiction pathways. Using the correlation between miRNA expression and the abundance of their known targets, miR-124-3p, miR-19a-3p, miR-27b-3p, and miR-29c-3p were identified as key regulators altered in MSA, mainly contributing to neuroinflammation. Finally, our study also uncovered a potential link between Alzheimer's disease (AD) and MSA pathologies that involves miRNAs and deregulation of BACE1. Our results provide a comprehensive appraisal of miRNA alterations in MSA and their effect on the striatal transcriptome, supporting that aberrant miRNA expression is highly correlated with changes in gene transcription associated with MSA neuropathology, in particular those driving inflammation, disrupting myelination, and potentially impacting α-synuclein accumulation via deregulation of autophagy and prion mechanisms.","1559-1182","Molecular neurobiology","(56) 7003-7021",2019,"Taeyeon","Kim","T","Department of Neuroscience, University of California San Diego, 9500 Gilman Dr., MTF 344 MC0624, La Jolla, CA, 92093-0624, USA."

31039426,"Protective effect of Tenuifolin against Alzheimer's disease.","Amyloid-β (Aβ) plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD), an age-related neurodegenerative ailment. Emerging evidence suggests that Tenuifolin (TEN) significantly decreases Aβ secretion and relieves cellular inflammatory responses. However, the mechanism of this activity has not been fully elucidated. In the present study, we investigate the effect of TEN on autophagy, a process that plays an important role in the generation and metabolism of Aβ, in the presence or absence of the autophagy inhibitor 3-MA. The obtained results show that TEN prevents Aβ25-35-induced inflammation and decreases Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 levels by decreasing BACE1 in SH-SY5Y cells. Moreover, TEN decreases the mRNA levels of BACE1 but has no impact on the gene expressions of amyloid precursor proteins (APP). 3-MA, the most widely used autophagy inhibitor, reverses the effects of TEN in Aβ25-35-induced SH-SY5Y cells. The association between TEN and autophagy was further investigated by examining the levels of autophagy markers LC3 II and Beclin 1, as well as the protein levels of mTOR, AMPK, and ULK1. The results showed that TEN increases LC3 II, Beclin 1, and mTOR, inhibits the degradation of AMPK, and increases the expression of ULK1. This suggests that TEN protects against Aβ25-35-induced cellular inflammation in an AD cell model through the regulation of autophagy, which, in part, is mediated by the activation of the AMPK/mTOR/ULK1 pathway.","1872-7972","Neuroscience letters","(705) 195-201",2019,"Lin","Wang","L","Institute of Medical Sciences, Guangdong Pharmaceutical University, Guangdong, 510006, China."

Here, we report that lysosomal dysfunction in Down ayndrome (trisomy 21), a neurodevelopmental disorder and form of early onset AD, requires the extra gene copy of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and is specifically mediated by the β cleaved carboxy terminal fragment of APP (APP-βCTF, C99). In primary fibroblasts from individuals with DS, lysosomal degradation of autophagic and endocytic substrates is selectively impaired, causing them to accumulate in enlarged autolysosomes/lysosomes. Direct measurements of lysosomal pH uncovered a significant elevation (0.6 units) as a basis for slowed LC3 turnover and the inactivation of cathepsin D and other lysosomal hydrolases known to be unstable or less active when lysosomal pH is persistently elevated. Normalizing lysosome pH by delivering acidic nanoparticles to lysosomes ameliorated lysosomal deficits, whereas RNA sequencing analysis excluded a transcriptional contribution to hydrolase declines. Cortical neurons cultured from the Ts2 mouse model of DS exhibited lysosomal deficits similar to those in DS cells.

Since the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is involved in these processes, we investigated effects of the retinoid X receptor agonist, bexarotene (Bex), and the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α agonist and antioxidant, astaxanthin (Asx), on pathways of cellular cholesterol metabolism, amyloid precursor protein processing/Aβ production and transfer at the BBB in vitro using primary porcine brain capillary endothelial cells (pBCEC), and in 3xTg AD mice. Asx/Bex downregulated transcription/activity of amyloidogenic BACE1 and reduced Aβ oligomers and ~80 kDa intracellular 6E10-reactive APP/Aβ species, while upregulating non-amyloidogenic ADAM10 and soluble (s)APPα production in pBCEC. Asx/Bex enhanced Aβ clearance to the apical/plasma compartment of the in vitro BBB model. Asx/Bex increased expression levels of ABCA1, LRP1, and/or APOA-I. Asx/Bex promoted cholesterol efflux, partly via PPARα/RXR activation, while cholesterol biosynthesis/esterification was suppressed. Silencing of LRP-1 or inhibition of ABCA1 by probucol reversed Asx/Bex-mediated effects on levels of APP/Aβ species in pBCEC. Murine (m)BCEC isolated from 3xTg AD mice treated with Bex revealed elevated expression of APOE and ABCA1. Asx/Bex reduced BACE1 and increased LRP-1 expression in mBCEC from 3xTg AD mice when compared to vehicle-treated or non-Tg treated mice. In parallel, Asx/Bex reduced levels of Aβ oligomers in mBCEC and Aβ species in brain soluble and insoluble fractions of 3xTg AD mice. Our results suggest that both agonists exert beneficial effects at the BBB by balancing cholesterol homeostasis and enhancing clearance of Aβ from cerebrovascular endothelial cells.","1879-260X","Biochimica et biophysica acta.

In the present study, we primarily targeted the inhibition of Beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE1) by a naturally occurring cyanobacterial protein phycoerythrin (C-PE). BACE1 cleaves amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) and leads to accumulation of neurotoxic amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques in the brain, as an attribute of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Inhibition of BACE1 was measured in terms of their association and dissociation rate constants, thermodynamics of binding using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The kinetic parameters for enzyme activity were also measured using synthetic decapeptide as a substrate.

However, the mechanisms that regulate BACE1 expression are unclear. Here, we show that peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor delta (PPARδ) decreases BACE1 expression by up-regulating suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. The activation of PPARδ by GW501516, a specific PPARδ agonist, inhibited expression of BACE1. This effect was abrogated by shRNA-mediated knockdown of PPARδ and by treatment with the PPARδ antagonist GSK0660, indicating that PPARδ is involved in GW501516-mediated suppression of BACE1 expression. On the other hand, GW501516-activated PPARδ induced expression of SOCS1, which is a negative regulator of cytokine signal transduction, at the transcriptional level by binding to a PPAR response element in its promoter. This GW501516-mediated induction of SOCS1 expression led to down-regulation of BACE1 expression via inactivation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1. GW501516-activated PPARδ suppressed the generation of neurotoxic amyloid beta (Aβ) in accordance with the decrease in BACE1 expression. Taken together, these results indicate that PPARδ attenuates BACE1 expression via SOCS1-mediated inhibition of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 signaling, thereby suppressing BACE1-associated generation of neurotoxic Aβ.","1471-4159","Journal of neurochemistry","(151) 370-385",2019,"Won Jin","Lee","WJ","College of Sang-Huh Life Sciences, Konkuk University, Seoul, Korea."

The results were replicated in a second cohort comprising 14 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 9 controls. The levels of tau and APP were reduced in microvesicles of Alzheimer's disease patients. A significant change was neither observed in the number of microvesicles nor in the expression of the other antigens.

The antioxidant activity suggests that MSRB2 may play a role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we report that in APP/PS1 mice, an animal model of AD, MSRB2 protein levels were decreased in the hippocampus at both young (6 mon) and old (18 mon) age, and in the cortex only at an old age, respectively. In HEK293 cells that stably express human full-length β-amyloid precursor protein (APP, HEK/APP), MSRB2 reduced the protein and mRNA levels of APP and β-amyloid converting enzyme 1 (BACE1), and the consequent amyloid beta peptide (Aβ) 1-40 and Aβ1-42 levels. MSRB2 overexpression or knockdown also oppositely affected Tau phosphorylation at selective sites, with the concomitant alteration of the phosphorylated extracellular signal regulated kinase (p-ERK) and AMP-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK) levels. Moreover, in cells treated with long-term (24 h) hydrogen peroxide, the alterations of APP processing and Tau phosphorylation were reversed by MSRB2 overexpression. We further found that MSRB2-mediated regulation of APP transcription involved JNK and ERK signaling, as MSRB2 also reduced the levels of phosphorylated JNK (p-JNK), and JNK or ERK inhibitor attenuated the effect of MSRB2 on APP proteins and transcripts. Finally, MSRB2 reduced apoptosis-related proteins Bax and caspase3 and enhanced the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl2. These results indicated that the role for MSRB2 in AD-like pathology was closely associated with its antioxidant activity. By attenuating both amyloidogenesis and Tau phosphorylation, MSRB2 may serve as a potential therapeutic target for AD.","1090-2430","Experimental neurology","(318) 145-156",2019,"Xiao-Jiao","Xiang","XJ","Department of Neurology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing Key Laboratory of Neurology, 1 Youyi Road, Chongqing 400016, China."

Hence, we here aimed to assess if targeted anti-diabetic therapies (Liraglutide and Fenretinide) would attenuate the diabetic and behavioural phenotype of these mice. PLB4 mice and wild-type (WT) controls were administered Liraglutide or Fenretinide for ten consecutive weeks alongside vehicle-treated mice. Physiological (body weight and mass composition, glucose tolerance, serum hormone concentration), behavioural (locomotor activity) and molecular assessments were performed in mice pre- and post-treatment. Liraglutide and Fenretinide treatments inhibited adiposity gain and decreased circulating serum triglyceride (with Liraglutide) and leptin (with Fenretinide) levels in PLB4 mice. We also found that PLB4 mice exhibited increased levels of serum dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), together with up-regulated hepatic expression of Dpp4, retinol binding protein 4 (Rbp4) and sterol regulatory element-binding 1c (Srebp1c), which was normalised by both treatments. Interestingly, Liraglutide treatment slowed down habituation to a novel environment and increased secondary night activity peak in WT mice, suggesting an impact on circadian activity regulation. However, neither treatment improved glucose homeostasis in PLB4 mice, implying that impaired glucose metabolism in this genotype may not be associated with glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and/or RBP4-mediated pathways.

It is thus of considerable interest to investigate how BACE1 activity is regulated. BACE1 has its maximal activity at acidic pH and GFP variant-pHluorin-displays pH dependence. In light of these observations, we generated three tandem fluorescence-tagged BACE1 fusion proteins, named pHluorin-BACE1-mCherry, BACE1-mCherry-pHluorin and BACE1-mCherry-EGFP. Comparing the fluorescence characteristics of these proteins in response to intracellular pH changes induced by chloroquine or bafilomycin A1, we found that pHluorin-BACE1-mCherry is a better pH sensor for BACE1 because its fluorescence intensity responds to pH changes more dramatically and more quickly. Additionally, we found that (pro)renin receptor (PRR), a subunit of the v-ATPase complex, which is critical for maintaining vesicular pH, regulates pHluorin's fluorescence and BACE1 activity in pHluorin-BACE1-mCherry expressing cells. Finally, we found that the expression of Swedish mutant APP (APPswe) suppresses pHluorin fluorescence in pHluorin-BACE1-mCherry expressing cells in culture and in vivo, implicating APPswe not only as a substrate but also as an activator of BACE1. Taken together, these results suggest that the pHluorin-BACE1-mCherry fusion protein may serve as a useful tool for visualizing active/inactive BACE1 in culture and in vivo.","2073-4409","Cells","E474",2019,"Lu","Zhao","L","Key Laboratory of Molecular Epigenetics of Ministry of Education, Institute of Cytology and Genetics, Northeast Normal University, Changchun 130024, China. zhaol014@nenu.edu.cn."

Henceforth, this study aimed to investigate the potential neuroprotective effect of vinpocetine in aluminum-induced AD model associated with social isolation. Social isolation increased the escape latency in Morris water maze (MWM) test, elevated the immobility score and decreased swimming score in forced swimming test (FST) in aluminum treated rats. However, vinpocetine enhanced acquisition in MWM test and exerted anti-depressive effect in FST.

The present study investigated the damaging effect of KA on neurons by focusing on the inflammasome-mediated signaling pathways. Assessments using cultured microglia and mouse brains demonstrated that KA treatment specifically induced inflammasome activation. Mechanistic evaluations showed that KA activated two major components of inflammasomes, nucleotide binding oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor (NLR) protein 3 (NLRP3) and nuclear factor (NF)-κB, which resulted in the production of interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Inhibition of NLRP3 or NF-κB by Bay11-7082 caused a reduction in the KA-induced expression of interleukin (IL)-1β and BDNF. Moreover, knockdown of the expression of KA receptors (KARs) such as Grik1 and Grik3 induced suppression of NLRP3 and NF-κB, suggesting that KARs function upstream of NLRP3 and NF-κB to mediate the effects of KA on regulation of IL-1β and BDNF expression.

For building this model, a database with 215 molecules collected from different sources has been assembled. This dataset contains diverse compounds with different scaffolds and physical-chemical properties, covering a wide chemical space in the drug-like range. The most distinctive aspect of the applied QSAR strategy is the combination of hybridization with backward elimination of models, which contributes to improve the quality of the final QSAR model. Another relevant step is the visual analysis of the molecular descriptors that allows guaranteeing the absence of information redundancy in the model. The QSAR model performances have been assessed by traditional metrics, and the final proposed model has low cardinality, and reaches a high percentage of chemical compounds correctly classified.","2045-2322","Scientific reports","(9) 9102",2019,"Ignacio","Ponzoni","I","Instituto de Ciencias e Ingeniería de la Computación (UNS-CONICET), Bahía Blanca, Argentina. ip@cs.uns.edu.ar."

Therefore, individual human identity depends fully on a proper access to the autobiographical memory. Such access is hindered under pathological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, which affects millions of people worldwide. Unfortunately, no effective cure exists to prevent this disorder, the impact of which will rise alarmingly within the next decades. While Alzheimer's disease is largely considered to be the outcome of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide accumulation in the brain, conceiving this complex disorder strictly as the result of Aβ-neurotoxicity is perhaps a too straight-line simplification. Instead, complementary to this view, the tableau of molecular disarrangements in the Alzheimer's disease brain may be reflecting, at least in part, a loss of function phenotype in memory processing. Here we take BACE1 translation and degradation as a gateway to study molecular mechanisms putatively involved in the transition between memory and neurodegeneration. BACE1 participates in the excision of Aβ-peptide from its precursor holoprotein, but plays a role in synaptic plasticity too.

BACE1-AS lncRNA upregulates in the brain of people with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and might be detected in the bloodstream. To reveal if lncRNA BACE1-AS may serve as a blood-based biomarker for AD, we compared its levels in plasma and plasma-derived exosomes between AD (n = 45) and healthy people (n = 36). Exosomes were purified from plasma by Invitrogen™ Total Exosome Isolation Kit and characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and dynamic light scattering (DLS). Total RNA was extracted from whole plasma, and plasma-derived exosomes using TRIzol® LS or TRIzol® Reagents respectively were then reverse transcribed to the cDNA using PrimeScript II cDNA synthesis kit. The BACE1-AS levels were quantified by real-time PCR, and their biomarker potencies were evaluated using ROC curve analysis. Results obtained verified the presence of BACE1-AS in the plasma samples of both AD and healthy controls. We did not observe any significant differences between the levels of BACE1-AS in the plasma or plasma-derived exosomes of AD and control people. However, there were significant differences between AD subgroups and control in the whole plasma samples. The BACE1-AS level was low in pre-AD subgroup but it was high in full-AD people compared to the healthy controls. Moreover, ROC curve analysis revealed that lncRNA BACE1-AS may discriminate pre-AD and healthy control (75% sensitivity and 100% specificity), full-AD and healthy control (68% sensitivity and 100% specificity), and pre-AD and full-AD subgroups (78% sensitivity and 100% specificity), highlighting its potential as a biomarker for AD development. In conclusion, plasma BACE1-AS level may serve as a potent blood-based biomarker for Alzheimer's disease.","1559-1166","Journal of molecular neuroscience : MN","(69) 351-359",2019,"Seyedeh Nahid","Fotuhi","SN","Department of Animal Biology, Faculty of Natural Science, University of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran."

NF-κβ is a target for new therapeutics because it plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer disease (AD). In contrast, ambrsoin, a sesquiterpene lactone which is a potent NF-κβ inhibitor, is scarcely studied in AD models. The current work aims to assess the efficacy of ambrosin as a possible remedy for AD. In silico studies showed that bioavailability and BBB permeability could be favorable for ambrosin over curcumin. Memory impairment was induced in mice by single intraperitoneal injection of LPS (0.4 mg/kg). Treated groups received curcumin (100 mg/kg) or ambrosin at doses (5 or 10 mg/kg) for 7 days. Mice in treated groups showed a significant improvement in memory functions during Morris water maze and object recognition tests. Curcumin and ambrosin (10 mg/kg) inhibited the upsurge of NF-κβp65 transcript and protein levels. Consequently, downstream pro-inflammatory and nitrosative mediators were inhibited, namely, TNF-α, IL-1β, COX-2 and iNOS. BACE1 was inhibited, thereby reducing amyloid plaques (Aβ) deposition and eventually reducing inflammation and apoptosis of neurons as revealed by immunohistopathological examination. In conclusion, ambrosin can be repurposed as AD remedy after further pharmacokinetic/pharamacodynamic assessments. It could serve as an additional lead drug for AD therapeutics.","1932-6203","PloS one","(14) e0219378",2019,"Mohammed N A","Khalil","MNA","Pharmacognosy Department, Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo University, Cairo, Egypt."
31290061,"Characterization of Cerebrospinal Fluid BACE1 Species.","The β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is the main brain β-secretase responsible for the amyloidogenic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP). Previous studies have suggested that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) β-secretase activity may be a candidate diagnostic biomarker for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but biochemical characterization of BACE1 protein in CSF is needed. CSF samples from 19 AD patients and 19 age-matched non-AD controls (n = 19) were classified according to their Aβ42, total tau, and P-tau CSF biomarker levels. We found that β-secretase activity was higher in the CSF of AD subjects than in that of the controls. We found that the majority of the β-secretase activity in the CSF, measured using a peptide substrate homologous to the BACE1 cleavage site, was not inhibited by specific BACE1 inhibitors. We defined enzymatic activity attributable specifically to BACE1 as the activity that was blocked by the specific inhibitors, which is still higher in AD subjects. BACE1 protein levels were characterized by lectin binding, immunoprecipitation, blue native-PAGE, and western blotting using antibodies against specific protein domains. BACE1 was found to be present in human CSF as a mature form of ~ 70 kDa that probably comprised truncated and full-length species, and also as an immature form of ~ 50 kDa that retains the prodomain. CSF-BACE1 was found to assemble into hetero-complexes containing distinct species. Immunoblotting with an antibody against the C-terminus of BACE1 revealed significantly higher levels of the 70-kDa full-length BACE1, while the 50 kDa immature form remained unaltered. When the 70-kDa species was probed with an antibody against the N-terminus of BACE1 (which does not discriminate between truncated and full-length forms), no increase in immunoreactivity was observed, suggesting that truncated forms of BACE1 do not increase in AD. In conclusion, the complexity of BACE1 species in CSF has to be taken into consideration when determining BACE1 activity and protein levels in CSF as biomarkers of AD.","1559-1182","Molecular neurobiology","(56) 8603-8616",2019,"Inmaculada","Lopez-Font","I","Instituto de Neurociencias de Alicante, Universidad Miguel Hernández-CSIC, Av.

The flavonoids rich foods such as green tea, cocoa, blue berry and other foods improve the various states of cognitive dysfunction, AD and dementia-like pathological alterations in different animal models. The mechanisms of flavonoids have been shown to be mediated through the inhibition of cholinesterases including acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), β-secretase (BACE1), free radicals and modulation of signaling pathways, that are implicated in cognitive and neuroprotective functions. Flavonoids interact with various signaling protein pathways like ERK and PI3-kinase/Akt and modulate their actions, thereby leading to beneficial neuroprotective effects. Moreover, they enhance vascular blood flow and instigate neurogenesis particularly in the hippocampus. Flavonoids also hamper the progression of pathological symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases by inhibiting neuronal apoptosis induced by neurotoxic substances including free radicals and β-amyloid proteins (Aβ). All these protective mechanisms contribute to the maintenance of number, quality of neurons and their synaptic connectivity in the brain. Thus flavonoids can thwart the progression of age-related disorders and can be a potential source for the design and development of new drugs effective in cognitive disorders.","1663-4365","Frontiers in aging neuroscience","(11) 155",2019,"Muhammad","Ayaz","M","Department of Pharmacy, University of Malakand, Chakdara, Pakistan."

31347728,"BACE1 inhibitors: Current status and future directions in treating Alzheimer's disease.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an irreversible, progressive neurodegenerative brain disorder with no current cure. One of the important therapeutic approaches of AD is the inhibition of β-site APP cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE1), which is involved in the rate-limiting step of the cleavage process of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) leading to the generation of the neurotoxic amyloid β (Aβ) protein after the γ-secretase completes its function. The produced insoluble Aβ aggregates lead to plaques deposition and neurodegeneration. BACE1 is, therefore, one of the attractive targets for the treatment of AD. This approach led to the development of potent BACE1 inhibitors, many of which were advanced to late stages in clinical trials. Nonetheless, the high failure rate of lead drug candidates targeting BACE1 brought to the forefront the need for finding new targets to uncover the mystery behind AD. In this review, we aim to discuss the most promising classes of BACE1 inhibitors with a description and analysis of their pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic parameters, with more focus on the lead drug candidates that reached late stages of clinical trials, such as MK8931, AZD-3293, JNJ-54861911, E2609, and CNP520. In addition, the manuscript discusses the safety concerns and insignificant physiological effects, which were highlighted for the most successful BACE1 inhibitors. Furthermore, the review demonstrates with increasing evidence that despite tremendous efforts and promising results conceived with BACE1 inhibitors, the latest studies suggest that their clinical use for treating Alzheimer's disease should be reconsidered. Finally, the review sheds light on alternative therapeutic options for targeting AD.","1098-1128","Medicinal research reviews","(40) 339-384",2020,"Nour M","Moussa-Pacha","NM","Sharjah Institute for Medical Research, University of Sharjah, Sharjah, United Arab Emirates."

Besides, elevated glucocorticoid (GCs) levels cause metabolic stress and have been associated with the neurodegenerative process. Direct pieces of evidence link the reduction of GCs caused by the inhibition of 11β-HSD type 1 (11β-HSD1) with cognitive improvement. In the present study, we investigated the beneficial effects of 11β-HSD1 inhibitor (i) RL-118 after high-fat diet (HFD) treatment in the senescence-accelerated mouse prone 8 (SAMP8). We found an improvement in glucose intolerance induced by HFD in mice treated with RL-118, a significant reduction in 11β-HSD1 and glucocorticoid receptor (GR) protein levels. Furthermore, specific modifications in the FGF21 activation after treatment with 11β-HSD1i, RL-118, which induced changes in SIRT1/PGC1α/AMPKα pathway, were found. Oxidative stress (OS) and reactive oxygen species (ROS), as well as inflammatory markers and microglial activation, were significantly diminished in HFD mice treated with 11β-HSD1i. Remarkably, treatment with 11β-HSD1i altered PERK pathway in both diet groups, increasing autophagy only in HFD mice group. After RL-118 treatment, a decrease in glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3β) activation, Tau hyperphosphorylation, BACE1 protein levels and the product β-CTF were found. Increases in the non-amyloidogenic secretase ADAM10 protein levels and the product sAPPα were found in both treated mice, regardless of the diet.

31403945,"CDK5 Participates in Amyloid-β Production by Regulating PPARγ Phosphorylation in Primary Rat Hippocampal Neurons.","Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) in adipose tissue mediates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) phosphorylation at Ser273 to inhibit its activity, causing PPARγ target gene expression changes. Among these, insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) degrades amyloid-β peptide (Aβ), the core pathological product of Alzheimer's disease (AD), whereas β-amyloid cleavage enzyme 1 (BACE1) hydrolyzes amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP). Therefore, we speculated that CDK5 activity in the brain might participate in Aβ production, thereby functioning as a key molecule in AD pathogenesis. To confirm this hypothesis, we transduced primary rat hippocampal neurons using CDK5-expressing lentiviral vectors. CDK5 overexpression increased PPARγ Ser273 phosphorylation, decreased IDE expression, increased BACE1 and AβPP expression, increased Aβ levels, and induced neuronal apoptosis. The CDK5 inhibitor roscovitine effectively reversed these CDK5 overexpression-mediated effects. Moreover, silencing of the Cdk5 gene via CDK5 shRNA-expressing lentiviral vectors in primary hippocampal neurons did not exert any protective effect against normal neuronal apoptosis, nor were significant effects observed on Aβ levels, PPARγ phosphorylation, or PPARγ target gene expression in the cells. However, Cdk5 gene silencing exhibited a neuroprotective effect in the Aβ-induced AD neuron model by effectively inhibiting the Aβ-induced neuronal apoptosis, PPARγ phosphorylation, PPARγ expression downregulation, and PPARγ target gene expression changes, and reducing Aβ levels. In conclusion, this study demonstrated that CDK5 played an important role in the pathogenesis of AD. Specifically, CDK5 participated in Aβ production by regulating PPARγ phosphorylation. Targeted therapy against CDK5 could effectively reduce and reverse the neurotoxic effects of Aβ and may represent a novel approach for AD treatment.","1875-8908","Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD","(71) 443-460",2019,"Qiankun","Quan","Q","Department of Geriatrics, The Second Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China."

31422108,"Regulation of BACE1 expression after injury is linked to the p75 neurotrophin receptor.","BACE1 is a transmembrane aspartic protease that cleaves various substrates and it is required for normal brain function. BACE1 expression is high during early development, but it is reduced in adulthood. Under conditions of stress and injury, BACE1 levels are increased; however, the underlying mechanisms that drive BACE1 elevation are not well understood. One mechanism associated with brain injury is the activation of injurious p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75), which can trigger pathological signals. Here we report that within 72 h after controlled cortical impact (CCI) or laser injury, BACE1 and p75 are increased and tightly co-expressed in cortical neurons of mouse brain. Additionally, BACE1 is not up-regulated in p75 null mice in response to focal cortical injury, while p75 over-expression results in BACE1 augmentation in HEK-293 and SY5Y cell lines. A luciferase assay conducted in SY5Y cell line revealed that BACE1 expression is regulated at the transcriptional level in response to p75 transfection. Interestingly, this effect does not appear to be dependent upon p75 ligands including mature and pro-neurotrophins. In addition, BACE1 activity on amyloid precursor protein (APP) is enhanced in SY5Y-APP cells transfected with a p75 construct. Lastly, we found that the activation of c-jun n-terminal kinase (JNK) by p75 contributes to BACE1 up-regulation. This study explores how two injury-induced molecules are intimately connected and suggests a potential link between p75 signaling and the expression of BACE1 after brain injury.","1095-9327","Molecular and cellular neurosciences","(99) 103395",2019,"Khalil","Saadipour","K","Departments of Cell Biology, Physiology & Neuroscience, and Psychiatry, Skirball Institute of Biomolecular Medicine, New York University Langone Medical Center, New York, New York 10016, USA.

Two Phase I studies (NCT02509117, NCT02793232) investigated the safety/tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of PF-06751979. Single-ascending doses up to 540 mg and multiple-ascending doses up to 275 mg once daily (QD) in healthy adults, and multiple doses of 50 mg or 125 mg QD in healthy older subjects were assessed. PF-06751979 was well tolerated at all doses given, and all treatment-related adverse events (AEs) were mild to moderate. PK parameters remained consistent across the PF-06751979 QD dosing regimens, and no notable food effects were observed. PD analysis showed that PF-06751979 reduced the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma levels of Aβ peptides in a dose-dependent manner, with the greatest reductions observed in subjects treated with 275 mg QD (approximately 92% and 93% reduction in CSF Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 observed at 24 h after Day 14 dose, respectively). A drug interaction study (NCT03126721) using midazolam indicated that there was no clinically meaningful effect of multiple doses of PF-06751979 100 mg QD on the PK of single-dose midazolam in healthy adults.

While ATXN1 is associated with increased Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk, CAG repeat number in AD patients is not changed. Here, we investigated the consequences of ataxin-1 loss of function and discovered that knockout of Atxn1 reduced CIC-ETV4/5-mediated inhibition of Bace1 transcription, leading to increased BACE1 levels and enhanced amyloidogenic cleavage of APP, selectively in AD-vulnerable brain regions. Elevated BACE1 expression exacerbated Aβ deposition and gliosis in AD mouse models and impaired hippocampal neurogenesis and olfactory axonal targeting. In SCA1 mice, polyglutamine-expanded mutant ataxin-1 led to the increase of BACE1 post-transcriptionally, both in cerebrum and cerebellum, and caused axonal-targeting deficit and neurodegeneration in the hippocampal CA2 region.

Synaptic plasticity impairment is one of the early pathological events in AD. Transgenic APP/PS1 mice that overproduce Aβ are one of the most extensively used AD animal models. Many studies have investigated the roles of NTF-related p-Tau, non-amyloidogenic ADAM10, amyloidogenic BACE1, Aβ proteolytic NEP and IDE in certain ages of APP/PS1 mice as well as dendritic spine-related Rictor and Profilin-1 in normal mice, but there are few studies exploring the age-related changes of these molecules in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. Furthermore, current studies regarding when memory impairment occurs in these mice are controversial. Thus, we examined the changes of these molecules in APP/PS1 and control mice using Western blot in mice 2-month-old (2 m) to 10 m of age and behavior changes using the Morris water maze from 4 m to 8 m. The results showed that in APP/PS1 mice, significant changes of hippocampal p-Tau, Aβ, ADAM10, BACE1 and Rictor occurred at 6 m, NEP at 8 m, and IDE and Profilin-1 at 10 m. In control mice, changes of p-Tau, ADAM10, and BACE1 occurred at 8 m and NEP at 10 m, while IDE, Rictor and Profilin-1 remained unchanged. Importantly, the Morris water maze test revealed that spatial memory impairment was detected at 8 m but not 4 or 6 m. The above findings clearly evidence that neurochemical changes overtly precede cognitive dysfunctions in this AD model and provide novel knowledge for a better understanding of the molecular events driving AD.","1872-7549","Behavioural brain research","(376) 112182",2019,"Huan","Sun","H","Key Laboratory of Freshwater Fish Reproduction and Development (Ministry of Education), Key Laboratory of Aquatic Science of Chongqing, Key Laboratory of Eco-environments in Three Gorges Reservoir Region, School of Life Sciences, Southwest University, Chongqing, 400715, China."

Thus, insight into the binding differences of inhibitors to BACE1 and BACE2 is of significance for designing highly selective inhibitors toward the two proteins. In this work, multiple short molecular dynamics (MSMD) simulations are coupled with the molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM-GBSA) method to probe the binding selectivity of three inhibitors DBO, CS9, and SC7 on BACE1 over BACE2. The results show that the entropy effect plays a key role in selectivity identification of inhibitors toward BACE1 and BACE2, which determines that DBO has better selectivity toward BACE2 over BACE1, while CS9 and CS7 can more favorably bind to BACE1 than BACE2. The hierarchical clustering analysis based on energetic contributions of residues suggests that BACE1 and BACE2 share the common hot interaction spots. The residue-based free-energy decomposition method was applied to compute the inhibitor-residue interaction spectrum, and the results recognize four common binding subpockets corresponding to the different groups of inhibitors, which can be used as efficient targets for designing highly selective inhibitors toward BACE1 and BACE2. Therefore, these results provide a useful molecular basis and dynamics information for development of highly selective inhibitors targeting BACE1 and BACE2.","1948-7193","ACS chemical neuroscience","(10) 4303-4318",2019,"Jianzhong","Chen","J","School of Science , Shandong Jiaotong University , Jinan 250357 China."

Mounting evidence suggests that Aβ and mitochondrial structural and functional abnormalities are critically involved in the loss of synapses and cognitive decline, in patients with AD. In AD brain, state the sequential proteolytic cleavage of APP by beta secretase 1 enzyme (BACE1) and γ-secretase leads to the production and release of Aβ40 and 42. BACE1 expression and activity increased in the brains of AD patients. Structurally, β-secretase has a very large binding site (1000 Å) with fewer hydrophobic domains that makes a challenge to identify the specific targets/binding sites of BACE1. In the present study, we constructed a BACE1 pharmacophore with pepstatin and screened through molecular docking studies. We found one potential candidate (referred as ligand 1) that binds to the key catalytic residues of BACE1 and predicts to inhibit abnormal APP processing and reduce Aβ levels in AD neurons. Using biochemical, molecular, transmission electron microscopy, immunoblotting and immunofluorescence analyses, we studied the protective effects of ligand 1 against Aβ-induced synaptic and mitochondrial toxicities in mouse neuroblastoma (N2a) cells that express mutant APP. We found interaction between ligand 1 and BACE1 and this interaction decreased BACE1 activity, Aβ40 and 42 levels. We also found increased mitochondrial biogenesis, mitochondrial fusion and synaptic activity and reduced mitochondrial fission in ligand 1-treated mutant APP cells.

MiR-361-3p overexpression and knockdown experiments were performed and found that miR-361-3p could regulate the expression of BACE1, and the accumulation of APP-β in APPswe transfected SH-SY5Y cell. A Morris water maze test was performed and showed that overexpression of miR-361-3p improved cognitive deficits in APP/PS1 mice. We found miR-361-3p inhibited β-amyloid accumulation by targeting BACE1, which thus weakened cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease.","0219-6352","Journal of integrative neuroscience","(18) 285-291",2019,"Yangfei","Ji","Y","Department of Neurology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou City, Henan Provence, 450001, P.

Amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides, major components of amyloid plaques and crucial pathogenic molecules in terms of the amyloid hypothesis, are derived from successive proteolytic processing of amyloid-β precursor protein (APP). In this study, we established a human neuronal culture system using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to evaluate the possible effects of natural compounds on the amyloid phenotype. Unexpectedly, we found that combinational treatment of carotenoids, but not docosahexaenoic acid, significantly decreased Aβ secretion from iPSC-derived human cortical neurons. Importantly, the effects of the carotenoids resulted from specific inhibition of BACE1 activity and not from expression changes in APP or BACE1. Therefore, these results indicate a novel beneficial function of carotenoids in the anti-amyloidogenic processing of APP. Collectively, this study will shed light on neuronal protection by a novel mechanism during the pathogenesis of AD.","1872-8111","Neuroscience research","(158) 47-55",2020,"Misato","Sho","M","Department of Physiology, Keio University, School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan."

There are several factors that cause AD, like, intracellular hyperphosphorylated Tau tangles, collection of extracellular Amyloid-β42 and generation of reactive oxygen species due to mitochondrial dysfunction. This review analyses the most active target of AD and both types of AD-like early-onset AD and late-onset AD. BACE1 is a β-secretase involved in the cleavage of amyloid precursor protein and the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. The presenilin proteins play a critical role in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer malady by intervening the intramembranous cleavage of amyloid precursor protein and the generation of amyloid β. The two homologous proteins PS1 and PS2 speak to the reactant subunits of particular γ-secretase edifices that intercede an assortment of cellular processes. Natural products are common molecular platforms in drug development in AD. Many natural products are being tested in various animal model systems for their role as a potential therapeutic target in AD. Presently, there are a few theories clarifying the early mechanisms of AD pathogenesis. Recently, research advancements in the field of nanotechnology, which utilize macromolecular strategies to make drugs in nanoscale measurements, offer nanotechnology-based diagnostic tools and drug carriers which are highly sensitive for effective drug targeting in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.","1996-3181","CNS & neurological disorders drug targets","(18) 657-667",2019,"Syed S","Ahmad","SS","Department of Bioengineering, Faculty of Engineering, Integral University, Lucknow, India."

31640096,"A Curcumin Analog Reduces Levels of the Alzheimer's Disease-Associated Amyloid-β Protein by Modulating AβPP Processing and Autophagy.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a devastating neurodegenerative disease with no cure currently available. A pathological hallmark of AD is accumulation and deposition of amyloid-β protein (Aβ), a ∼4 kDa peptide generated through serial cleavage of the amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP) by β- and γ-secretases. Curcumin is a natural compound primarily found in the widely used culinary spice, turmeric, which displays therapeutic potential for AD. Recently, we reported the development of curcumin analogs and identified a lead compound, curcumin-like compound-R17 (CLC-R17), that significantly attenuates Aβ deposition in an AD transgenic mouse model. Here, we elucidated the mechanisms of this analog on Aβ levels and AβPP processing using cell models of AD. Using biochemical methods and our recently developed nanoplasmonic fiber tip probe technology, we showed that the lead compound potently lowers Aβ levels in conditioned media and reduces oligomeric amyloid levels in the cells. Furthermore, like curcumin, the lead compound attenuates the maturation of AβPP in the secretory pathway. Interestingly, it upregulated α-secretase processing of AβPP and inhibited β-secretase processing of AβPP by decreasing BACE1 protein levels. Collectively, our data reveal mechanisms of a promising curcumin analog in reducing Aβ levels, which strongly support its development as a potential therapeutic for AD.","1875-8908","Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD","(72) 761-771",2019,"Yu","Wan","Y","Genetics and Aging Research Unit, McCance Center for Brain Health, MassGeneral Institute for Neurodegenerative Disease, Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Charlestown, MA, USA."

BACE1 is one of the prime therapeutic targets for the design of inhibitors against AD as BACE1 participate in the rate-limiting step in Aβ production. Jiaranaikulwanitch et al. reported bis-tryptoline triazole (BTT) compound as a potent inhibitor against BACE1, Aβ aggregation as well as possessing metal chelation and antioxidant activity. However, the molecular mechanism of BACE1 inhibition by BTT remains unclear. Thus, molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to elucidate the inhibitory mechanism of BTT against BACE1. MD simulations highlight that BTT interact with catalytic aspartic dyad residues (Asp32 and Asp228) and active pocket residues of BACE1. The hydrogen-bond interactions, hydrophobic contacts, and π-π stacking interactions of BTT with flap residues (Val67-Asp77) of BACE1 confine the movement of the flap and help to achieve closed (non-active) conformation. The PCA analysis highlights lower conformational fluctuations for BACE1-BTT complex, which suggests enhanced conformational stability in comparison to apo-BACE1. The results of the present study provide key insights into the underlying inhibitory mechanism of BTT against BACE1 and will be helpful for the rational design of novel inhibitors with enhanced potency against BACE1.","1438-2199","Amino acids","(51) 1593-1607",2019,"Simranjeet Singh","Narang","SS","Department of Chemistry, Faculty of Basic and Applied Sciences, Sri Guru Granth Sahib World University, Fatehgarh Sahib, Punjab, 140406, India."

Although photobiomodulation therapy (PBMT), as a novel noninvasive physiotherapy strategy, has been proposed to improve neuronal survival, decrease neuron loss, ameliorate dendritic atrophy, and provide overall AD improvement, it remains unknown whether and how this neuroprotective process affects Aβ levels. Here, we report that PBMT reduced Aβ production and plaque formation by shifting amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing toward the nonamyloidogenic pathway, thereby improving memory and cognitive ability in a mouse model of AD. More importantly, a pivotal protein, SIRT1, was involved in this process by specifically up-regulating ADAM10 and down-regulating BACE1, which is dependent on the cAMP/PKA pathway in APP/PS1 primary neurons and SH-SY5Y cells stably expressing human APP Swedish mutation (APPswe). We further found that the activity of the mitochondrial photoacceptor cytochrome c oxidase (CcO) was responsible for PBMT-induced activation of PKA and SIRT1.

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the aberrant expression levels of these proteins in the pathogenesis of AD are still not completely understood. Tid1 (DnaJA3/mtHsp40), a mammalian homolog of the Drosophila tumor suppressor Tid56, is reported to induce mitochondrial fragmentation associated with an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, resulting in cell death in some cancer cells. However, the involvement of Tid1 in AD pathogenesis is as yet unknown. In this study, we found that the Tid1 protein levels were upregulated in the hippocampus of AD patients and Tg2576 mice. Our in vitro studies showed that Aβ42 increased the expression levels of Tid1 in primary rat cortical neurons. The knockdown of Tid1 protected against neuronal cell death induced by Aβ42, and Tid1-mediated neuronal cell death, was dependent on the increased ROS generation and caspase-3 activity. The overexpression of Tid1 in HEK293-APP cells increased the BACE1 levels, resulting in increased Aβ production. Conversely, Tid1 knockdown in HEK293-APP cells and primary cultured neurons decreased Aβ production through the reduction in the BACE1 levels. We also found that the overexpression of Tid1 activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) leading to increased Aβ production. Taken together, our results suggest that upregulated Tid1 levels in the hippocampus of patients with AD and Tg2576 mice induce apoptosis and increase Aβ production, and Tid1 may therefore be a suitable target in therapeutic interventions for AD.","1559-1182","Molecular neurobiology","(57) 1099-1114",2020,"Chunyu","Zhou","C","Department of Biochemistry, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, 1 Kawasumi, Mizuho-cho, Mizuho-ku, Nagoya, Aichi, 467-8601, Japan."

Calculations for all submissions (except for one, which used AutoDock4.2) were performed using AutoDock-GPU, the new GPU-accelerated version of AutoDock4 implemented in OpenCL, which features a gradient-based local search. The pose prediction challenge was organized in two stages. In Stage 1a, the protein conformations associated with each of the ligands were undisclosed, so we docked each ligand to a set of eleven receptor conformations, chosen to maximize the diversity of binding pocket topography. Protein conformations were made available in Stage 1b, making it a re-docking task. For all calculations, macrocyclic conformations were sampled on the fly during docking, taking the target structure into account. To leverage information from existing structures containing BACE1 bound to ligands available in the PDB, we tested biased docking and pose filter protocols to facilitate poses resembling those experimentally determined. Both pose filters and biased docking resulted in more accurate docked poses, enabling us to predict for both Stages 1a and 1b ligand poses within 2 Å RMSD from the crystallographic pose. Nevertheless, many of the ligands could be correctly docked without using existing structural information, demonstrating the usefulness of physics-based scoring functions, such as the one used in AutoDock4, for structure based drug design.","1573-4951","Journal of computer-aided molecular design","(33) 1071-1081",2019,"Diogo","Santos-Martins","D","Department of Integrative Structural and Computational Biology, The Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, USA."
31701556,"Tau deletion reduces plaque-associated BACE1 accumulation and decelerates plaque formation in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.","In Alzheimer's disease, BACE1 protease initiates the amyloidogenic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) that eventually results in synthesis of β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide. Aβ deposition in turn causes accumulation of BACE1 in plaque-associated dystrophic neurites, thereby potentiating progressive Aβ deposition once initiated. Since systemic pharmacological BACE inhibition causes adverse effects in humans, it is important to identify strategies that specifically normalize overt BACE1 activity around plaques. The microtubule-associated protein tau regulates axonal transport of proteins, and tau deletion rescues Aβ-induced transport deficits in vitro. In the current study, long-term in vivo two-photon microscopy and immunohistochemistry were performed in tau-deficient APPPS1 mice. Tau deletion reduced plaque-associated axonal pathology and BACE1 accumulation without affecting physiological BACE1 expression distant from plaques. Thereby, tau deletion effectively decelerated formation of new plaques and reduced plaque compactness. The data revealed that tau reinforces Aβ deposition, presumably by contributing to accumulation of BACE1 in plaque-associated dystrophies. Targeting tau-dependent mechanisms could become a suitable strategy to specifically reduce overt BACE1 activity around plaques, thereby avoiding adverse effects of systemic BACE inhibition.","1460-2075","The EMBO journal","(38) e102345",2019,"Finn","Peters","F","German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Munich, Germany."

Accordingly, it has been reported that melatonin level is disturbed in both DM and AD which indicates its involvement in the pathophysiology of these diseases. In this study, the neuroprotective activities and relevant mechanisms of melatonin were evaluated in diabetic rat model. Rats were subcutaneously injected with melatonin (10 mg/kg) for 42 consecutive days. Single dose of streptozotocin (60 mg/kg STZ) was intraperitoneally injected. Morris water maze, Western blot and immunohistochemistry analysis of proteins in the hippocampus were measured. We found that melatonin was effective in protecting against memory impairment and decreased formation of Aβ42 peptide and phosphorylated tau in the hippocampus of STZ-treated rats. Melatonin significantly restored the reduction in phospho-insulin receptor β (p-IRβ) and ameliorated the increase of inhibitory phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) in STZ-treated rats. Furthermore, it restored the phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β), indicating a decreased activity of GSK3β. Melatonin prevented amyloidogenic processing of β-amyloid precursor protein (βAPP) by significantly inhibited β-site APP cleaving enzyme (BACE1), presenilin 1 (PS1), and β-cleaved C-terminal fragment (C99). In conclusion, melatonin ameliorates memory deficits in STZ-induced hyperglycemia rats by restoring insulin signaling pathway which is independent of its effects on blood glucose and insulin levels.

Picrorhiza kurroa Bentham, Scrophulariae (PK) is a medicinal herb that has been traditionally used for the treatment of various diseases, including inflammation. This study aims to report the significance of PK treatment in markedly improving spatial learning memory and dramatically decreasing Aβ levels in Tg6799 mice, also known 5xFAD mice, which have five familial AD (FAD) mutations. Remarkably, these effects correlated with reversal of disease-related microglial neuroinflammation, as evidenced by shifting microglia phenotypes from the inflammatory form to the anti-inflammatory form and inhibiting the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine-rich repeat, and pyrin domain containing 3 inflammasome activity. Moreover, PK administration induced silent information regulator type1/peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ signaling, resulting in a decrease of β-secretase 1 (BACE1) expression, which involved in Aβ production.

Additionally, we aimed to determine whether the pathological impact of isolation stress could be prevented through exposure to exercise alone or to exercise and an enriched environment throughout the isolation period.

Isolated animals also displayed a significant cognitive deficit in contextual fear-conditioning, independent of genotype. Furthermore, neither exercise nor an enriched environment were able to prevent these isolation-induced effects.

Such signals include membrane-associated proteins of the oligodendrocyte plasma membrane and astrocyte-derived, matrix-associated proteins. Here, using cell lines and primary cortical neuron cultures, recombinant protein expression, immunoprecipitation and immunoblot assays, transmission EM of exosomes, and axon regeneration assays, we explored the secretion and activity of the myelin-associated neurite outgrowth inhibitor Nogo-A and observed exosomal release of a 24-kDa C-terminal Nogo-A fragment from cultured cells. We found that the cleavage site in this 1192-amino-acid-long fragment is located between amino acids 961-971. We also detected a Nogo-66 receptor (NgR1)-interacting Nogo-66 domain on the exosome surface. Enzyme inhibitor treatment and siRNA knockdown revealed that β-secretase 1 (BACE1) is the protease responsible for Nogo-A cleavage. Functionally, exosomes with the Nogo-66 domain on their surface potently inhibited axonal regeneration of mechanically injured cerebral cortex neurons from mice. Production of this fragment was observed in the exosomal fraction from neuronal tissue lysates after spinal cord crush injury of mice. We also noted that, relative to the exosomal marker Alix, a Nogo-immunoreactive, 24-kDa protein is enriched in exosomes 2-fold after injury. We conclude that membrane-associated Nogo-A produced in oligodendrocytes is processed proteolytically by BACE1, is released via exosomes, and is a potent diffusible inhibitor of regenerative growth in NgR1-expressing axons.","1083-351X","The Journal of biological chemistry","(295) 2175-2183",2020,"Yuichi","Sekine","Y","Cellular Neuroscience, Neurodegeneration, and Repair Program, Departments of Neurology and of Neuroscience, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06536."

Dysregulated expressions of several genes have been documented in ASD patients. The current project aimed at comparison of transcript levels of brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), and their natural occurring antisenses in the peripheral blood of ASD individuals (n = 50, male/female = 38/12, age (mean ± standard deviation (SD)): 6 ± 1.4, age range: 3-8) and matched healthy persons (n = 50, male/female = 37/13, age (mean ± SD): 6 ± 1.74, age range: 3-8). We demonstrated remarkable higher levels of these genes in ASD patients. BACE1 transcript levels were correlated with transcript levels of BACE1-AS in all study participants. However, BACE1 transcript levels were not correlated with participants' age. BACE1-AS and BDNF transcript levels were correlated with age in female participants. Significant correlations were detected between transcript levels of BDNF and those of other genes in all study groups. The current results render further indications for contribution of BDNF, BACE1, and their antisenses in the course of ASD and suggested expression levels of these transcripts as putative markers for this neurobehavioral disorder. Such results might be applied in clinical setting for diagnosis of complicated ASD cases.","1559-1166","Journal of molecular neuroscience : MN","(70) 194-200",2020,"Soudeh","Ghafouri-Fard","S","Department of Medical Genetics, Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran."

31768942,"Neuroprotective Effects of Apocynin and Galantamine During the Chronic Administration of Scopolamine in an Alzheimer's Disease Model.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the most complicated neurodegenerative diseases, and several hypotheses have been associated with its development and progression, such as those involving glucose hypometabolism, the cholinergic system, calcium imbalance, inflammation, oxidative imbalance, microtubule instability, and the amyloid cascade, several of which are related to oxidative stress (free radical generation), which contributes to neuronal death. Therefore, several efforts have been made to establish a sporadic AD model that takes into account these hypotheses. One model that replicates the increase in amyloid beta (Aβ) and oxidative stress in vivo is the scopolamine model. In the present work, the chronic administration (6 weeks) of scopolamine was used to analyze the neuroprotective effects of apocynin and galantamine. The results showed that scopolamine induced cognitive impairment, which was evaluated 24 h after the final dose was administered. In addition, after scopolamine administration, the Aβ and superoxide anion levels were increased, and NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2), nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), and nuclear factor kappa B (NFkB) genes were overexpressed. These effects were not observed when either apocynin or galantamine was administered during the last 3 weeks of scopolamine treatment, and although the results from both molecules were related to lower Aβ production and, consequently, lower superoxide anion production, they were likely realized through different pathways. That is, both apocynin and galantamine diminished NADPH oxidase expression, but their effects on transcription factor expression differed. Moreover, experiments in silico showed that galantamine did not interact with the active site of beta secretase, whereas diapocynin, an apocynin metabolite, interacted with the beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme (BACE1) at the catalytic site.","1559-1166","Journal of molecular neuroscience : MN","(70) 180-193",2020,"Eliezer","Joseph","E","Laboratorio de Biofísica y Biocatálisis, Sección de Estudios de Posgrado, Escuela Superior de Medicina, Instituto Politécnico Nacional, Plan de San Luis y Díaz Mirón s/n, 11340, México City, México."

This review highlights recent advances in the identification of the aberrantly expressed miRNAs and lncRNAs in circulatory network for detection of AD.

31792364,"Blood biomarkers for memory: toward early detection of risk for Alzheimer disease, pharmacogenomics, and repurposed drugs.","Short-term memory dysfunction is a key early feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Psychiatric patients may be at higher risk for memory dysfunction and subsequent AD due to the negative effects of stress and depression on the brain. We carried out longitudinal within-subject studies in male and female psychiatric patients to discover blood gene expression biomarkers that track short term memory as measured by the retention measure in the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test. These biomarkers were subsequently prioritized with a convergent functional genomics approach using previous evidence in the field implicating them in AD. The top candidate biomarkers were then tested in an independent cohort for ability to predict state short-term memory, and trait future positive neuropsychological testing for cognitive impairment. The best overall evidence was for a series of new, as well as some previously known genes, which are now newly shown to have functional evidence in humans as blood biomarkers: RAB7A, NPC2, TGFB1, GAP43, ARSB, PER1, GUSB, and MAPT. Additional top blood biomarkers include GSK3B, PTGS2, APOE, BACE1, PSEN1, and TREM2, well known genes implicated in AD by previous brain and genetic studies, in humans and animal models, which serve as reassuring de facto positive controls for our whole-genome gene expression discovery approach. Biological pathway analyses implicate LXR/RXR activation, neuroinflammation, atherosclerosis signaling, and amyloid processing. Co-directionality of expression data provide new mechanistic insights that are consistent with a compensatory/scarring scenario for brain pathological changes. A majority of top biomarkers also have evidence for involvement in other psychiatric disorders, particularly stress, providing a molecular basis for clinical co-morbidity and for stress as an early precipitant/risk factor. Some of them are modulated by existing drugs, such as antidepressants, lithium and omega-3 fatty acids. Other drug and nutraceutical leads were identified through bioinformatic drug repurposing analyses (such as pioglitazone, levonorgestrel, salsolidine, ginkgolide A, and icariin). Our work contributes to the overall pathophysiological understanding of memory disorders and AD.

31796114,"The amyloid-β degradation intermediate Aβ34 is pericyte-associated and reduced in brain capillaries of patients with Alzheimer's disease.","An impairment of amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) clearance is suggested to play a key role in the pathogenesis of sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid degradation is mediated by various mechanisms including fragmentation by enzymes like neprilysin, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and a recently identified amyloidolytic activity of β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1). BACE1 cleavage of Aβ40 and Aβ42 results in the formation of a common Aβ34 intermediate which was found elevated in cerebrospinal fluid levels of patients at the earliest disease stages. To further investigate the role of Aβ34 as a marker for amyloid clearance in AD, we performed a systematic and comprehensive analysis of Aβ34 immunoreactivity in hippocampal and cortical post-mortem brain tissue from AD patients and non-demented elderly individuals. In early Braak stages, Aβ34 was predominantly detectable in a subset of brain capillaries associated with pericytes, while in later disease stages, in clinically diagnosed AD, this pericyte-associated Aβ34 immunoreactivity was largely lost. Aβ34 was also detected in isolated human cortical microvessels associated with brain pericytes and its levels correlated with Aβ40, but not with Aβ42 levels. Moreover, a significantly decreased Aβ34/Aβ40 ratio was observed in microvessels from AD patients in comparison to non-demented controls suggesting a reduced proteolytic degradation of Aβ40 to Aβ34 in AD. In line with the hypothesis that pericytes at the neurovascular unit are major producers of Aβ34, biochemical studies in cultured human primary pericytes revealed a time and dose dependent increase of Aβ34 levels upon treatment with recombinant Aβ40 peptides while Aβ34 production was impaired when Aβ40 uptake was reduced or BACE1 activity was inhibited. Collectively, our findings indicate that Aβ34 is generated by a novel BACE1-mediated Aβ clearance pathway in pericytes of brain capillaries. As amyloid clearance is significantly reduced in AD, impairment of this pathway might be a major driver of the pathogenesis in sporadic AD.","2051-5960","Acta neuropathologica communications","(7) 194",2019,"Tunahan","Kirabali","T","Institute for Regenerative Medicine, University of Zurich, 8952, Schlieren, Switzerland."
31815371,"Comprehensive Exploration of Target-specific Ligands Using a Graph Convolution Neural Network.","Machine learning approaches are widely used to evaluate ligand activities of chemical compounds toward potential target proteins. Especially, exploration of highly selective ligands is important for the development of new drugs with higher safety. One difficulty in constructing well-performing model predicting such a ligand activity is the absence of data on true negative ligand-protein interactions. In other words, in many cases we can access to plenty of information on ligands that bind to specific protein, but less or almost no information showing that compounds don't bind to proteins of interest. In this paper, we suggested an approach to comprehensively explore candidates for ligands specifically targeting toward proteins without using information on the true negative interaction. The approach consists of 4 steps: 1) constructing a model that distinguishes ligands for the target proteins of interest from those targeting proteins that cause off-target effects, by using graph convolution neural network (GCNN); 2) extracting feature vectors after convolution/pooling processes and mapping their principal components in two dimensions; 3) specifying regions with higher density for two ligand groups through kernel density estimation; and 4) investigating the distribution of compounds for exploration on the density map using the same classifier and decomposer. If compounds for exploration are located in higher-density regions of ligand compounds, these compounds can be regarded as having relatively high binding affinity to the major target or off-target proteins compared with other compounds. We applied the approach to the exploration of ligands for β-site amyloid precursor protein [APP]-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), a major target for Alzheimer Disease (AD), with less off-target effect toward cathepsin D. We demonstrated that the density region of BACE1 and cathepsin D ligands are well-divided, and a group of natural compounds as a target for exploration of new drug candidates also has significantly different distribution on the density map.","1868-1751","Molecular informatics","(39) e1900095",2020,"Yu","Miyazaki","Y","Division of Information Science, Graduate School of Science and Technology, Nara Institute of Science and Technology, 8916-5 Takayama, Ikoma, Nara, 630-0192, Japan."

Moreover, BZD reduced the protein levels of BACE1 and PS1, resulting in a reduction of Aβ plaques. We also identified a beneficial effect of BZD on oxidative stress by attenuating MDA levels and SOD activity in the brains of 5xFAD mice. Together, these results indicate that BZD produces a dose-dependent positive effect on 5xFAD transgenic mouse model by decreasing APP processing and Aβ plaques, and by ameliorating oxidative damage.

Using biochemical and Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based imaging approaches we have found that Syn1 knock down decreases, whereas (over)expression of Syn1 in cells increases the Aβ levels. Mechanistically, Syn1 does not seem to affect the activity of Presenilin 1 (PS1)/γ-secretase, PS1 conformation, or the proximity between PS1 and amyloid precursor protein (APP). However, we found that Syn1 is involved in up-regulation of the β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1)/β-secretase activity and increases the APP/BACE1 interaction.

To date, most of the studies investigating proteolytic processing of neuregulins focused on NRG1, which was shown to undergo ectodomain shedding by several ADAM proteases and BACE1 and the remaining fragment was further cleaved by γ-secretase. Recently, NRG2 attracted more attention due to its role in the neurogenesis and modulation of behaviors associated with psychiatric disorders. In this study, we used genetic engineering methods to identify proteases involved in proteolytic processing of murine NRG2. Using non-neuronal cell lines as well as cultures of primary hippocampal neurons, we demonstrated that the major proteases responsible for releasing NRG2 ectodomain are ADAM10 and BACE2. Co-expression of NRG2 and BACE2 in neurons of certain brain structures including medulla oblongata and cerebellar deep nuclei was confirmed via immunohistochemical staining. The cleavage of NRG2 by ADAM10 or BACE2 generates a C-terminal fragment that serves as a substrate for γ-secretase.

Here, we have employed a tamoxifen inducible BACE1 conditional Knock-out (cKO) mouse model to achieve a controlled partial depletion of BACE1 in adult mice. Biochemical and behavioural characterization was performed at two time points: 4-5 months (young mice) and 12-13 months (aged mice). A ~50% to ~70% BACE1 protein reduction in hippocampus and cortex, respectively, induced a significant reduction of BACE1 substrates processing and decrease of Aβx-40 levels at both ages. Hippocampal axonal guidance and peripheral nerve myelination were not affected. Aged mice displayed a CA1 long-term potentiation (LTP) deficit that was not associated with memory impairment. Our findings indicate that numerous phenotypes observed in germline BACE1 KO reflect a fundamental role of BACE1 during development while other phenotypes, observed in adult cKO, may be absent when partially rather than completely deleting BACE1.

Its inhibition is a major therapeutic approach in Alzheimer's disease, because BACE1 cleaves the amyloid precursor protein (APP), thereby catalyzing the first step in the generation of the pathogenic amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide. Yet, BACE1 cleaves numerous additional membrane proteins besides APP. Most of these substrates have been identified in vitro, but only few were further validated or characterized in vivo. To identify BACE1 substrates with in vivo relevance, we used isotope label-based quantitative proteomics of wild type and BACE1-deficient (BACE1 KO) mouse brains. This approach identified known BACE1 substrates, including Close homolog of L1 and contactin-2, which were found to be enriched in the membrane fraction of BACE1 KO brains. VWFA and cache domain-containing protein 1 (CACHD)1 and MAM domain-containing glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor protein 1 (MDGA1), which have functions in synaptic transmission, were identified and validated as new BACE1 substrates in vivo by immunoblots using primary neurons and mouse brains. Inhibition or deletion of BACE1 from primary neurons resulted in a pronounced inhibition of substrate cleavage and a concomitant increase in full-length protein levels of CACHD1 and MDGA1. The BACE1 cleavage site in both proteins was determined to be located within the juxtamembrane domain. In summary, this study identifies and validates CACHD1 and MDGA1 as novel in vivo substrates for BACE1, suggesting that cleavage of both proteins may contribute to the numerous functions of BACE1 in the nervous system.","1530-6860","FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology","(34) 2465-2482",2020,"Jasenka","Rudan Njavro","J","German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Munich, Germany."
31914599,"BHBA treatment improves cognitive function by targeting pleiotropic mechanisms in transgenic mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.","Accumulation of amyloid β (Aβ) peptide, inflammation, and oxidative stress contribute to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and trigger complex pathogenesis. The ketone body β-hydroxybutyrate (BHBA) is an endogenous metabolic intermediate that protects against stroke and neurodegenerative diseases, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. The present study aims to elucidate the protective effects of BHBA in the early stage of AD model and investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms. Three-and-half-month-old double-transgenic mice (5XFAD) overexpressing β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin-1 (PS1) were used as the AD model. The 5XFAD mice received 1.5 mmol/kg/d BHBA subcutaneously for 28 days. Morris water maze test, nest construction, and passive avoidance experiments were performed to assess the therapeutic effects on AD prevention in vivo, and brain pathology of 5XFAD mice including amyloid plaque deposition and microglia activation were assessed. Gene expression profiles in the cortexes of 5XFAD- and BHBA-treated 5XFAD mice were performed with high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatic analysis. Mouse HT22 cells were treated with 2 mM BHBA to explore its in vitro protective effects of BHBA on hippocampal neurons against Aβ oligomer toxicity, ATP production, ROS generation, and mitochondrial aerobic respiratory function. APP, BACE1, and neprilysin (NEP) expression levels were evaluated in HT22 cells following treatment with BHBA by measuring the presence or absence of G protein-coupled receptor 109A (GPR109A). BHBA improved cognitive function of 5XFAD mice in Morris water maze test, nesting construction and passive avoidance experiments, and attenuated Aβ accumulation and microglia overactivation in the brain. BHBA also enhanced mitochondrial respiratory function of hippocampal neurons and protected it from Aβ toxicity. The enzymes, APP and NEP were regulated by BHBA via G-protein-coupled receptor 109A (GPR109A). Furthermore, RNA sequencing revealed that BHBA-regulated genes mainly annotated in aging, immune system, nervous system, and neurodegenerative diseases. Our data suggested that BHBA confers protection against the AD-like pathological events in the AD mouse model by targeting multiple aspects of AD and it may become a promising candidate for the prevention and treatment of AD.","1530-6860","FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology","(34) 1412-1429",2020,"Yancheng","Wu","Y","Innovative Institute of Animal Healthy Breeding, Key Laboratory of Waterfowl Healthy Breeding of Guangdong Province, College of Animal Sciences and Technology, Zhongkai University of Agriculture and Engineering, Guangzhou, P.R.

31915042,"Contribution of GABAergic interneurons to amyloid-β plaque pathology in an APP knock-in mouse model.","The amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide, the primary constituent of amyloid plaques found in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brains, is derived from sequential proteolytic processing of the Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP). However, the contribution of different cell types to Aβ deposition has not yet been examined in an in vivo, non-overexpression system. Here, we show that endogenous APP is highly expressed in a heterogeneous subset of GABAergic interneurons throughout various laminae of the hippocampus, suggesting that these cells may have a profound contribution to AD plaque pathology. We then characterized the laminar distribution of amyloid burden in the hippocampus of an APP knock-in mouse model of AD. To examine the contribution of GABAergic interneurons to plaque pathology, we blocked Aβ production specifically in these cells using a cell type-specific knock-out of BACE1. We found that during early stages of plaque deposition, interneurons contribute to approximately 30% of the total plaque load in the hippocampus. The greatest contribution to plaque load (75%) occurs in the stratum pyramidale of CA1, where plaques in human AD cases are most prevalent and where pyramidal cell bodies and synaptic boutons from perisomatic-targeting interneurons are located. These findings reveal a crucial role of GABAergic interneurons in the pathology of AD. Our study also highlights the necessity of using APP knock-in models to correctly evaluate the cellular contribution to amyloid burden since APP overexpressing transgenic models drive expression in cell types according to the promoter and integration site and not according to physiologically relevant expression mechanisms.","1750-1326","Molecular neurodegeneration","(15) 3",2020,"Heather C","Rice","HC","VIB Center for Brain & Disease Research, Leuven, Belgium."

A number of factors have been proposed regarding pathology of AD, such as presence of β-amyloid, and cholinergic and oxidative stress. SAK3 (ethyl 8'-methyl-2',5-dioxo-2-piperidin-1-ylspiro[cyclopentene-3,3'-imidazo[1,2-a]pyridine]-1-carboxylate) reduces β-amyloid deposition and improves cognitive functions in amyloid precursor protein knock-in mice. Scopolamine is used to induce in cell lines a cholinergic deficit that mimics AD. In order to evaluate the possible neuroprotective properties of SAK3, human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells were pretreated with the compound (25-100 nM) and further incubated in the presence of scopolamine (2 mM). SAK3 inhibited scopolamine-induced cellular apoptosis (morphologically and by determination of pro- and anti-apoptotic factor levels), increase in ROS levels, decrease in choline acetyltransferase level, phosphorylation of NF-κB, activation of Akt, JNK and p38 intracellular signaling pathways, and elevation of proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β and IL-6, but not enhanced level of β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1). These results indicate SAK3 possessed protective properties against cholinergic deficit associated with anti-oxidant, anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory activities, suggesting that SAK3 might be a potential agent in the development of AD drug therapeutics.","0920-9069","Cytotechnology","(72) 155-164",2020,"Nopparat","Suthprasertporn","N","Research Center for Neuroscience, Institute of Molecular Biosciences, Mahidol University, Salaya, Nakhonpathom, 73170, Thailand."

This imaging probe was built upon iron oxide nanoparticles (cross-linked dextran iron oxide nanoparticles, or CLIO). Peptide substrates containing a terminal near-infrared fluorochrome (fluorophore emitting at 775 nm for CatD or fluorophore emitting at 669 nm for BACE1) were conjugated to the CLIO nanoparticles. The CatD substrate contained a phenylalanine-phenylalanine cleavage site more specific to CatD than BACE1. The BACE1 substrate contained the sequence surrounding the leucine-asparagine cleavage site of the BACE1 found in the Swedish mutation of APP, which is more specific to BACE1 than CatD. These fluorescently-labeled peptide substrates were then conjugated to the nanoparticle. The nanoparticle probes were purified by gel filtration, and their fluorescence intensities were determined using a fluorescence plate reader. The CatD peptide substrate demonstrated a 15.5-fold increase in fluorescence when incubated with purified CatD enzyme, and the BACE1 substrate exhibited a 31.5-fold increase in fluorescence when incubated with purified BACE1 enzyme. Probe specificity was also demonstrated in the human H4 neuroglioma cells and the H4 cells stably transfected with BACE1 in which the probe monitored enzymatic cleavage. In the H4 and H4-BACE1 cells, BACE1 and active CatD activity increased, an occurrence that was reflected in enzyme expression levels as determined by immunoblotting. These results demonstrate the applicability of this probe for detecting potential Alzheimer's enzyme biomarkers.","1420-3049","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)","E274",2020,"Jenny M","Tam","JM","Wyss Institute and Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA."

The p-tau tangle unit is a posttranslational modification of normal tau protein. Aβ is a neurotoxic peptide excised from the amyloid-β precursor protein (APP) by β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and the γ-secretase complex. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, single-stranded RNAs that modulate protein expression as part of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). We identified miR-298 as a repressor of APP, BACE1, and the two primary forms of Aβ (Aβ40 and Aβ42) in a primary human cell culture model. Further, we discovered a novel effect of miR-298 on posttranslational levels of two specific tau moieties. Notably, miR-298 significantly reduced levels of ~55 and 50 kDa forms of the tau protein without significant alterations of total tau or other forms. In vivo overexpression of human miR-298 resulted in nonsignificant reduction of APP, BACE1, and tau in mice. Moreover, we identified two miR-298 SNPs associated with higher cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) p-tau and lower CSF Aβ42 levels in a cohort of human AD patients. Finally, levels of miR-298 varied in postmortem human temporal lobe between AD patients and age-matched non-AD controls.

Limited studies have shown that serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 (SGK1) is involved in spatial memory formation and consolidation, but its role in AD-like spatial memory impairment and the related mechanisms are not clear. In this study, we first examined the age-related changes of SGK1 in the hippocampus of female APP/PS1 (AD) mice. Based on the finding and our previous finding that significant spatial memory impairment was detected in 8-month old AD mice, SGK1-overexpressing AAV (oSGK1) was constructed and injected into the hippocampus of 9-month old AD mice. One month later, the behavior alterations, Aβ production and deposit as well as changes of CA1 spine density and selected actin polymerization remodeling proteins were examined. The results showed that significant decrease of SGK1 was detected in 10-month old AD mice. The spatial memory impairment, the production and deposit of Aβ were reversed by oSGK1. Levels of hippocampal ADAM10 (α-secretase) and IDE (Aβ degradase), actin remodeling related proteins Rictor, Rac1, Cdc42 and Profilin-1 were significantly increased after oSGK1 treatment while hippocampal BACE1 (γ-secretase) and Cofilin remained unchanged. Taken together, our findings demonstrated a pivotal role of SGK1 in the treatment of AD-related memory impairment through upregulation of non- amyloidogenic processing of APP and degradation of Aβ, increase in spine plasticity related proteins, indicating increase in hippocampal SGK1 may be a potent therapeutic target against AD.","1872-7549","Behavioural brain research","(383) 112503",2020,"Biyao","Lian","B","Department of Histology and Embryology, Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan, 750004, China."

LF has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant functions, which exert neuroprotective effects against AD. However, its effects on memory impairment and AD pathogenesis have not been fully examined. In this study, we examined the effects of LF on memory impairment and AD pathogenesis in AβPP-Tg mice (J20 mice). Nine-month-old J20 mice were fed with control, 2% lactoferrin-containing (LF), and 0.5% pepsin-hydrolyzed lactoferrin-containing (LF-hyd) diets for 3 months. We found that both the LF and LF-hyd diets attenuated memory impairment in J20 mice and decreased brain Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels through the inhibition of amyloidogenic processing of AβPP, as it decreased β-site amyloid protein precursor cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) levels. Furthermore, we found for the first time that LF and LF-hyd treatments increased both ApoE secretion and ATP-binding cassette A1 (ABCA1) protein levels in the brains of J20 mice and in primary astrocyte cultures. Moreover, LF and LF-hyd promoted extracellular degradation of Aβ in primary astrocyte cultures. These findings indicate that the reduction in Aβ levels in the brains of mice fed with both the LF and LF-hyd diets may also be mediated by increased ApoE secretion and ABCA1 protein levels, which in turn leads to the enhanced degradation of Aβ in the brains of J20 mice. Our findings suggest that LF and LF-hyd can be used for the treatment and/or prevention of the development of AD.","1875-8908","Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD","(74) 245-259",2020,"Mona","Abdelhamid","M","Department of Biochemistry, Nagoya City University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Mizuho-ku, Nagoya, Aichi, Japan."

The results revealed that pretreatment with STS (1, 10 and 100 µmol/L) for 24 hours could protect against Aβ (10 µmol/L)-induced cell toxicity in a dose-dependent manner in the SH-SY5Y cells. Sodium tanshinone IIA sulfonate decreased the concentrations of reactive oxygen species, malondialdehyde, NO and iNOS, while increased the activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase in the SH-SY5Y cells. Sodium tanshinone IIA sulfonate decreased the levels of inflammatory factors (IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α) in the SH-SY5Y cells. In addition, Western blot results revealed that the expressions of neprilysin and insulin-degrading enzyme were up-regulated in the SH-SY5Y cells after STS treatment. Furthermore, ELISA and Western blot results showed that STS could decrease the levels of Aβ. ELISA and qPCR results indicated that STS could increase α-secretase (ADAM10) activity and decrease β-secretase (BACE1) activity. In conclusion, STS could protect against Aβ-induced cell damage by modulating Aβ degration and generation.

Higher levels of Aβ processing in TgCRND8 tissue coincides with decreased NOTCH3/JAG1 signalling, overproduction of endothelial filopodia and increased numbers of vascular pericytes. Using a novel in vitro approach to study sprouting angiogenesis in TgCRND8 organotypic brain slice cultures (OBSCs), we find that BACE1 inhibition normalises excessive endothelial filopodia formation and restores NOTCH3 signalling.

Interestingly, this occurs in association with the unbalanced expression of two of its RNA Binding proteins (RBPs) opposite regulators, the Fragile-X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP) and the heteronuclear Ribonucleoprotein C (hnRNP C). Whether an augmentation in overall translational efficiency also contributes to the elevation of APP levels at those early developmental stages is currently unknown. We investigated this possibility by performing a longitudinal polyribosome profiling analysis of APP mRNA and protein in total hippocampal extracts from Tg2576 mice. Results showed that protein polysomal signals were exclusively detected in pre-symptomatic (1 months) and early symptomatic (3 months) mutant mice. Differently, hAPP mRNA polysomal signals were detected at any age, but a peak of expression was found when mice were 3-month old. Consistent with an early but transient rise of translational efficiency, the phosphorylated form of the initial translation factor eIF2α (p-eIF2α) was reduced at pre-symptomatic and early symptomatic stages, whereas it was increased at the fully symptomatic stage. Pharmacological downregulation of overall translation in early symptomatic mutants was then found to reduce hippocampal levels of full length APP, Aβspecies, BACE1 and Caspase-3, to rescue predominant LTD at hippocampal synapses, to revert dendritic spine loss and memory alterations, and to reinstate memory-induced c-fosactivation. Altogether, our findings demonstrate that overall translation is upregulated in prodromal and early symptomatic Tg2576 mice, and that restoring proper translational control at the onset of AD-like symptoms blocks the emergence of the AD-like phenotype.","1095-953X","Neurobiology of disease","(139) 104787",2020,"Antonella","Borreca","A","Institute of Neuroscience-National Research Council (CNR), Via Vanvitelli, 32 20129 Milano, Italy; Humanitas University, Department of Biomedical Sciences, Via Rita Levi Montalcini 4, 20090 Pieve Emanuele - Milan, Italy.

Thus, we exposed 4-week-old male mice to 0.2 % lead acetate solution for one month, then, conducted behavioral tests or extracted brain homogenate from mice prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus at the age of 4, 13 and 16-month-old respectively. Our results showed that treated mice exhibited an evident increase in latency to reach platform following pubertal Pb exposure and aging. The increase of 8-OHdG revealed evident neural DNA oxidative damage across time upon pubertal Pb exposure. In the hippocampus of lead exposed mice at three age nodes, the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor precursor (proBDNF) increased, while that of mature BDNF (mBDNF), cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB) and phosphorylated CREB (pCREB) decreased compared with the control group. Furthermore, the expression of BACE1 protein and tau phosphorylation level in PFC and hippocampus increased, APP mRNAs in PFC and prolonged induction of BACE1 in hippocampus. Our results show that chronic Pb exposure from pubertal stage onward can either initiate divergent synaptic-related gene expression patterns in adulthood or trigger time-course of neurodegenerative profile within the PFC or hippocampus, which can contribute consistent deficits of cognition across subsequent age-nodes.","1872-7077","Environmental toxicology and pharmacology","(76) 103350",2020,"Zuntao","Wu","Z","College of Public Health, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, PR China."

The tau protein is encoded by the MAPT gene. Recently, the H1 and H2 haplotypes of the MAPT gene were associated with AD risk. The minor MAPT H2 haplotype has been linked with a decreased risk of developing late-onset AD (LOAD). MAPT haplotypes show different levels of MAPT/Tau expression with H1 being ∼1.5-fold more expressed than H2, suggesting that MAPT expression level could be related to LOAD risk. In this study, we investigated whether this moderate difference in MAPT/Tau expression could influence Aβ-induced toxicity in vivo. We show that modest overexpression of tau protein in Drosophila exacerbates neuronal phenotypes in AβPP/BACE1 flies. The exacerbation of neuronal defects correlates with the accumulation of insoluble dTau oligomers, suggesting that the moderate difference in level of tau expression observed between H1 and H2 haplotypes could influence Aβ toxicity through the production of oligomeric tau insoluble species.","1875-8908","Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD","(74) 637-647",2020,"Laetitia","Miguel","L","Normandie Univ, UNIROUEN, Inserm U1245 and Rouen University Hospital, Department of Genetics and CNR-MAJ, Normandy Center for Genomic and Personalized Medicine, Rouen, France."
32066688,"Rivastigmine modifies the α-secretase pathway and potentially early Alzheimer's disease.","Rivastigmine (or Exelon) is a cholinesterase inhibitor, currently used as a symptomatic treatment for mild-to-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). Amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) generated from its precursor protein (APP) by β-secretase (or BACE1) and γ-secretase endoproteolysis. Alternative APP cleavage by α-secretase (a family of membrane-bound metalloproteases- Adamalysins) precludes the generation of toxic Aβ and yields a neuroprotective and neurotrophic secreted sAPPα fragment. Several signal transduction pathways, including protein kinase C and MAP kinase, stimulate α-secretase. We present data to suggest that rivastigmine, in addition to anticholinesterase activity, directs APP processing away from BACE1 and towards α-secretases. We treated rat neuronal PC12 cells and primary human brain (PHB) cultures with rivastigmine and the α-secretase inhibitor TAPI and assayed for levels of APP processing products and α-secretases. We subsequently treated 3×Tg (transgenic) mice with rivastigmine and harvested hippocampi to assay for levels of APP processing products. We also assayed postmortem human control, AD, and AD brains from subjects treated with rivastigmine for levels of APP metabolites. Rivastigmine dose-dependently promoted α-secretase activity by upregulating levels of ADAM-9, -10, and -17 α-secretases in PHB cultures. Co-treatment with TAPI eliminated rivastigmine-induced sAPPα elevation. Rivastigmine treatment elevated levels of sAPPα in 3×Tg mice. Consistent with these results, we also found elevated sAPPα in postmortem brain samples from AD patients treated with rivastigmine. Rivastigmine can modify the levels of several shedding proteins and directs APP processing toward the non-amyloidogenic pathway. This novel property of rivastigmine can be therapeutically exploited for disease-modifying intervention that goes beyond symptomatic treatment for AD.","2158-3188","Translational psychiatry","(10) 47",2020,"Balmiki","Ray","B","Department of Psychiatry, Laboratory of Molecular Neurogenetics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, IN, 46202, USA."
32069773,"miRNA-31 Improves Cognition and Abolishes Amyloid-β Pathology by Targeting APP and BACE1 in an Animal Model of Alzheimer's Disease.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia worldwide, characterized by progressive memory impairment, behavioral changes, and, ultimately, loss of consciousness and death. Recently, microRNA (miRNA) dysfunction has been associated with increased production and impaired clearance of amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides, whose accumulation is one of the most well-known pathophysiological markers of this disease. In this study, we identified several miRNAs capable of targeting key proteins of the amyloidogenic pathway. The expression of one of these miRNAs, miR-31, previously found to be decreased in AD patients, was able to simultaneously reduce the levels of APP and Bace1 mRNA in the hippocampus of 17-month-old AD triple-transgenic (3xTg-AD) female mice, leading to a significant improvement of memory deficits and a reduction in anxiety and cognitive inflexibility. In addition, lentiviral-mediated miR-31 expression significantly ameliorated AD neuropathology in this model, drastically reducing Aβ deposition in both the hippocampus and subiculum. Furthermore, the increase of miR-31 levels was enough to reduce the accumulation of glutamate vesicles in the hippocampus to levels found in non-transgenic age-matched animals. Overall, our results suggest that miR-31-mediated modulation of APP and BACE1 can become a therapeutic option in the treatment of AD.","2162-2531","Molecular therapy.

32070713,"AdipoRon improves cognitive dysfunction of Alzheimer's disease and rescues impaired neural stem cell proliferation through AdipoR1/AMPK pathway.","Adult neurogenesis in hippocampus dentate gyrus (DG) is associated with the etiology on the early stage of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Factors that affect adult hippocampal neurogenesis have been shown to contribute to the neuropathology of AD. Adiponectin, a peptide hormone secreted by adipocytes, plays a critical role in insulin sensitizing, anti-inflammatory, and anti-diabetic effects in peripheral tissues. We previously showed that AdipoRon, as an agonist of adiponectin, promotes neurite outgrowth under ischemia. However, the role of AdipoRon on neural stem cells (NSCs) proliferation and cognitive dysfunction in the early stage of AD remains unknown. In this study, we investigated the role of AdipoRon on cognitive dysfunction and deficits of NSCs proliferation in AD. The in vivo study showed that AdipoRon improved either cognitive dysfunction or impaired NSCs proliferation in hippocampus DG region in APP/PS1 transgenic (Tg) mice. In addition, AdipoRon treatment also suppressed the β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition and inhibited β-secretase 1(BACE1) expression in both cortex and hippocampus of APP/PS1 Tg mice. The in vitro study further suggested that AdipoRon significantly alleviated Aβ-induced cell viability and neuronal morphology in primary neurons. Both AdipoR1 silencing and compound C, inhibitor of AMPK, completely abolished the effect of AdipoRon. Interestingly, AdipoRon also protected the dissipation of the ΔΨm caused by Aβ toxicity in primary neurons, which was reversed by compound C. In NE-4C NSCs, AdipoRon significantly promoted the Aβ-induced impaired cell proliferation through AdipoR1/AMPK/CREB pathway. Furthermore, inhibition of AMPK by compound C also reversed the promotive effects of AdipoRon on cognition and proliferation of NSCs of APP/PS1 Tg mice, suggesting a AMPK-dependent mechanism by AdipoRon in AD in vivo. Taken together, these results suggested that AdipoRon alleviated the cognitive dysfunction of AD mice, inhibited the Aβ deposition by inhibiting BACE1 expression and promoted the impaired hippocampal NSCs proliferation on the early stage in vivo. The mechanisms involved activation of AdipoR1/AMPK pathway. Therefore, AdipoRon might be a potential candidate for the treatment of AD on the early stage.","1090-2430","Experimental neurology","(327) 113249",2020,"Bin","Liu","B","Institute for Metabolic and Neuropsychiatric Disorders, Binzhou Medical University Hospital, Binzhou, China."

Increasing evidence suggested an association between sleep deprivation and AD. Our recent study found that chronic sleep restriction (CSR) caused cognitive impairment and Aβ accumulation in rats, but the underlining mechanism was unclear. In the present study, we investigated the effects of inflammation on Aβ accumulation induced by CSR. We found that CSR significantly increased the expression of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and nitric oxide (NO) in brain, and the inflammatory factors levels were positively correlated with Aβ42 deposition. Additionally, the inflammatory factors were correlated with BACE1, LRP-1, and RAGE levels in both the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex. Furthermore, the plasma levels of IL-1β, TNF-α, and NO were elevated after CSR, and the concentration of plasma inflammatory mediators were correlated with plasma levels of sLRP1 and sRAGE. These results suggested that the inflammation in brain and plasma might be involved in the CSR-induced Aβ accumulation.","1875-8908","Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD","(74) 759-773",2020,"Peng","Liu","P","Department of Neurology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China."

Acetyl-11-keto-β-boswellic acid (AKBA) is an active triterpenoid compound from extracts of Boswellia serrata, which has been widely used as an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent. The present study was to determine whether AKBA, a novel candidate, could protect against cognitive and neuropathological impairments in AD. We found that AKBA treatment resulted in a significant improvement of learning and memory deficits, a dramatic decrease in cerebral amyloid-β (Aβ) levels and plaque burden, a profound alleviation in oxidative stress and inflammation, and a marked reduction in activated glial cells and synaptic defects in the APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. Furthermore, amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing was remarkably suppressed with AKBA treatment by inhibiting beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) protein expression to produce Aβ in the APPswe/PS1dE9 mice brains. Mechanistically, AKBA modulated antioxidant and anti-inflammatory pathways via increasing nuclear erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) expression, and via declining phosphorylation of inhibitor of nuclear factor-kappa B alpha (IκBα) and p65.

Aquaporin 1 (AQP1) is a membrane water channel protein belonging to the AQP family. AQP1 levels are elevated in the cerebral cortex during the early stages of AD, but the role of AQP1 in AD pathogenesis is unclear. We first determined the expression and distribution of AQP1 in brain tissue samples of AD patients and two AD mouse models (3xTg-AD and 5xFAD). AQP1 accumulation was observed in vulnerable neurons in the cerebral cortex of AD patients, and in neurons affected by the Aβ or tau pathology in the 3xTg-AD and 5xFAD mice. AQP1 levels increased in neurons as aging progressed in the AD mouse models. Stress stimuli increased AQP1 in primary cortical neurons. In response to cellular stress, AQP1 appeared to translocate to endocytic compartments of β- and γ-secretase activities. Ectopic expression of AQP1 in human neuroblastoma cells overexpressing amyloid precussir protein (APP) with the Swedish mutations reduced β-secretase (BACE1)-mediated cleavage of APP and reduced Aβ production without altering the nonamyloidogenic pathway. Conversely, knockdown of AQP1 enhanced BACE1 activity and Aβ production. Immunoprecipitation experiments showed that AQP1 decreased the association of BACE1 with APP. Analysis of a human database showed that the amount of Aβ decreases as the expression of AQP1 increases. These results suggest that the upregulation of AQP1 is an adaptive response of neurons to stress that reduces Aβ production by inhibiting the binding between BACE1 and APP.","1758-535X","The journals of gerontology.

Our prior studies have shown that HAAs produce dopaminergic neurotoxicity. Given the mechanistic and pathological overlap between AD and dopaminergic disorders we investigated whether exposure to 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo [4,5-b] pyridine (PhIP), a prevalent dietary HAA formed during high-temperature meat cooking, may produce AD-relevant neurotoxicity. Here, C57BL/6 mice were treated with 100 or 200 mg/kg PhIP for 8 h or 75 mg/kg for 4 weeks and 16 weeks. PhIP exposure for 8 h produced oxidative damage, and AD-relevant alterations in hippocampal synaptic proteins, Amyloid-beta precursor protein (APP), and β-Site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1). PhIP exposure for 4 weeks resulted in an increase in BACE1. PhIP exposure for 16 weeks resulted in increased hippocampal oxidative damage, APP, BACE1, Aβ aggregation, and tau phosphorylation. Quantification of intracellular nitrotyrosine revealed oxidative damage in cholinergic neurons after 8 h, 4 weeks and 16 weeks of PhIP exposure. Our study demonstrates that increase in oxidative damage, APP and BACE1 might be a possible mechanism by which PhIP promotes Aβ aggregation. Given many patients with AD or PD exhibit neuropathological overlap, our study suggests that HAA exposure should be further studied for roles in mediating pathogenic overlap.","1879-3185","Toxicology","(437) 152436",2020,"Tauqeerunnisa","Syeda","T","School of Health Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, 47907, United States; Purdue Institute for Integrative Neurosciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, IN, 47907, United States."

A wealth of research has focused on finding highly selective small-molecule inhibitors targeting the BACE1 over its close homologue BACE2 to avoid potential side effects. However, given the highly structural similarities of BACE1 and BACE2, designing highly selective BACE1 inhibitors remains a huge challenge. Recently, it has been reported that a potential BACE1 inhibitor named C28 (∼52-fold selectivity) exhibited greater selectivity to BACE1 over BACE2 than the previously reported inhibitors AZD3293 and AZD3839 (∼1.5-fold and 14-fold selectivity). However, few computational studies have been performed to reveal its underlying mechanisms. In this study, a series of molecular modeling techniques were performed to reveal the selective mechanisms. Classical molecular dynamics (cMD) simulations indicated that the major variations appeared to be controlled by overall protein dynamics. Free energy calculations further suggested that the binding affinities of AZD3293 to BACE1 and BACE2 are similar, but the binding affinity of AZD3839 and C28 to BACE1 is much higher than to BACE2, and that the major variations are electrostatic interactions. The protein dynamics and energy differences were further observed in accelerated molecular dynamics (aMD) simulations. In addition, the umbrella sampling simulations revealed the inhibitors' different patterns of dissociation from the binding pockets of BACE1 and BACE2, and that different energy barriers were responsible for the selectivity.

These peptides are generated via proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein (APP), in a manner dependent on the β-secretase, BACE1 and the multicomponent γ-secretase complex. Recent data also suggest a contributory role in AD of transactive response DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43). There is little insight into a possible mechanism linking TDP-43 and APP processing. To this end, we used cultured human neuronal cells to investigate the ability of TDP-43 to interact with APP and modulate its proteolytic processing. Immunocytochemistry showed TDP-43 to be spatially segregated from both the extranuclear APP holoprotein and its nuclear C-terminal fragment. The latter (APP intracellular domain) was shown to predominantly localise to nucleoli, from which TDP-43 was excluded. Furthermore, neither overexpression of each of the APP isoforms nor siRNA-mediated knockdown of APP had any effect on TDP-43 expression. Doxycycline-stimulated overexpression of TDP-43 was explored in an inducible cell line. Overexpression of TDP-43 had no effect on expression of the APP holoprotein, nor any of the key proteins involved in its proteolysis. Furthermore, increased TDP-43 expression had no effect on BACE1 enzymatic activity or immunoreactivity of Aβ1-40, Aβ1-42 or the Aβ1-40:Aβ1-42 ratio. Also, siRNA-mediated knockdown of TDP-43 had no effect on BACE1 immunoreactivity.

Although there are therapeutics that are being used in contemporary medicine for treatment against Alzheimer's disease, new and more effective drugs are in great demand. In this work, we proposed three potential drug candidates which may act as multifunctional compounds simultaneously toward AChE, SERT, BACE1 and GSK3β protein targets. These candidates were discovered by using state-of-the-art methods as molecular calculations (molecular docking and molecular dynamics), artificial neural networks and multilinear regression models. These methods were used for virtual screening of the publicly available library containing more than twenty thousand compounds. The experimental testing enabled us to confirm a multitarget drug candidate active at low micromolar concentrations against two targets, e.g., AChE and BACE1.","1420-3049","Molecules (Basel, Switzerland)","E1846",2020,"Larisa","Ivanova","L","Department of Chemistry, University of Tartu, Ravila 14a, 50411 Tartu, Estonia."
32323475,"AP-2 reduces amyloidogenesis by promoting BACE1 trafficking and degradation in neurons.","Cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by BACE-1 (β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1) is the rate-limiting step in amyloid-β (Aβ) production and a neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Despite decades of research, mechanisms of amyloidogenic APP processing remain highly controversial. Here, we show that in neurons, APP processing and Aβ production are controlled by the protein complex-2 (AP-2), an endocytic adaptor known to be required for APP endocytosis. Now, we find that AP-2 prevents amyloidogenesis by additionally functioning downstream of BACE1 endocytosis, regulating BACE1 endosomal trafficking and its delivery to lysosomes. AP-2 is decreased in iPSC-derived neurons from patients with late-onset AD, while conditional AP-2 knockout (KO) mice exhibit increased Aβ production, resulting from accumulation of BACE1 within late endosomes and autophagosomes. Deletion of BACE1 decreases amyloidogenesis and mitigates synapse loss in neurons lacking AP-2. Taken together, these data suggest a mechanism for BACE1 intracellular trafficking and degradation via an endocytosis-independent function of AP-2 and reveal a novel role for endocytic proteins in AD.","1469-3178","EMBO reports","(21) e47954",2020,"Sujoy","Bera","S","CECAD Research Center, University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany."

Moreover, in the last years, major pharmaceutical companies have discontinued clinical trials of five BACE1 inhibitors that had been strongly perceived as prospective. In our review, the Aβ hypothesis, the enzyme, its functions, and selected substrates are described. BACE1 inhibitors are classified into four generations. Those that underwent clinical trials displayed adverse effects, including weight loss, skin rashes, worsening of neuropsychiatric symptoms, etc. Some inhibitors could not establish a statistically significant risk-benefit ratio, or even scored worse than placebo.

The aim of the present study was to determine whether the measurement of plasma exosomal lncRNA combined with image data of the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus could be used as a biomarker of AD. A total of 72 patients with AD and 62 controls were recruited, and the expression levels of several lncRNAs were assessed. Of the recruited participants, 22 patients and 26 controls received brain 3D‑BRAVO sequence magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, which were analyzed using an automated analysis tool. The plasma exosomal β‑site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme‑1‑antisense transcript (BACE1‑AS) levels in patients with AD were significantly higher compared with the controls (P<0.005). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.761 for BACE1‑AS, the sensitivity was 87.5%, and the specificity was 61.3%. Analysis of MRI images indicated that the right entorhinal cortex volume (P=0.015) and thickness (P=0.022) in patients with AD were significantly smaller. The AUC was 0.688 for the right entorhinal cortex volume, with a sensitivity of 59.1%, and the specificity was 84.6%. The AUC was 0.689 for right entorhinal cortex thickness, with a sensitivity of 80.8%, and the specificity was 59.1%. A series‑parallel test which integrated the BACE1‑AS with the right entorhinal cortex volume and thickness, raised the specificity and sensitivity to 96.15 and 90.91%, respectively. A logistic regression model demonstrated that combination of the 3 indices provided improved sensitivity and specificity simultaneously, particularly when adjusting for age and sex (AUC, 0.819; sensitivity, 81%; specificity, 73.1%).

In this study we investigated the influence of G. delavayi flower extract on amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing at molecular and cellular levels. APP/PS1 Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were treated with chloroform extract of G. delavayi flower in different concentrations for 24 h. Concentrations of amyloid β (Aβ) 40 and Aβ42 in the cell supernatant and activity of β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), BACE2, and cathepsin D were determined. The expression of APP and neprilysin (NEP) within the cell were further determined. Compared with the control group, the levels of Aβ40 and Aβ42 declined notably and the activity of BACE1 was inhibited significantly in the APP/PS1 CHO cells after treatment with the chloroform extract of G. delavayi flower. Although the activities of BACE2 and cathepsin D were not changed, the expression of Aβ degrading enzyme NEP increased remarkably. Our experiments have clearly showed that the chloroform extract of G. delavayi flower inhibits the generation of β-amyloid by specifically inhibiting β-secretase and increases the expression of NEP which fastens the degradation of Aβ, exhibiting the effect of decreasing Aβ accumulation in APP/PS1 CHO cells.

However, the causal relationship between obesity and diabetes, increased Aβ, and vascular dysfunction is unclear. We report that diet-induced obesity (DIO) in mice increased plasma and vascular Aβ42 that correlated with decreased NO bioavailability, endothelial dysfunction, and increased blood pressure. Genetic or pharmacological reduction of BACE1 activity and Aβ42 prevented and reversed, respectively, these outcomes. In contrast, expression of human mutant APP in mice or Aβ42 infusion into control diet-fed mice to mimic obese levels impaired NO production, vascular relaxation, and raised blood pressure. In humans, increased plasma Aβ42 correlated with diabetes and endothelial dysfunction. Mechanistically, higher Aβ42 reduced endothelial NO synthase (eNOS), cyclic GMP (cGMP), and protein kinase G (PKG) activity independently of diet, whereas endothelin-1 was increased by diet and Aβ42. Lowering Aβ42 reversed the DIO deficit in the eNOS/cGMP/PKG pathway and decreased endothelin-1.

32425755,"Opposite Roles of δ- and μ-Opioid Receptors in BACE1 Regulation and Alzheimer's Injury.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Substantial evidence for AD pathogenesis suggests that β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and γ-secretase enzyme initiate the amyloidogenic pathway and produces toxic Aβ peptides that prone to aggregate in the brain. Therefore, the inhibition of BACE1 expression and function is an attractive strategy for AD therapy. In the present work, we made the first finding that activating δ-opioid receptors (DOR) with a specific DOR agonist significantly attenuated BACE1 expression and activity in the highly differentiated PC12 cells with mimicked AD injury, while the application of DOR inhibitor naltrindole reversed the UFP-512 effects, and even caused a major increase in BACE1 expression and activity as well as Aβ42 production in physiological conditions. Knocking-down DOR also enhanced BACE1 protein expression and its activity for APP processing, associating with a significant increase in Aβ42 production. In sharp contrast, activation of μ-opioid receptor (MOR) with DAMGO greatly promoted BACE1 expression and activity with an acceleration of APP cleavage, thus contributing to increased Aβ42 production. DADLE, a less selective DOR agonist that may bind to MOR, had no stable inhibitory effect on BACE1. Similar results were also found in APP mutant (APPswe) SH-SY5Y cell line, providing further validation of the DOR action on BACE1 regulation. Our novel data demonstrated entirely different roles of DOR and MOR in the regulation of BACE1 expression and activity with DOR being neuroprotective against AD injury. These findings provided a novel clue for new strategies of AD therapy via targeting endogenous opioid receptors.","1662-5102","Frontiers in cellular neuroscience","(14) 88",2020,"Yuan","Xu","Y","Shanghai Key Laboratory of Acupuncture Mechanism and Acupoint Function, Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."

Deep insight into inhibitor-BACE1 binding mechanism is of significance for design of potent drugs toward BACE1. In this work, multiple replica accelerated molecular dynamics (MR-aMD) simulations, principal component (PC) analysis, and free energy landscapes were integrated to decode the effect of disulfide bonds (SSBs) in BACE1 on bindings of three inhibitors 3KO, 3KT, and 779 to BACE1. The results from cross-correlation analysis suggest that the breaking of SSBs exerts significant influence on structural flexibility and internal dynamics of inhibitor-bound BACE1. PC analysis and free energy landscapes reveal that the breaking of SSBs not only evidently induces the conformational rearrangement of BACE1 but also highly changes binding poses of three inhibitors in BACE1 and leads to more disordered binding of three inhibitors to BACE1, which is further supported by the increase in binding entropy of inhibitors to BACE1 due to the breaking of SSBs. Residue-based free energy decomposition method was utilized to evaluate contributions of separate residues to inhibitor-BACE1 binding. The results suggest that although the breaking of SSBs in BACE1 does not destroy the interaction network of inhibitors with BACE1 it changes interaction strength of some residues with inhibitors. Meanwhile, the information from residue-based free energy decomposition indicates that residues L91, S96, V130, Y132, Q134, W137, F169, I171, and I179 can be used as efficient targets of drug design toward BACE1.","1948-7193","ACS chemical neuroscience","(11) 1811-1826",2020,"Jianzhong","Chen","J","School of Science, Shandong Jiaotong University, Jinan 250357, China."

A novel compound was eventually detected and named Dip-1, and its pharmacological properties were predicted using computational modelling. The compound was found to have pharmacophores similar to those of known BACE1 inhibitors. Thus, further studies were performed to determine its drug likeness, blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, inhibitory potential and IC50 value. The results were promising, and the compound was found to have high drug likeness and BBB permeability, and a potent inhibitor of BACE1, with IC50 value of 0.0372 nM. Thus, the present study reports a novel BACE1 inhibitor from the plant D. wallichii, and is significant owing to its therapeutic implication as a disease-modifying therapy for AD.","1532-2777","Medical hypotheses","(143) 109839",2020,"Pankaj","Chetia","P","Department of Life Sciences, Dibrugarh University, Dibrugarh 786004, Assam, India; Department of Life Science & Bioinformatics, Assam University, Silchar 788011, Assam, India.

We found that BACE1 was expressed in the rat carotid body and located in the nerve endings and type II cells but not in type I cells. CIH reduced BACE1 level in the carotid body, and reoxygenation or ROS scavenger alleviated this reduction. Furthermore, we found that CIH augmented the mRNA level of PGC-1α but attenuated the mRNA level of BACE1 in the carotid body. Taken together, our results suggest that CIH promotes the production of ROS that upregulates the level of PGC-1α, which may in turn inhibits the transcription of BACE1, and that a reduction in the BACE1 level may be related to CIH-induced reversible and ROS-dependent carotid body plasticity.

Obesity results in the gut microbiota dysbiosis, which includes butyrate-producing bacteria are reduced. Although sodium butyrate (NaB) has emerged as the potential therapeutic substance in AD, there is a lack of detailed results into what signaling pathways affect amyloidogenesis in AD induced by obesity. Thus, we investigated the regulatory role of NaB on amyloidogenesis in neuronal cells under high cholesterol. In our results, we verified that increased amyloid β peptide (Aβ) accumulation in the brain of obese mice and a reduction in butyrate-producing bacteria due to the gut microbiota dysbiosis induced by obesity. We showed that NaB decreased the expression levels of beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and Aβ accumulation induced by high cholesterol in SK-N-MC cells. We demonstrated that NaB was absorbed in cells through sodium-coupled monocarboxylate transporter 1 (SMCT1) and then inhibited high cholesterol-induced Aβ accumulation. Subsequently, we also observed that reactive oxygen species (ROS) were overproduced because of increased NADPH oxidase 2 (NOX2) expression under high cholesterol. Meanwhile, NaB decreased NOX2 levels through a reduction of NF-κB activity, which ultimately inhibited Aβ accumulation caused by high cholesterol. We demonstrated that NaB increased the expression levels of p21 under high cholesterol, contributing to p21/NRF2 (Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2) colocalization, which leads to NRF2 stabilization. NRF2 stabilization causes NF-κB inactivation, followed by NOX2 suppression and superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) upregulation. Thus, NaB with SOD1 silencing under high cholesterol did not eliminate excessive ROS, and eventually resulted in Aβ accumulation. In conclusion, we demonstrated that NaB prevents excessive ROS through NOX2 suppression and SOD1 upregulation by p21/NRF2 pathway, which is critical for inhibiting BACE1-dependent amyloidogenesis in neuronal cells exposed to high cholesterol environment.","2041-4889","Cell death & disease","(11) 469",2020,"Seo Yihl","Kim","SY","Department of Veterinary Physiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Research Institute for Veterinary Science, and BK21 PLUS Program for Creative Veterinary Science Research, Seoul National University, Seoul, 08826, Republic of Korea."

Among the several secretases involved in the generation of Aβ, β-secretase (BACE1) is the first rate-limiting enzyme in Aβ production that can be utilized to prevent the development of Aβ-related pathologies. Cinnamon extract, used in traditional medicine, was shown to inhibit the aggregation of tau protein and Aβ aggregation. However, the effect of trans-cinnamaldehyde (TCA), the main component of cinnamon, on Aβ deposition is unknown. Five-month-old 5XFAD mice were treated with TCA for eight weeks. Seven-month-old 5XFAD mice were evaluated for cognitive and spatial memory function. Brain samples collected at the conclusion of the treatment were assessed by immunofluorescence and biochemical analyses. Additional in vivo experiments were conducted to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the effect of TCA in the role of Aβ deposition. TCA treatment led to improvements in cognitive impairment and reduced Aβ deposition in the brains of 5XFAD mice. Interestingly, the levels of BACE1 were decreased, whereas the mRNA and protein levels of three well-known regulators of BACE1, silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPARγ) coactivator 1α (PGC1α), and PPARγ, were increased in TCA-treated 5XFAD mice.

We report AD-like pathology in cerebral organoids grown in vitro from non-invasively sampled strands of hair from 71% of DS donors. The pathology consisted of extracellular diffuse and fibrillar Aβ deposits, hyperphosphorylated/pathologically conformed Tau, and premature neuronal loss. Presence/absence of AD-like pathology was donor-specific (reproducible between individual organoids/iPSC lines/experiments). Pathology could be triggered in pathology-negative T21 organoids by CRISPR/Cas9-mediated elimination of the third copy of chromosome 21 gene BACE2, but prevented by combined chemical β and γ-secretase inhibition. We found that T21 organoids secrete increased proportions of Aβ-preventing (Aβ1-19) and Aβ-degradation products (Aβ1-20 and Aβ1-34). We show these profiles mirror in cerebrospinal fluid of people with DS. We demonstrate that this protective mechanism is mediated by BACE2-trisomy and cross-inhibited by clinically trialled BACE1 inhibitors. Combined, our data prove the physiological role of BACE2 as a dose-sensitive AD-suppressor gene, potentially explaining the dementia delay in ~30% of people with DS.

As a possible treatment for AD, we developed an epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) and β-site amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleaving enzyme 1 antisense (BACE1-AS) shRNA-encoded plasmid. The plasmid was loaded on to RVG29 peptide-targeted multifunctional nanoparticles (NPs) (REGS-PN). The polymeric NPs were characterized by flow cytometry, biocompatibility assay, pharmacokinetic analysis, Western blot analysis, and the Morris water maze (MWM) test. The differences in plasma and brain NP accumulation following intravenous administration showed a significantly longer circulation time for EGS-PN and REGS-PN in the blood stream. In contrast, free EGCG was rapidly eliminated from the circulation. REGS-PM successfully travelled through the blood-brain barrier and was present at a higher concentration in the brain compared with both non-targeted NPs and free EGCG. REGS-PN administration to APPswe/PS1dE9 double transgenic mice (APP/PS1 mice) resulted in downregulation of the key enzyme in amyloid-β formation (BACE1) and amyloid beta, indicating synergistic therapeutic activity. The MWM test revealed that simultaneous delivery of a therapeutic gene and EGCG (REGS-PN) remarkably improved the spatial learning and memory capabilities of APP/PS1 mice as well as wild type mice compared with the free EGCG-treated group.

A variety of therapies that are currently under development are directed to the amyloid cascade. Indeed, the accumulation and toxicity of amyloid-β (Aβ) is believed to play a central role in the etiology of the disease, and thus rational interventions are aimed at reducing the levels of Aβ in the brain. Targeting β-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme (BACE)-1 represents an attractive strategy, as this enzyme catalyzes the initial and rate-limiting step in Aβ production. Observation of increased levels of BACE1 and enzymatic activity in the brain, cerebrospinal fluid, and platelets of patients with AD and mild cognitive impairment supports the potential benefits of BACE1 inhibition. Numerous potent inhibitors have been generated, and many of these have been proved to lower Aβ levels in the brain of animal models. Over 10 years of intensive research on BACE1 inhibitors has now culminated in advancing half a dozen of these drugs into human trials, yet translating the in vitro and cellular efficacy of BACE1 inhibitors into preclinical and clinical trials represents a challenge.

32670015,"Pulse Pressure: An Emerging Therapeutic Target for Dementia.","Elevated pulse pressure can cause blood-brain barrier dysfunction and subsequent adverse neurological changes that may drive or contribute to the development of dementia with age. In short, elevated pulse pressure dysregulates cerebral endothelial cells and increases cellular production of oxidative and inflammatory molecules. The resulting cerebral microvascular damage, along with excessive pulsatile mechanical force, can induce breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, which in turn triggers brain cell impairment and death. We speculate that elevated pulse pressure may also reduce the efficacy of other therapeutic strategies for dementia. For instance, BACE1 inhibitors and anti-amyloid-β biologics reduce amyloid-β deposits in the brain that are thought to be a cause of Alzheimer's disease, the most prevalent form of dementia. However, upregulation of oxidative and inflammatory molecules and increased amyloid-β secretion by cerebral endothelial cells exposed to elevated pulse pressure may hinder cognitive improvements with these drugs. Additionally, stem or progenitor cell therapy has the potential to repair blood-brain barrier damage, but chronic oxidative and inflammatory stress due to elevated pulse pressure can inhibit stem and progenitor cell regeneration. Finally, we discuss current efforts to repurpose blood pressure medications to prevent or treat dementia. We propose that new drugs or devices should be developed to safely reduce elevated pulse pressure specifically to the brain. Such novel technologies may alleviate an entire downstream pathway of cellular dysfunction, oxidation, inflammation, and amyloidogenesis, thereby preventing pulse-pressure-induced cognitive decline. Furthermore, these technologies may also enhance efficacy of other dementia therapeutics when used in combination.","1662-4548","Frontiers in neuroscience","(14) 669",2020,"Rachel A","Levin","RA","The Brain Protection Company, Sydney, NSW, Australia."

In this study RT-qPCR was used to determine the expression of miR-107 in CVB3-infected and uninfected HeLa cells. The experimental results show that the level of miR-107 began to rise at 4 h after the infection, and significantly boosted at 6 h. Based on the results of this experiment, we consider that miR-107 expression is related to CVB3 infection. In order to further clarify the effect of miR-107 in the process of CVB3 infection, we studied the effect of miR-107 upstream and downstream target genes on CVB3 replication. Levels of the target RNAs were detected by RT-qPCR after CVB3 infection, and the expression of CVB3 capsid protein VP1 by western blot analysis. Then the virus in the supernatant was quantitated via a viral plaque assay, reflecting the release of the virus. The experimental results showed that miRNA-107 expression is associated with CVB3 replication and proliferation, while KLF4 and BACE1 as the downstream of miR-107 weakened CVB3 replication. Overexpressions of KLF4 and BACE1 negatively regulated CVB3 replication, this effect on CVB3 was completely opposite to that of miR-107.

Importantly, BACE1-AS acted as a sponge for miR-214-3p. Additionally, miR-214-3p silencing reversed the influence of BACE1-AS knockdown on isoflurane-mediated proliferation, apoptosis and autophagy in Aβ-induced SK-N-SH and SK-N-AS cells. In conclusion, BACE1-AS aggravated isoflurane-induced neurotoxicity to AD via sponging miR-214-3p.","1573-6903","Neurochemical research","(45) 2324-2335",2020,"Wei","He","W","Department of Anesthesiology, The Affiliated Hospital of Beihua University, No. 12 Jiefang Middle Road, Chuanying District, Jilin City, 132001, Jilin Province, China."
32681467,"Pathogenesis and promising therapeutics of Alzheimer disease through eIF2α pathway and correspondent kinases.","Eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2α) pathway is overactivated in Alzheimer disease and is probably associated with synaptic and memory deficiencies. EIF2α protein is principally in charge of the regulation of protein synthesis in eukaryotic cells. Four kinases responsible for eIF2α phosphorylation at ser-51 are: General control non-derepressible-2 kinase (GCN2), double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR), PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), and heme-regulated inhibitor kinase (HRI) are the four kinases. They lead to reduced levels of general translation and paradoxical increase of stress-responsive mRNAs expression including the B-secretase (BACE1) and the transcriptional modulator activating transcription factor 4 (ATF4), which in turn accelerates the beta-amyloidogenesis, tau phosphorylation, proapoptotic pathway induction and autophagy elements formation leading to the main pathological hallmarks of AD. Findings suggest that genetic or pharmacological inhibition of correspondent kinases can restore memory and prevent neurodegeneration. This implies that inhibition of eIF2α phosphorylation through respondent kinases is indeed a feasible prospect of clinical application. This review discusses recent therapeutic approaches targeting eIF2α pathway and provides an overview of the links between correspondent kinases overactivation with neurodegeneration in AD.","1573-7365","Metabolic brain disease","(35) 1241-1250",2020,"Reza","Moradi Majd","R","Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Islamic Republic of Iran."

Accumulating evidence revealed the role of SIRT2 in a wide range of biological processes and age-related diseases. However, the pivotal mechanism of SIRT2 played in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unknown. Here, we report that pharmacological inactivation of SIRT2 has a beneficial effect in AD. The deacetylase inhibitor of SIRT2 rescued the cognitive impairment in amyloid precursor protein/presenilin 1 transgenic mouse (APP/PS1 mouse), and the BACE1 cleavage was weakened to reduce the β-amyloid (Aβ) production in the hippocampus. Moreover, we firstly identified that Reticulon 4B (RTN4B) played a crucial role between SIRT2/BACE1 regulation in AD. RTN4B, as a deacetylation substrate for SIRT2, the deacetylation by SIRT2 drived the ubiquitination and degradation of RTN4B and then the disturbed RTN4B interacted with and influenced the expression of BACE1. When we overexpressed RTN4B in neurons of the hippocampus in the AD mouse model, the abnormal Aβ accumulation and cognitive impairment were ameliorated, consistent with the results of SIRT2 inhibition in vivo. Moreover, we showed that the regulatory effect of SIRT2 on BACE1 is dependent on RTN4B. When RTN4B was knocked down, the effects of SIRT2 inhibition on the BACE1 level, Aβ pathology, and AD-liked behaviors were also blocked. Collectively, we provide evidence that SIRT2 may be a potential target for AD; the new found SIRT2/RTN4B/BACE1 pathological pathway is one of the critical mechanisms for the improvement of SIRT2 on AD.","1474-9726","Aging cell","(19) e13194",2020,"Yan","Wang","Y","Key Laboratory of Biomedical Information Engineering of Ministry of Education, Biomedical Informatics & Genomics Center, School of Life Science and Technology, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an, China."

Regulation of mitochondrial calcium influx from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is considered a promising strategy for the prevention of mitochondrial ROS (mtROS) accumulation that occurs in the Alzheimer's disease (AD)-associated pathogenesis in DM patients. Among the metabolites of ellagitannins that are produced in the gut microbiome, urolithin A has received an increasing amount of attention as a novel candidate with anti-oxidative and neuroprotective effects in AD. Here, we investigated the effect of urolithin A on high glucose-induced amyloidogenesis caused by mitochondrial calcium dysregulation and mtROS accumulation resulting in neuronal degeneration. We also identified the mechanism related to mitochondria-associated ER membrane (MAM) formation. We found that urolithin A-lowered mitochondrial calcium influx significantly alleviated high glucose-induced mtROS accumulation and expression of amyloid beta (Aβ)-producing enzymes, such as amyloid precursor protein (APP) and β-secretase-1 (BACE1), as well as Aβ production. Urolithin A injections in a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mouse model alleviated APP and BACE1 expressions, Tau phosphorylation, Aβ deposition, and cognitive impairment. In addition, high glucose stimulated MAM formation and transglutaminase type 2 (TGM2) expression. We first discovered that urolithin A significantly reduced high glucose-induced TGM2 expression. In addition, disruption of the AIP-AhR complex was involved in urolithin A-mediated suppression of high glucose-induced TGM2 expression. Markedly, TGM2 silencing inhibited inositol 1, 4, 5-trisphosphate receptor type 1 (IP3R1)-voltage-dependent anion-selective channel protein 1 (VDAC1) interactions and prevented high glucose-induced mitochondrial calcium influx and mtROS accumulation. We also found that urolithin A or TGM2 silencing prevented Aβ-induced mitochondrial calcium influx, mtROS accumulation, Tau phosphorylation, and cell death in neuronal cells. In conclusion, we suggest that urolithin A is a promising candidate for the development of therapies to prevent DM-associated AD pathogenesis by reducing TGM2-dependent MAM formation and maintaining mitochondrial calcium and ROS homeostasis.","1476-5403","Cell death and differentiation","(28) 184-202",2021,"Hyun Jik","Lee","HJ","Laboratory of Veterinary Physiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Chungbuk National University, Cheongju, Chungbuk, 28644, South Korea."

We argue that a growing list of noncognitive mental impairments related to pharmacological modulation of BACE1 might present a major obstacle in clinical translation of emerging therapeutic leads targeting this protease. The adverse effects of BACE1 inhibition on mental health call for a revision of treatment strategies that assume indiscriminate inhibition of this key protease, and stress the need for further mechanistic and translational studies.","1089-4098","The Neuroscientist : a review journal bringing neurobiology, neurology and psychiatry","(27) 222-234",2021,"Saak V","Ovsepian","SV","National Institute of Mental Health, Klecany, Czech Republic."

Since the first mutations in the PSEN1 gene were discovered more than 25 years ago, many postulated functions of PS1 have been investigated. The majority of earlier studies focused on its role as the catalytic component of the γ-secretase complex, which in concert with β site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), mediates the formation of Aβ from amyloid-β protein precursor (AβPP). Though mutant PS1 was originally considered to cause AD by promoting Aβ pathology through its protease function, it is now becoming clear that PS1 is a multifunctional protein involved in regulating membrane dynamics and protein trafficking. Therefore, through loss of these abilities, mutant PS1 has the potential to impair numerous cellular functions such as calcium flux, organization of proteins in different compartments, and protein turnover via vacuolar metabolism. Impaired calcium signaling, vacuolar dysfunction, mitochondrial dysfunction, and increased ER stress, among other related membrane-dependent disturbances, have been considered critical to the development and progression of AD. Given that PS1 plays a key regulatory role in all these processes, this review will describe the role of PS1 in different cellular compartments and provide an integrated view of how PS1 dysregulation (due to mutations or other causes) could result in impairment of various cellular processes and result in a ""multi-hit"", integrated pathological outcome that could contribute to the etiology of AD.","1875-8908","Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD","(77) 961-977",2020,"Carol A","Deaton","CA","Cell Biology of Disease Program and the Department of Anesthesiology and Perioperative Medicine, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY, USA."

In this study, we aimed to explore the function and mechanism of FoxO1 in amyloid-β (Aβ) production and tau phosphorylation in AD. First, compared with the age matched wild-type (WT) mice, we showed that FoxO1 protein levels were reduced in the cortices but nearly unchanged in the hippocampi of 6-month-old APPswe/PSEN1dE9 transgenic mice expressing Swedish APP and Presenilin1 delta exon 9 mutations (APP/PS1 mice). Then, we found that overexpression of FoxO1 significantly attenuated Aβ production through inhibiting the amyloidogenic processing of β-amyloid precursor protein (APP), mediated by the key enzymes BACE1 and PS1, in N2a/APPsw cells. Furthermore, in FoxO1-overexpressing HEK293/Tau cells, the decreased levels of tau phosphorylation at selective sites (S262 and T231) were accompanied by increasing the expression of p-GSK-3β (S9), and reducing p-ERK. In contrast, the total tau (Tau-5), non-phosphorylated tau (Tau-1), p-Tau (S404), CDK5 and PP2A levels remained unchanged.

Biomarkers suggest that the earliest event in AD is a decrease of cerebral blood flow (CBF). This is caused by constriction of capillaries by contractile pericytes, probably evoked by oligomeric Aβ. CBF is also reduced by neutrophil trapping in capillaries and clot formation, perhaps secondary to the capillary constriction. The fall in CBF potentiates neurodegeneration by upregulating the BACE1 enzyme that makes Aβ and by promoting tau hyperphosphorylation. Surprisingly, therefore, CBF reduction may play a crucial role in driving cognitive decline by initiating the amyloid cascade itself, or being caused by and amplifying Aβ production. Here, we review developments in this area that are neglected in current approaches to AD, with the aim of promoting novel mechanism-based therapeutic approaches.","1432-0533","Acta neuropathologica","(140) 793-810",2020,"Nils","Korte","N","Department of Neuroscience, Physiology and Pharmacology, University College London, Gower Street, London, WC1E 6BT, UK."

Diagnostic accuracy was 77% for LOAD, 83% for VAD, and 77% for MIXED dementia.

Tau becomes hyperphosphorylated and disengages from MTs in AD, with evidence of resulting MT structure/function defects. Brain-penetrant MT-stabilizing compounds can normalize MTs and axonal transport in mouse models with tau pathology, thereby reducing neuron loss and decreasing tau pathology. MT dysfunction is also observed in dystrophic axons adjacent to Aβ plaques, resulting in accumulation of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and BACE1 with the potential for enhanced localized Aβ generation. We have examined whether the brain-penetrant MT-stabilizing compound CNDR-51657 might decrease plaque-associated axonal dystrophy and Aβ release in 5XFAD mice that develop an abundance of Aβ plaques. Administration of CNDR-51657 to 1.5-month-old male and female 5XFAD mice for 4 or 7 weeks led to decreased soluble brain Aβ that coincided with reduced APP and BACE1 levels, resulting in decreased formation of insoluble Aβ deposits. These data suggest a vicious cycle whereby initial Aβ plaque formation causes MT disruption in nearby axons, resulting in the local accumulation of APP and BACE1 that facilitates additional Aβ generation and plaque deposition. The ability of a MT-stabilizing compound to attenuate this cycle, and also reduce deficits resulting from reduced tau binding to MTs, suggests that molecules of this type hold promise as potential AD therapeutics.","1552-5279","Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association","(16) 1345-1357",2020,"Yuemang","Yao","Y","Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."

It has long been recognized that mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress contribute to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). We hypothesized that mitochondrial TXN2 might play a role in AD-like pathology. In this study, we found that in SH-SY5Y and HEK cells stably express full-length human amyloid-β precursor protein (HEK-APP), TXN2 silencing or over-expression selectively increased or decreased the transcription of beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), respectively, without altering the protein levels of others enzymes involved in the catalytic processing of APP. As a result, β-amyloid protein (Aβ) levels were significantly decreased by TXN2. In addition, in cells treated with 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP) that is known to increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) and promote mitochondrial dysfunction, TXN2 silencing resulted in further enhancement of BACE1 protein levels, suggesting a role of TXN2 in ROS removal. The downstream signaling might involve NFκB, as TXN2 reduced the phosphorylation of p65 and IκBα; and p65 knockdown significantly attenuated TXN2-mediated regulation of BACE1. Concomitantly, the levels of cellular ROS, apoptosis-related proteins and cell viability were altered by TXN2 silencing or over-expression. In APPswe/PS1E9 mice, an animal model of AD, the cortical and hippocampal TXN2 protein levels were decreased at 12 months but not at 6 months, suggesting an age-dependent decline.

The expression levels of miR-146a, miR-9, NF-κB, and NF-κB-related downstream genes, including TNF-α, BACE1, AβPP, Bax, and Bcl-2 were measured using quantitative real-time PCR. To determine the NF-κB activity, immunohistochemical expression of NF-κB/p65 phosphorylation was employed.

Results indicate that diabetes significantly upregulated the expression levels of miR-146a, miR-9, TNF-α, NF-κB, and subsequently AβPP, BACE1, and Bax. Expression analysis shows that QCSPIONs are more effective than pure QC in reducing the expression of miR-9. Interestingly, QCSPIONs reduce the pathological activity of NF-κB and subsequently normalize BACE1, AβPP, and the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2 expression better than pure QC. Comparative docking analyses also show the stronger binding affinity of QC to IKK and BACE1 proteins compared to specific inhibitors of each protein.

32949964,"Combined MD/QTAIM techniques to evaluate ligand-receptor interactions. Scope and limitations.","In medicinal chemistry, it is extremely important to evaluate, as accurately as possible, the molecular interactions involved in the formation of different ligand-receptor (L-R) complexes. Evaluating the different molecular interactions by quantum mechanics calculations is not a simple task, since formation of an L-R complex is a dynamic process. In this case, the use of combined techniques of molecular dynamics (MD) and quantum calculations is one the best possible approaches. In this work we report a comparative study using combined MD and QTAIM (Quantum Theory of Atoms In Molecules) calculations for five biological systems with different levels of structural complexity. We have studied Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), D2 Dopamine Receptor (D2DR), beta Secretase (BACE1), Dihydrofolate Reductase (DHFR) and Sphingosine Kinase 1 (SphK1). In these molecular targets, we have analyzed different ligands with diverse structural characteristics. The inhibitory activities of most of them have been previously measured in our laboratory. Our results indicate that QTAIM calculations can be extremely useful for in silico studies. It is possible to obtain very accurate information about the strength of the molecular interactions that stabilize the formation of the different L-R complexes. Better correlations can be obtained between theoretical and experimental data by using QTAIM calculations, allowing us to discriminate among ligands with similar affinities. QTAIM analysis gives fairly accurate information for weak interactions which are not well described by MD simulations. QTAIM study also allowed us to evaluate and determine which parts of the ligand need to be modified in order to increase its interactions with the molecular target. In this study we have discussed the importance of combined MD/QTAIM calculations for this type of simulations, showing their scopes and limitations.","1768-3254","European journal of medicinal chemistry","(208) 112792",2020,"Sebastián","Rojas","S","IMIBIO-SL CONICET, Facultad de Química, Bioquímica y Farmacia, Universidad Nacional de San Luis, Ejército de Los Andes 950, 5700, San Luis, Argentina."

To demonstrate its broad utility, hiSPECS was used to identify the secretory response of brain slices upon LPS-induced neuroinflammation and to establish the cell type-resolved mouse brain secretome resource using primary astrocytes, microglia, neurons, and oligodendrocytes. This resource allowed mapping the cellular origin of CSF proteins and revealed that an unexpectedly high number of secreted proteins in vitro and in vivo are proteolytically cleaved membrane protein ectodomains. Two examples are neuronally secreted ADAM22 and CD200, which we identified as substrates of the Alzheimer-linked protease BACE1. hiSPECS and the brain secretome resource can be widely exploited to systematically study protein secretion and brain function and to identify cell type-specific biomarkers for CNS diseases.","1460-2075","The EMBO journal","(39) e105693",2020,"Johanna","Tüshaus","J","German Center for Neurodegenerative Diseases (DZNE), Munich, Germany."

Previous works reported that the deficiency of PGRN accelerates β-amyloid (Aβ) accumulation in AD transgenic mouse brains while overexpression of PGRN could restrain disease progression. However, mechanisms of PGRN in protecting against Aβ deposition remains unclear. Here, using the 5xFAD AD mouse model, we show that intrahippocampal injection of PGRN protein leads to a reduction of Aβ plaques, downregulation of beta-secretase 1 (BACE1), and enhanced microglia Aβ phagocytosis in the mouse hippocampus. Furthermore, PGRN treatment inhibited BACE1 expression in N2a cells and primary culture neurons and improved the phagocytic capacity of microglia isolated from 5xFAD mouse brains.

32973937,"miR-149-5p inhibition reduces Alzheimer's disease β-amyloid generation in 293/APPsw cells by upregulating H4K16ac via KAT8.","Alzheimer's disease (AD), the leading cause of age-related dementia, is characterized by abnormal β-amyloid accumulation. During learning, memory formation and consolidation, increased levels of histone H3 and H4 acetylation are observed. The present study reported significantly decreased level of H4K16ac in the plasma of patients with AD compared with healthy subjects via western blotting and reverse transcription-quantitative (RT-q)PCR. Lysine acetyltransferase 8 (KAT8) expression, the major lysine acetyltransferase responsible for the acetylation of H4K16, was significantly decreased in patients with AD compared with healthy subjects as determined via western blotting and RT-qPCR. The results indicated that aberrant expression patterns of H4K16ac and KAT8 might be associated with AD progression. Moreover, western blot analysis demonstrated that KAT8-overexpression cells displayed increased levels of H4K16ac, accompanied by higher levels of neuroprotective soluble amyloid precursor protein (sAPP)α and β-secretase (BACE)2, and decreased levels of sAPPβ and BACE1 compared with negative control and vector cells. In neurodegenerative disorders, microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) are deregulated; however, the effect of miRNA dysregulation on histone acetylation is not completely understood. To the best of our knowledge, the present study identified a novel inhibitory interaction between miR-149-5p and KAT8 3'-UTR that contributed to the pathological alterations in an AD cell model for the first time, using bioinformatics and a dual-luciferase reporter assay. The western blotting results indicated that, compared with the inhibitor control group, miR-149-5p inhibitor markedly increased H4K16ac levels, which were significantly suppressed by co-transfection with KAT8 short hairpin (sh)RNA. KAT8 shRNA and miR-149-5p inhibitor co-transfection abolished the beneficial effects of miR-149-5p inhibitor. The results indicated that miR-149-5p regulated KAT8 and H4K16ac expression in an AD cell model, which may be associated with the pathological process of AD; therefore, miRNA may serve as a potential drug target for AD.","1792-0981","Experimental and therapeutic medicine","(20) 88",2020,"Fuyan","Chen","F","Department of Acupuncture and Moxibustion, First Teaching Hospital of Tianjin University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Tianjin 300193, P.R.

In this study, we further found that germline overexpression of mir-38 decreased expressions of nhl-2 encoding a miRISC cofactor, ndk-1 encoding a homolog of NM23-H1, and wrt-3 encoding a homolog of PPIL-2. Meanwhile, germline-specific RNAi knockdown of nhl-2, ndk-1, or wrt-3 caused the resistance to nanopolystyrene toxicity. Additionally, mir-38 overexpression suppressed the resistance of nematodes overexpressing germline nhl-2, ndk-1, or wrt-3 containing 3'UTR, suggesting the role of NHL-2, NDK-1, and WRT-3 as the targets of germline mir-38 in regulating the response to nanopolystyrene. Moreover, during the control of response to nanopolystyrene, EKL-1, a Tudor domain protein, was identified as the downstream target of germline NHL-2, kinase suppressors of Ras (KSR-1 and KSR-2) were identified as the downstream targets of germline NDK-1, and ASP-2, a homolog of BACE1, was identified as the downstream target of germline WRT-3.

Reduction of amyloid plaques and oxidative stress emerge as a convincing treatment strategy. Plaque reduction is achieved by inhibition of BACE1, the rate limiting enzyme generating the prime constituent of plaques, Aβ, through proteolysis of the amyloid precursor protein. Here, we report a QSAR model with five descriptors, developed to screen natural compounds as potent BACE1 inhibitors. Seven compounds out of which five flavonols namely isorhamnetin, syringetin, galangin, tamarixetin, rhamnetin and two flavanonols namely dihydromyricetin, taxifolin were screened. The ability of these compounds were validated using the BACE1 activity assay. The antioxidant property were estimated by the DPPH and ABTS assay. Although inhibition assay implied syringetin to be a promising BACE1 inhibitor, its poor antioxidant activity leaves it less effective as a multitarget ligand. Exhibiting moderate dual ability, isorhamnetin and taxifolin qualified as multi-target scaffolds for AD therapeutics. Our study reveals the importance of 4'-OH in the B ring of flavonols and the lack of any effect of 5'-OH in flavanonols for BACE1 inhibition.

Sulforaphane exhibited six times more potent activity against BACE1 compared to well-known positive controls including resveratrol and quercetin. Sulforaphane presented selective and non-competitive BACE1 inhibitory activity with low off-target inhibition of BACE2 and other aspartic and serine proteases. In addition, sulforaphane presented negative binding energy, suggesting that the compound had a high affinity for BACE1.

33068684,"Dickkopf-related protein-1 inhibition attenuates amyloid-beta pathology associated to Alzheimer's disease.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) constitutes the leading cause of dementia worldwide. It is associated to amyloid-β (Aβ) aggregation and tau hyper-phosphorylation, accompanied by a progressive cognitive decline. Evidence suggests that the canonical Wnt pathway is deregulated in AD. Pathway activity is mediated by β-catenin stabilization in the cytosol, and subsequent translocation to the nucleus to regulate the expression of several genes implicated in brain homeostasis and functioning. It was recently proposed that Dickkopf-related protein-1 (DKK1), an endogenous antagonist of the pathway, might be implicated in AD pathogenesis. Here, we hypothesized that canonical Wnt pathway deactivation associated to DKK1 induction contributes to late-onset AD pathogenesis, and thus DKK1 neutralization could attenuate AD pathology. For this purpose, human post-mortem AD brain samples were used to assess pathway activity, and aged APPswe/PS1 mice were used to investigate DKK1 in late-onset AD-like pathology and therapy. Our findings indicate that β-catenin levels progressively decrease in the brain of AD patients, correlating with the duration of symptoms. Next, we found that Aβ pathology in APPswe/PS1 mediates DKK1 induction in the brain. Pharmacological neutralization of DKK1's biological activity in APPswe/PS1 mice restores pathway activity by stabilizing β-catenin, attenuates Aβ pathology, and ameliorates the memory of mice. Attenuation of AD-like pathology upon DKK1 inhibition is accompanied by a reduced protein expression of beta-site amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE1). Moreover, DKK1 inhibition enhances vascular density, promotes blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity by increasing claudin 5, glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1), and ATP-binding cassette sub-family B member-1 (ABCB1) protein expression, as well as ameliorates synaptic plasticity by increasing brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD-95) protein expression. DKK1 conditional induction reduces claudin 5, abcb1, and psd-95 mRNA expression, validating its inhibition effects. Our results indicate that neutralization of DKK1's biological activity attenuates AD-like pathology by restoring canonical Wnt pathway activity.","1872-9754","Neurochemistry international","(141) 104881",2020,"Romain","Menet","R","Neuroscience Axis, Research Center of CHU de Québec - Université Laval, Quebec City, QC, Canada; Department of Psychiatry and Neuroscience, Faculty of Medicine, Université Laval, Quebec City, QC, Canada."

However, the roles of VD deficiency in the pathology of AD remain largely unexplored. In this study, APP/PS1 mice were fed a VD-deficient diet for 13 weeks to evaluate the effects of VD deficiency on the learning and memory functions and the neuropathological characteristics of the mice. Our study revealed that VD deficiency accelerated cognitive impairment in the APP/PS1 mice. Mechanistic studies revealed that VD deficiency promoted glial activation and increased inflammatory factor secretion. Furthermore, VD deficiency increased the production and deposition of Aβ by elevating the expression levels of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and β-site APP cleavage enzyme 1 (BACE1). In addition, VD deficiency increased the phosphorylation of Tau at Thr181, Thr205 and Ser396 by increasing the activities of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (CDK5) and glycogen synthase kinase 3α/β (GSK3α/β) and promoted synaptic dystrophy and neuronal loss. All these effects of VD deficiency may be ascribed to enhanced oxidative stress via the downregulation of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1), glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPx4) and cystine/glutamate exchanger (xCT). Taken together, our data suggest that VD deficiency exacerbates Alzheimer-like pathologies via promoting inflammatory stress, increasing Aβ production and elevating Tau phosphorylation by decreasing antioxidant capacity in the brains of APP/PS1 mice.

Recent studies indicated that the components of bacterial biofilm drive the amyloid-β production. Muramyl dipeptide, the minimal bioactive peptidoglycan motif common to all bacteria, contributes to the development of many central inflammatory and neurodegenerative disorders. However, the involvement of Muramyl dipeptide in amyloid-β production is not completely defined. In our present study, wild type mice received an intracerebroventricular injection of normal saline or Muramyl dipeptide. Data showed that the production of Aβ1-42 oligomers was significantly increased after Muramyl dipeptide injection in the wild type mice or incubation of the SH-SY5Y cells with Muramyl dipeptide. Moreover, the action of Muramyl dipeptide was dose- and time-dependent. The above results suggested a possibility that the Muramyl dipeptide-induced Aβ1-42 oligomer production might be related to the NOD2/p-p38 MAPK/BACE1 pathway. To confirm this, the SH-SY5Y cells were transfected with siRNA NOD2. Data showed that the transfected SH-SY5Y cells exhibited decreased expression of Aβ1-42 oligomer, NOD2, p-p38 MAPK, and BACE1 after treatment with Muramyl dipeptide. Finally, SH-SY5Y cells were pretreated with SB203580, an inhibitor of the p-38-MAPK pathway. The results indicated that these pretreated SH-SY5Y cells exhibited decreased expression of Aβ1-42 oligomer, p-p38 MAPK, and BACE1 after treatment with Muramyl dipeptide. In conclusion, these results suggested that Muramyl dipeptide was the trigger factor for Aβ1-42 oligomer production, which probably acts via the NOD2/p-p38 MAPK/BACE1 signaling pathway.","0219-6352","Journal of integrative neuroscience","(19) 421-428",2020,"Yan-Jie","Chen","YJ","Geriatrics Department of Chinese Medicine, Huadong Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, 200040, P.

Pharmacological inhibition of EphA4 signaling and knockdown of Epha4 led to increased Aβ levels accompanied by increased expression of β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), which is an enzyme responsible for Aβ production. Moreover, EPHA4 overexpression and activation of EphA4 signaling via ephrin ligands decreased Aβ levels. In particular, the sterile-alpha motif domain of EphA4 was necessary for the regulation of Aβ production. Finally, EPHA4 mRNA levels were significantly reduced in the brains of AD patients, and negatively correlated with BACE1 mRNA levels. Our results indicate a novel mechanism of Aβ regulation by EphA4, which is involved in AD pathogenesis.","1530-6860","FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology","(34) 16383-16396",2020,"Kensuke","Tamura","K","Laboratory of Neuropathology and Neuroscience, Graduate School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan."
33096140,"STAT3 inhibition protects against neuroinflammation and BACE1 upregulation induced by systemic inflammation.","Abnormal activation of the transcriptional factor STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) was recently associated with Alzheimer Disease (AD). STAT3 phosphorylation is critical for cytokine secretion linked to neuroinflammation. Moreover, STAT3 may act as a transcriptional regulator of BACE1 (β-APP cleaving enzyme-1), the key enzyme in amyloid β (Aβ) production. We have previously shown that neuroinflammation and increased brain BACE1 levels triggered by LPS-induced systemic inflammation in wild-type mice are associated with an enhanced STAT3 activation. Using this LPS model, the goal of this study was to investigate if a STAT3 inhibitor administration could be protective against neuroinflammation and abnormal BACE1 regulation. Our results show that intraperitoneal injection of Stattic, a molecule that selectively inhibits the activation of STAT3, decreases LPS-induced microglial activation in the hippocampus. In addition, STAT3 inhibition reduced brain levels of cytokines IL-6, IL-1β and TNF-α triggered by LPS systemic administration. A significant reduction of BACE1 levels was observed in the hippocampus of mice treated with LPS and Stattic compared to those exposed to LPS alone. Taking together, our results show that Stattic can protect hippocampus against two pathological hallmarks of AD, and pave the way for further explorations of the therapeutic potential of STAT3 inhibition in AD.","1879-0542","Immunology letters","(228) 129-134",2020,"Périne","Millot","P","INSERM U1144 Optimisation Thérapeutique en Neuropsychopharmacologie, Université de Paris, Paris, France; Centre de Neurologie Cognitive/CMRR Paris Nord Ile de France, APHP Nord Université de Paris, Lariboisière Hospital, Paris, France."
33132271,"[Molecular Basis of Preventive Effects of Habitual Coffee Intake against Chronic Diseases].","Epidemiological studies have shown that coffee consumption may be associated with a lower risk of developing several chronic disorders. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of the effects of coffee, we analyzed molecular response upon exposure to coffee extract using cellular and animal models of these diseases. As obesity is recognized as a major risk factor for these chronic diseases, we investigated the effect of coffee on adipogenesis using mouse preadipocyte 3T3-L1 cells. We found that coffee induced proteasomal degradation of IRS-1, leading to reduction of PPARγ expression, a master transcription factor for adipogenesis. Reduction in weight as well as in IRS-1 expression was detected in the fat tissues of the high fat-diet-fed mice when reared with 60% coffee for 7 weeks. As for Alzheimer's disease, we analyzed the effect of coffee on amyloid β (Aβ) production in human neuronal SH-SY5Y cells. We found a 20% reduction in Aβ production when treated with 2.5% coffee for 2 d. This reduction was due to proteasomal degradation of BACE1 (β-secretase), which was activated by protein kinase A. In addition, coffee ameliorates LPS-induced inflammatory responses in RAW264.7 macrophages by reducing NFκB activity and Nrf2 activation. Roasted coffee prevents selenite-induced cataractogenesis by ameliorating antioxidant loss. Pyrocatechol, a component of roasted coffee, also reduced Aβ production and exhibits anti-inflammatory effects by a similar mechanism as coffee. Our results suggest that roasting coffee beans to generate pyrocatechol is necessary for the preventive effects of coffee intake on the chronic diseases.","1347-5231","Yakugaku zasshi : Journal of the Pharmaceutical Society of Japan","(140) 1351-1363",2020,"Hiroomi","Tamura","H","Faculty of Pharmacy, Keio University."

Using the transgenic APP/PS1/Tau triple transgenic AD (3×Tg-AD) mouse model and mouse-derived microglia and neuroblastoma cell lines, we found that chronic 5-month Mn treatment increased beta amyloid peptide (Aβ) expression and Aβ plaques in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus in these 3×Tg-AD mice. Furthermore, we found that the β- and γ-secretase cleavage activities were markedly increased, while α-secretase cleavage activity was reduced in the brain of Mn-treated AD mice; these effects increase Aβ production and thus are amyloidogenic. Equally important, Mn treatment alone did not alter β-secretase 1 (BACE1) gene expression or Aβ production in amyloidogenic mutant amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene hAPPsw-transfected N2a cells (APPsw-N2a), but in APPsw-N2a cells either co-cultured with microglia or cultured with microglia-conditioned media, Mn exposure increased BACE1 expression and amyloidogenesis. We further determined that Mn exposure promoted the activation of microglia both in 3×Tg-AD mouse brains and in cultured microglia cells, and increased the secretion of the inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Taken together, these results suggest that Mn may increase the release of IL-1β and TNF-α from microglia that in turn stimulates the expression of BACE1 gene and protein and consequently Aβ production; this novel molecular mechanism not only advances our understanding about the amyloidogenic effect of chronic Mn exposure reported for special human populations but also indicates Mn dyshomeostasis as a potential contributor to AD pathogenesis.","1663-4365","Frontiers in aging neuroscience","(12) 556008",2020,"Geng","Lin","G","Department of Histology and Embryology, China Medical University, Shenyang, China."

We show that statins are effective at reducing Aβ in human neurons from nondemented control subjects, as well as subjects with familial AD and sporadic AD. Aβ is derived from amyloid precursor protein (APP) through sequential proteolytic cleavage by BACE1 and γ-secretase. While previous studies have shown that cholesterol metabolism regulates APP processing to Aβ, the mechanism is not well understood. We used iPSC-derived neurons and bimolecular fluorescence complementation assays in transfected cells to elucidate how altering cholesterol metabolism influences APP processing. Altering cholesterol metabolism using statins decreased the generation of sAPPβ and increased levels of full-length APP (flAPP), indicative of reduced processing of APP by BACE1. We further show that statins decrease flAPP interaction with BACE1 and enhance APP dimerization. Additionally, statin-induced changes in APP dimerization and APP-BACE1 are dependent on cholesterol binding to APP. Our data indicate that statins reduce Aβ production by decreasing BACE1 interaction with flAPP and suggest that this process may be regulated through competition between APP dimerization and APP cholesterol binding.","1939-4586","Molecular biology of the cell","(32) 247-259",2021,"Vanessa F","Langness","VF","Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, CA 92093."

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the role and mechanism of exosomes signaling in AD. Double transgenic APP/PS1 mice were injected with bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs)-derived exosomes or combined with SKI-Ⅱ (sphingosine kinase [SphK] inhibitor) or VPC23019 (sphingosine-1-phosphate [S1P] 1 receptor blocker). We observed the spatial learning and memory ability of mice, and assessed the levels of amyloid and proteins. We found that exosomes improved spatial learning and memory ability of APP/PS1 mice, and enhanced the expression of SphK1 and S1P1. Moreover, exosomes inhibited the levels of amyloid and enhanced the expression of NeuN in cortex and hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. Exosomes repressed the levels of Aβ1-40, Aβ1-42, BACE1, and PS1, and promoted the expression of neprilysin in APP/PS1 mice. The influence conferred by exosomes was abolished by SKI-Ⅱ or VPC23019. In conclusion, our article confirms that BM-MSCs-derived exosomes reduce Aβ deposition and promote cognitive function recovery in AD mice by activating SphK/S1P signaling pathway.

33347668,"Protection against Alzheimer's disease by luteolin: Role of brain glucose regulation, anti-inflammatory activity, and the gut microbiota-liver-brain axis.","Luteolin is a widely distributed flavone herbs and vegetables. It has anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activities and improves glucose metabolism by potentiating insulin sensitivity and improving β-cell function and mass. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is induced by the deposition of amyloid-beta (Aβ) in the hippocampus and the formation of neurotoxic Aβ plaques. The Aβ deposition is associated with increased formation of Aβ from amyloid precursor protein by up-regulation of β-secretase and β-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1). Furthermore, Aβ accumulation is increased by brain insulin resistance. The impairment of insulin/IGF-1 signaling mainly in the hippocampus and brain insulin resistance is connected to signals originating in the liver and gut microbiota, known as the gut microbiota-liver-brain axis. This indicates that the changes in the production of short-chain fatty acids by the gut microbiota and pro-inflammatory cytokines can alter insulin resistance in the liver and brain. Luteolin is detected in the brain tissues after passing through the blood-brain barrier, where it can directly influence neuroinflammation and brain insulin resistance and modulate Aβ deposition. Luteolin (10-70 mg/kg bw for rodents) can modulate the systemic and brain insulin resistance, and it suppresses AD development directly, and it influences Aβ deposition by activation of the gut microbiota-liver-brain axis. In this review, we evaluate the potential of luteolin to mitigate two potential causes of AD, neuroinflammatory processes, and disruption of glucose metabolism in the brain. This review suggests that luteolin intake can enhance brain insulin resistance and neuroinflammation, directly and indirectly, to protect against the development of Alzheimer's-like disease, and the gut microbiota-liver-brain axis is mainly involved in the indirect pathway. However, most studies have been conducted in animal studies, and human clinical trials are needed.","1872-8081","BioFactors (Oxford, England)","(47) 218-231",2021,"James W","Daily","JW","Department of R&D, Daily Manufacturing Inc, Rockwell, North Carolina, USA."

Replica exchange molecular dynamics (REMD) is a widely used enhanced sampling method to explore protein conformational space. However, REMD with an explicit solvent model requires huge computational resources, immensely limiting its application. In this study, a variation of parallel tempering metadynamics (PTMetaD) with the omission of solvent-solvent interactions in exchange attempts and the use of low-frequency modes calculated by normal-mode analysis (NMA) as collective variables (CVs), namely ossPTMetaD, is proposed with the aim to accelerate MD simulations simultaneously in temperature and geometrical spaces. For testing the performance of ossPTMetaD, five protein systems with diverse biological functions and motion patterns were selected, including large-scale domain motion (AdK), flap movement (HIV-1 protease and BACE1), and DFG-motif flip in kinases (p38α and c-Abl). The simulation results showed that ossPTMetaD requires much fewer numbers of replicas than temperature REMD (T-REMD) with a reduction of ∼70% to achieve a similar exchange ratio. Although it does not obey the detailed balance condition, ossPTMetaD provides consistent results with T-REMD and experimental data. The high accessibility of the large conformational change of protein systems by ossPTMetaD, especially in simulating the very challenging DFG-motif flip of protein kinases, demonstrated its high efficiency and robustness in the characterization of the large-scale protein conformational change pathway and associated free energy profile.","1549-9626","Journal of chemical theory and computation","(17) 13-28",2021,"Cheng","Peng","C","CAS Key Laboratory of Receptor Research; Drug Discovery and Design Center, Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 555 Zuchongzhi Road, Shanghai, 201203, China."

The Amyloid precursor protein (APP) is cleaved by α-secretase (non-amyloidogenic processing of APP), however increased cleavage by β-secretase (BACE1) leads to the accumulation of Aβ peptides, which forms plaques. APP mutations mapping to exons 16 and 17 favor plaque accumulation and cause Familial Alzheimer Disease (FAD). However, a variant of the APP gene (A673T) originally found in an Icelandic population reduces BACE1 cleavage by 40%. A series of plasmids containing the APP gene, each with one of 29 different FAD mutations mapping to exon 16 and exon 17 was created. These plasmids were then replicated with the addition of the A673T mutation. Combined these formed the library of plasmids that was used in this study. The plasmids were transfected in neuroblastomas to assess the effect of this mutation on Aβ peptide production. The production of Aβ peptides was decreased for some FAD mutations due to the presence of the co-dominant A673T mutation. The reduction of Aβ peptide concentrations for the London mutation (V717I) even reached the same level as for A673T control in SH-SY5Y cells. These preliminary results suggest that the insertion of A673T in APP genes containing FAD mutations might confer a clinical benefit in preventing or delaying the onset of some FADs.","1932-6203","PloS one","(15) e0237122",2020,"Antoine","Guyon","A","Centre de Recherche du CHU, Québec-Université Laval, Québec, Québec, Canada."

Most cases are sporadic (>95% of cases) after the age of 65 years, implicating an important role of environmental factors in disease pathogenesis. Environmental neurotoxicants have been implicated in neurodegenerative disorders including Parkinson's Disease and AD. Animal models of AD and in vitro studies have shed light on potential neuropathological mechanisms, yet the biochemical and molecular underpinnings of AD-relevant environmental neurotoxicity remain poorly understood. Beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) is a potentially critical pathogenic target of environmentally induced neurotoxicity. BACE1 clearly has a critical role in AD pathophysiology: It is required for amyloid beta production and expression and activity of BACE1 are increased in the AD brain. Though the literature on BACE1 in response to environmental insults is limited, current studies, along with extensive AD neurobiology literature suggest that BACE1 deserves attention as an important neurotoxic target. Here, we critically review research on environmental neurotoxicants such as metals, pesticides, herbicides, fungicides, polyfluoroalkyl substances, heterocyclic aromatic amines, advanced glycation end products, and acrolein that modulate BACE1 and potential mechanisms of action. Though more research is needed to clearly understand whether BACE1 is a critical mediator of AD-relevant neurotoxicity, available reports provide convincing evidence that BACE1 is altered by environmental risk factors associated with AD pathology, implying that BACE1 inhibition and its use as a biomarker should be considered in AD management and research.","1099-0461","Journal of biochemical and molecular toxicology","(35) e22694",2021,"Tauqeerunnisa","Syeda","T","School of Health Sciences, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana, USA."

Vanillic acid (V.A), a flavoring agent, is a benzoic acid derivative having a broad range of biological activities, including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms of V.A in exerting neuroprotection are not well investigated. The present study aims to explore the neuroprotective effects of V.A against lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced neuroinflammation, amyloidogenesis, synaptic/memory dysfunction, and neurodegeneration in mice brain. Behavioral tests and biochemical and immunofluorescence assays were applied. Our results indicated increased expression of RAGE and its downstream phospho-c-Jun n-terminal kinase (p-JNK) in the LPS-alone treated group, which was significantly reduced in the V.A + LPS co-treated group. We also found that systemic administration of LPS-injection induced glial cells (microglia and astrocytes) activation and significantly increased expression level of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-KB) and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1 β (IL1-β), and cyclooxygenase (COX-2). However, V.A + LPS co-treatment significantly inhibited the LPS-induced activation of glial cells and neuroinflammatory mediators. Moreover, we also noted that V.A treatment significantly attenuated LPS-induced increases in the expression of AD markers, such as β-site amyloid precursor protein (APP)-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and amyloid-β (Aβ). Furthermore, V.A treatment significantly reversed LPS-induced synaptic loss via enhancing the expression level of pre- and post-synaptic markers (PSD-95 and SYP), and improved memory performance in LPS-alone treated group. Taken together; we suggest that neuroprotective effects of V.A against LPS-induced neurotoxicity might be via inhibition of LPS/RAGE mediated JNK signaling pathway; and encourage future studies that V.A would be a potential neuroprotective and neurotherapeutic candidate in various neurological disorders.","1422-0067","International journal of molecular sciences","E361",2020,"Rahat","Ullah","R","Division of Life Sciences and Applied Life Science (BK 21plus), College of Natural Science, Gyeongsang National University, Jinju 52828, Korea."

Increased fracture risk has also been associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) in the aged. Here, we sought to identify possible relationships between the pathologies of osteoporosis and dementia by analysing bone expression of neurotropic or dementia-related genes in patients undergoing THR surgery for NOF fracture. Femoral bone samples from 66 NOF patients were examined for expression of the neurotropic genes amyloid precursor protein (APP), APP-like protein-2 (APLP2), Beta-Secretase Cleaving Enzyme-1 (BACE1) and nerve growth factor (NGF). Relationships were examined between the expression of these and of bone regulatory genes, systemic factors and bone structural parameters ascertained from plain radiographs. We found strong relative levels of expression and positive correlations between APP, APLP2, BACE1 and NGF levels in NOF bone. Significant correlations were found between APP, APLP2, BACE1 mRNA levels and bone remodelling genes TRAP, RANKL, and the RANKL:OPG mRNA ratio, indicative of potential functional relationships at the time of fracture.

33410374,"Unravelling the molecular basis of AM-6494 high potency at BACE1 in Alzheimer's disease: an integrated dynamic interaction investigation.","β-amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme1 (BACE1) has prominently been an important drug design target implicated in Alzheimer's disease pathway. The failure rate of most of the already tested drugs at different clinical phases remains a major concern. Recently, AM-6494 was reported as a novel potent, highly selective, and orally effective inhibitor against BACE1. AM-6494 displayed no alteration of skin/fur colour in animal studies, an adverse effect common to previous BACE1 inhibitors. However, the atomistic molecular mechanism of BACE1 inhibition by AM-6494 remains unclear. To elucidate the binding mechanism of AM-6494 relative to umibecestat (CNP-520) as well as the structural changes when bound to BACE1, advanced computational techniques such as accelerated MD simulation and principal component analysis have been utilised. The results demonstrated higher binding affinity of AM-6494 at BACE1 with van der Waals as dominant energy contributor compared to umibecestat. Conformational monitoring of the β-hairpin flap covering the active site revealed an effective flap closure when bound with AM-6494 compared to CNP-520, which predominantly alternates between semi-open and closed conformations. The observed effective flap closure of AM-6494 explains its higher inhibitory power towards BACE1. Besides the catalytic Asp32/228 dyad, Tyr14, Leu30, Tyr71 and Gly230 represent critical residues in the potency of these inhibitors at BACE1 binding interface. The findings highlighted in this research provide a basis to explain AM-6494 high inhibitory potency and might assist in the design of new inhibitors with improved selectivity and potency for BACE1.","1538-0254","Journal of biomolecular structure & dynamics","(40) 5253-5265",2022,"Samuel C","Ugbaja","SC","Discipline of Medical Biochemistry, School of Laboratory Medicine and Medical Science, University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, South Africa."

33411695,"Sodium channel β1 subunits participate in regulated intramembrane proteolysis-excitation coupling.","Loss-of-function (LOF) variants in SCN1B, encoding voltage-gated sodium channel β1 subunits, are linked to human diseases with high risk of sudden death, including developmental and epileptic encephalopathy and cardiac arrhythmia. β1 Subunits modulate the cell-surface localization, gating, and kinetics of sodium channel pore-forming α subunits. They also participate in cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion, resulting in intracellular signal transduction, promotion of cell migration, calcium handling, and regulation of cell morphology. Here, we investigated regulated intramembrane proteolysis (RIP) of β1 by BACE1 and γ-secretase and show that β1 subunits are substrates for sequential RIP by BACE1 and γ-secretase, resulting in the generation of a soluble intracellular domain (ICD) that is translocated to the nucleus. Using RNA sequencing, we identified a subset of genes that are downregulated by β1-ICD overexpression in heterologous cells but upregulated in Scn1b-null cardiac tissue, which lacks β1-ICD signaling, suggesting that the β1-ICD may normally function as a molecular brake on gene transcription in vivo. We propose that human disease variants resulting in SCN1B LOF cause transcriptional dysregulation that contributes to altered excitability. Moreover, these results provide important insights into the mechanism of SCN1B-linked channelopathies, adding RIP-excitation coupling to the multifunctionality of sodium channel β1 subunits.","2379-3708","JCI insight","10.1172/jci.insight.141776",2021,"Alexandra A","Bouza","AA","Department of Pharmacology, University of Michigan Medical School, Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA."

The effect of miR-149 on Aβ accumulation and neuronal viability was analyzed in Aβ-treated SH-SY5Y cells. miR-149 was found directly binding the 3'-UTR of BACE1 and was negatively correlated with BACE1 in AD patients and cell model. Serum miR-149 expression was downregulated in AD patients and served as a potential diagnostic biomarker. The overexpression of miR-149 in Aβ-treated SH-SY5Y cells resulted in inhibited Aβ accumulation and enhanced neuronal viability. This study demonstrated that serum miR-149 is decreased in AD patients and serves as a candidate diagnostic biomarker, and that the overexpression of miR-149 may suppress Aβ accumulation and promote neuronal viability by targeting BACE1 in AD model cells.","1415-4757","Genetics and molecular biology","(44) e20200064",2021,"Wenyan","Du","W","Zibo Central Hospital, Department of Science and Education, Zibo, Shandong, China."

CSF contains hundreds of proteins, with concentrations reflecting ongoing (patho)physiological processes. This provides the opportunity to study many biological processes at the same time in patients. We studied whether Alzheimer's disease biological subtypes can be detected in CSF proteomics using the dual clustering technique non-negative matrix factorization. In two independent cohorts (EMIF-AD MBD and ADNI) we found that 705 (77% of 911 tested) proteins differed between Alzheimer's disease (defined as having abnormal amyloid, n = 425) and controls (defined as having normal CSF amyloid and tau and normal cognition, n = 127). Using these proteins for data-driven clustering, we identified three robust pathophysiological Alzheimer's disease subtypes within each cohort showing (i) hyperplasticity and increased BACE1 levels; (ii) innate immune activation; and (iii) blood-brain barrier dysfunction with low BACE1 levels. In both cohorts, the majority of individuals were labelled as having subtype 1 (80, 36% in EMIF-AD MBD; 117, 59% in ADNI), 71 (32%) in EMIF-AD MBD and 41 (21%) in ADNI were labelled as subtype 2, and 72 (32%) in EMIF-AD MBD and 39 (20%) individuals in ADNI were labelled as subtype 3. Genetic analyses showed that all subtypes had an excess of genetic risk for Alzheimer's disease (all P > 0.01). Additional pathological comparisons that were available for a subset in ADNI suggested that subtypes showed similar severity of Alzheimer's disease pathology, and did not differ in the frequencies of co-pathologies, providing further support that found subtypes truly reflect Alzheimer's disease heterogeneity. Compared to controls, all non-demented Alzheimer's disease individuals had increased risk of showing clinical progression (all P < 0.01). Compared to subtype 1, subtype 2 showed faster clinical progression after correcting for age, sex, level of education and tau levels (hazard ratio = 2.5; 95% confidence interval = 1.2, 5.1; P = 0.01), and subtype 3 at trend level (hazard ratio = 2.1; 95% confidence interval = 1.0, 4.4; P = 0.06). Together, these results demonstrate the value of CSF proteomics in studying the biological heterogeneity in Alzheimer's disease patients, and suggest that subtypes may require tailored therapy.","1460-2156","Brain : a journal of neurology","(143) 3776-3792",2020,"Betty M","Tijms","BM","Alzheimer Center Amsterdam, Department of Neurology, Amsterdam Neuroscience, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam UMC - Location VUmc, The Netherlands."

The miR-155 is one of the overexpressed miRNAs in DS patients that contribute directly and indirectly to the onset or progression of the DS. Since the miR-155 can simultaneously reduce the translation of several genes at post-transcriptional levels, targeting the miR-155 might set the stage for the treatment of DS. One of the rational strategies in providing therapeutic interventions in this respect is to design and develop novel small molecules inhibiting the miR-155 function or biogenesis or maturation. In the present study, we aim to introduce small molecule compounds with the potential to inhibit the generation of the selectively miR-155 processing by employing computational drug design approaches, as well as in vitro studies. We designed and synthesized a novel series of imidazo[1,2-a]pyridines derivatives as new nonpeptic candidates for the treatment of DS with AD.

AD is marked by the presence of extracellular amyloid plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) and synaptic losses. Increased cases of AD in recent times created a dire need to discover or identify chemical compounds that can cease the development of AD. This study focuses on finding potential drug molecule(s) active against β-secretase, also known as β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1). Clustering analysis followed by phylogenetic studies on microarray datasets retrieved from GEO browser showed that BACE1 gene has genetic relatedness with the RCAN1 gene. A ligand library comprising 60 natural compounds retrieved from literature and 25 synthetic compounds collected from DrugBank were screened. Further, 350 analogues of potential parent compounds were added to the library for the docking purposes. Molecular docking studies identified 11-oxotigogenin as the best ligand molecule. The compound showed the binding affinity of - 11.1 Kcal/mole and forms three hydrogen bonds with Trp124, Ile174, and Arg176. The protein-ligand complex was subjected to 25 ns molecular dynamics simulation and the potential energy of the complex was found to be - 1.24579e+06 Kcal/mole.

In a series of studies on sulfur-containing amino acids, another cysteine related un-natural amino acid, α-methyl cysteine, was used for the total syntheses of natural products containing a unique thiazorine/thiazole ring system. Chloroimidazolidium coupling reagent developed by us was effective for the successive couplings of the α-methyl cysteine residues. Based on these synthetic studies, design and evaluation of protease inhibitors were then studied, since a stereo-specific synthesis of the key structure is crucial to make the inhibitor an effective functional molecule in the interactions with its target protease. As the target proteases, β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and chymotrypsin-like protease of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS 3CL protease) were selected: the former is a crucial enzyme for amyloid β production and the latter is an essential enzyme for the re-construction of SARS corona virus in host cells.

Iron levels and iron metabolism-related proteins and apoptosis-related factors in hippocampus and cortex tissues were detected by using synchrotron radiation micro-X-ray fluorescence (μ-XRF) and western blotting. Our results showed that a decline in cognitive function was observed in mice treated with Sev. Sev significantly induced iron accumulation through upregulating ferritin and downregulating transferrin receptor 1 which involved in ferroportin1 (Fpn1)/hepcidin pathway and increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) content of hippocampus and cortex. Sev aggravated BACE1 expression and Aβ accumulation. Changes in the ratio of Bcl2/Bax and Tau/p-Tau intensified the cell apoptosis in hippocampus and cortex tissues. Interestingly, the cognitive deficiency and neurotoxicity induced by Sev could be ameliorated significantly by feeding a low-iron diet to mice prior to anesthesia. The data uncovered a new lesion mechanism of Sev from the role of iron metabolism.

However, the contribution of ovarian E2 and hippocampal E2 to spatial memory and neural plasticity remains unclear. In this study, AROM-specific RNA interference AAVs (shAROM) were constructed and injected into the hippocampus of control or ovariectomized (OVX) mice. Four weeks later the spatial learning and memory behavior was examined with Morris water maze, the expression of hippocampal Aβ related proteins, selected synaptic proteins and CA1 synapse density, actin polymerization related proteins and CA1 spine density were also examined. The results showed that while OVX and hippocampal shAROM contributed similarly to most of the parameters examined, shAROM induced more increase in BACE1 (amyloidogenic β-secretase), more decrease in neprilysin (Aβ remover) and Profilin-1 (actin polymerization inducer). More importantly, combined OVX and shAROM treatment displayed most significant impairment of spatial learning and memory as well as decrease in synaptic plasticity compared to OVX or shAROM alone. In conclusion, the above results clearly demonstrated the crucial role of hippocampal E2 in the regulation of the structure and function of hippocampus besides ovarian E2, indicating that hippocampal E2 content should also be taken into consideration during estrogenic replacement.","1573-6903","Neurochemical research","(46) 1188-1202",2021,"Zhen","Lan","Z","Department of Neurobiology, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China."

The protection of RPE disorders plays an essential role in the pathological progress of retinal degeneration diseases. The pharmacological functions of fucoxanthin, a characteristic carotenoid, including anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, may ameliorate an outstanding bioactivity against premature senescence and cellular dysfunction. This study demonstrates that fucoxanthin protects RPE cells from oxidative stress-induced premature senescence and decreased photoreceptor cell loss in a sodium iodate-induced AMD animal model. Similarly, oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide, nuclear phosphorylated histone (γH2AX) deposition and premature senescence-associated β-galactosidase staining were inhibited by fucoxanthin pretreatment in a human RPE cell line, ARPE-19 cells. Results reveal that fucoxanthin treatment significantly inhibited reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, reduced malondialdehyde (MDA) concentrations and increased the mitochondrial metabolic rate in oxidative stress-induced RPE cell damage. Moreover, atrophy of apical microvilli was inhibited in cells treated with fucoxanthin after oxidative stress.

The delivery route can impact not only delivery but also targeting and therapeutic efficacy of ARBs. Our previous findings on the beneficial effects of intranasally delivered losartan in the APP/PS1 model of AD prompted us to explore the influence of the delivery route by employing here the systemic administration of losartan. Consistent with our previous results with intranasal losartan, repeated intraperitoneal administration (10 mg/kg) resulted in a remarkable decrease in Aβ plaques and soluble Aβ42, as well as inflammatory cytokines (IL-2, IL-6 and TNFα). The Aβ reduction can be ascribed to its facilitated degradation by neprilysin and diminished generation by BACE1. Losartan increased neurogenesis in vivo and in vitro and improved migratory properties of astrocytes isolated from adult transgenic AD mice. In summary, this data together with our previous results suggest therapeutic features of losartan which are independent of delivery route.

In order to find out the potential inhibitors of BACE1, the present study focused on five phytochemicals from Pueraria tuberosa, namely, daidzin, genistin, mangiferin, puerarin, and tuberosin. A molecular docking study showed that all five phytochemicals presented the strongest BACE1 inhibition. Integrated molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations demonstrated that all five natural compounds have stable and favorable energies causing strong binding with the pocket site of BACE1 on 50 ns. All these molecules also passed Lipinski's rule of five. To validate the molecular modeling based findings, we primarily targeted the cognitive decline associated with BACE1 expression in AD flies with P. tuberosa. Significant improvement in cognitive decline was observed in AD flies in different behavioral assays such as Larval crawling assay (16.38%), Larval light preference assay (26.39%), Climbing assay (32.97%), Cold sensitivity assay (43.6%), and Thermal sensitivity assay (44.42%). The present findings suggest that P. tuberosa may be considered as a promising dietary supplement that can significantly ameliorate cognitive decline caused by BACE1 in Alzheimer's disease (AD).","1879-0003","International journal of biological macromolecules","(179) 586-600",2021,"Anami","Ahuja","A","Research Scholar, Department of Biotechnology, Dr. A.P.J.

33713326,"Melatonin Attenuates High Glucose-Induced Changes in Beta Amyloid Precursor Protein Processing in Human Neuroblastoma Cells.","Diabetes mellitus (DM), one of metabolic diseases, has been suggested as a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, how the metabolic pathway activates amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing enzymes then contributes to the increase of amyloid-beta (Aβ) production, is not clearly understood. In the present study, we aimed to examine the protective effect of melatonin against hyperglycemia-induced alterations in the amyloidogenic pathway. High concentration of glucose was used to induce hyperglycemia in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. We found that 30 mM glucose affected the expression of insulin receptors and glucose transporters, which indicated the disruption of glucose sensing. High glucose induced the activation of the phosphorylated protein kinase B (pAkt)/GSK-3β signaling pathway and a significant increase in the expression of β-site beta APP cleaving enzyme (BACE1), presenilin1 (PS1) and Aβ42. Pretreatment with melatonin significantly reversed these parameters. We also showed that these effects are similar to those effects in the presence of the GSK-3β blocker, N-(4-methoxybenyl)-N'-(5-nitro-1,3-thiazol-2-yl) urea (ARA) in glucose-treated hyperglycemic cells. These suggested that melatonin exerted an inhibitory effect on the activation of APP-cleaving enzymes via the GSK-3β signaling pathway. Pretreatment with luzindole, a melatonin receptor MT1 antagonist, significantly prevented the effect of melatonin on the glucose-induced increase level of APP processing enzymes. This suggested that melatonin attenuated the toxic effect on hyperglycemia involving the amyloidogenic pathway partially mediated via melatonin receptor. Taken together the present results suggested that melatonin has a beneficial role in preventing Aβ generation in a cellular model of hyperglycemia-induced DM.","1573-6903","Neurochemical research","(47) 2568-2579",2022,"Chutikorn","Nopparat","C","Research Center for Neuroscience, Institute of Molecular Biosciences, Mahidol University, Nakhon Pathom, Thailand."

33722254,"The influence of BACE1 on macrophage recruitment and activity in the injured peripheral nerve.","Following peripheral nerve injury, multiple cell types, including axons, Schwann cells, and macrophages, coordinate to promote nerve regeneration. However, this capacity for repair is limited, particularly in older populations, and current treatments are insufficient. A critical component of the regeneration response is the network of cell-to-cell signaling in the injured nerve microenvironment. Sheddases are expressed in the peripheral nerve and play a role in the regulation if this cell-to-cell signaling through cleavage of transmembrane proteins, enabling the regulation of multiple pathways through cis- and trans-cellular regulatory mechanisms. Enhanced axonal regeneration has been observed in mice with deletion of the sheddase beta-secretase (BACE1), a transmembrane aspartyl protease that has been studied in the context of Alzheimer's disease. BACE1 knockout (KO) mice display enhanced macrophage recruitment and activity following nerve injury, although it is unclear whether this plays a role in driving the enhanced axonal regeneration. Further, it is unknown by what mechanism(s) BACE1 increases macrophage recruitment and activity. BACE1 has many substrates, several of which are known to have immunomodulatory activity. This review will discuss current knowledge of the role of BACE1 and other sheddases in peripheral nerve regeneration and outline known immunomodulatory BACE1 substrates and what potential roles they could play in peripheral nerve regeneration. Currently, the literature suggests that BACE1 and substrates that are expressed by neurons and Schwann cells are likely to be more important for this process than those expressed by macrophages. More broadly, BACE1 may play a role as an effector of immunomodulation beyond the peripheral nerve.","1742-2094","Journal of neuroinflammation","(18) 71",2021,"John A","Fissel","JA","Department of Neurology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, The John G.

It is reported that TUFM expression is reduced in the brain of Alzheimer's disease (AD), suggesting that TUFM might play a role in the pathophysiology. In this study, we found that TUFM protein level was decreased in the hippocampus and cortex especially in the aged APP/PS1 mice, an animal model of AD. In HEK cells that stably express full-length human amyloid-β precursor protein (HEK-APP), TUFM knockdown or overexpression increased or reduced the protein levels of β-amyloid protein (Aβ) and β-amyloid converting enzyme 1 (BACE1), respectively. TUFM-mediated reduction of BACE1 was attenuated by translation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX) or α-[2-[4-(3,4-Dichlorophenyl)-2-thiazolyl]hydrazinylidene]-2-nitro-benzenepropanoic acid (4EGI1), and in cells overexpressing BACE1 constructs deleting the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR). TUFM silencing increased the half-life of BACE1 mRNA, suggesting that RNA stability was affected by TUFM. In support, transcription inhibitor Actinomycin D (ActD) and silencing of nuclear factor κB (NFκB) failed to abolish TUFM-mediated regulation of BACE1 protein and mRNA. We further found that the mitochondria-targeted antioxidant TEMPO diminished the effects of TUFM on BACE1, suggesting that reactive oxygen species (ROS) played an important role. Indeed, cellular ROS levels were affected by TUFM knockdown or overexpression, and TUFM-mediated regulation of apoptosis and Tau phosphorylation at selective sites was attenuated by TEMPO. Collectively, TUFM protein levels were decreased in APP/PS1 mice.

In the present study, the regulatory mechanism of APP processing of three phlorotannins was elucidated in Swedish mutant APP overexpressed N2a (SweAPP N2a) cells. Among the tested compounds, dieckol exhibited the highest inhibitory effect on both intra- and extracellular Aβ accumulation. In addition, dieckol regulated the APP processing enzymes, such as α-secretase (ADAM10), β-secretase, and γ-secretase, presenilin-1 (PS1), and their proteolytic products, sAPPα and sAPPβ, implying that the compound acts on both the amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic pathways. In addition, dieckol increased the phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt) at Ser473 and GSK-3β at Ser9, suggesting dieckol induced the activation of Akt, which phosphorylated GSK-3β. The specific phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor LY294002 triggered GSK-3β activation and Aβ expression. In addition, co-treatment with LY294002 noticeably blocked the effect of dieckol on Aβ production, demonstrating that dieckol promoted the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which in turn inactivated GSK-3β, resulting in the reduction in Aβ levels.","1660-3397","Marine drugs","152",2021,"Jeong-Hyun","Yoon","JH","Department of Health Sciences, The graduate School of Dong-A University, Busan 49315, Korea."

Beta-amyloid (Aß) formation is considered one of the main reasons for Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. In our preliminary study, a series of microRNAs (miRs) with possible interaction with BACE1 and/or GSAP was selected using computational analysis. Our results showed that miR-4422-5p had a reduced level in the serum of AD patients. In this study, the effect of miR-4422-5p using miR-4422-5p mimic and inhibitor on BACE1 and GSAP were investigated, and a probable novel early diagnostic marker for AD was introduced. The effect of miR-4422-5p interaction with BACE1 and GSAP was evaluated via in vitro experiments using dual-luciferase assays, western blotting, and Immunocytochemistry. Luciferase assay demonstrated that miR-4422-5p mimic suppresses BACE1 and GSAP expression by directly targeting the 3'UTR of BACE1 and GSAP mRNA in HEK293T cells. Also, western blotting and immunocytochemistry confirmed the regulatory role of miR-4422-5p mimic on BACE1 and GSAP genes. miR-4422-5p mimic significantly decreased BACE1 and GSAP protein expression in SH-SY5Y and A549 cells, respectively. Moreover, miR-4422-5p-inhibitor reversed the expression processes in both cell lines.

Down's syndrome (DS) individuals are at increased risk to develop AD-type pathology; most DS individuals have developed substantial pathology already at the age of 40. DS individuals have an extra copy of chromosome 21, harbouring the amyloid precursor protein gene (APP). Our aim was to investigate the Aβ peptide pattern in DS and AD brains to investigate differences in their amyloid deposition and aggregation, respectively. Cortical tissue from patients with DS (with amyloid pathology), sporadic AD and controls were homogenized and fractionated into TBS (water soluble) and formic acid (water insoluble) fractions. Immunoprecipitation (IP) was performed using a variety of antibodies targeting different Aβ species including oligomeric Aβ. Mass spectrometry was then used to evaluate the presence of Aβ species in the different patient groups. A large number of Aβ peptides were identified including Aβ1-X, 2-X, 3-X, 4-X, 5-X, 11-X, and Aβ peptides extended N terminally of the BACE1 cleavage site and ending at amino 15 in the Aβ sequence APP/Aβ(-X to 15), as well as peptides post-translationally modified by pyroglutamate formation. Most Aβ peptides had higher abundance in AD and DS compared to controls, except the APP/Aβ(-X to 15) peptides which were most abundant in DS followed by controls and AD. Furthermore, the abundancies of AβX-40 and AβX-34 were increased in DS compared with AD. Aβ1-40, Aβ1-42, and Aβ4-42 were identified as the main constitutes of protofibrils (IP'd using mAb158) and higher relative Aβ1-42 signals were obtained compared with samples IP'd with 6E10 + 4G8, indicating that the protofibrils/oligomers were enriched with peptides ending at amino acid 42. All Aβ peptides found in AD were also present in DS indicating similar pathways of Aβ peptide production, degradation and accumulation, except for APP/Aβ(-X to 15). Likewise, the Aβ peptides forming protofibrils/oligomers in both AD and DS were similar, implying the possibility that treatment with clinical benefit in sporadic AD might also be beneficial for subjects with DS.","1872-7972","Neuroscience letters","(754) 135894",2021,"Eleni","Gkanatsiou","E","Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, the Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg, Gothenburg, Sweden.

Therefore, Aβ is strongly positioned as a promising and extensively validated therapeutic target for AD. Investigational disease-modifying approaches aiming at reducing cerebral Aβ concentrations include prevention of de novo production of Aβ through inhibition of β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), and clearance of Aβ deposits via passive Aβ immunotherapy.

Here, we describe the preclinical characterization of this antibody, and demonstrate a significant reduction in amyloid burden in the absence of microhemorrhages in different mouse models with established plaque deposition. Moreover, we combined antibody treatment with chronic BACE1 inhibitor treatment and demonstrate significant clearance of pre-existing amyloid deposits in transgenic mouse brain, without induction of microhemorrhages and other histopathological findings. Together, these data confirm significant potential for the 3pE-specific antibody to be developed as a passive immunotherapy approach that balances efficacy and safety.

MMPs have been associated with neurological conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), through a sudden and massive upregulation of particular members of the MMP family. Evidence for this hypothesis can be found in the clinical observation of increased MMP1 and MMP3 expression levels in plasma of AD patients compared to control individuals and in the pro-amyloidogenic effects that have been described for additional MMP family members like MMP13, MT1-MMP, and MT5-MMP. Consequently, we investigated the role of MMP1, 3, 13, MT1-MMP, and MT5-MMP in the genetic etiology of AD. We performed full exonic resequencing of these 5 MMPs in 1278 AD patients (mean age at onset [AAO]: 74.88 ± 9.10, range: 29-96) and 797 age-matched control individuals (mean age at inclusion [AAI]: 74.92 ± 6.48, range: 65-100) from Flanders-Belgium and identified MMP13 as most promising candidate gene. We identified 6 ultra-rare (≤0.01%) MMP13 missense mutations in 6 patients that were absent from the control cohort. We observed in one control individual a frameshift mutation (p.G269Qfs*2) leading to a premature termination codon. Based on previously described functional evidence, suggesting that MMP13 regulates BACE1 processing, and our genetic findings, we hypothesize a gain-of-function disease mechanism for the missense mutations found in patients. Functional experimental studies remain essential to assess the effect of these mutations on disease related processes and genetic replication studies are needed to corroborate our findings.","1558-1497","Neurobiology of aging","(104) 105.e1-105.e6",2021,"Julie","Hoogmartens","J","Neurodegenerative Brain Diseases Group, VIB Center for Molecular Neurology, Antwerp, Belgium; Institute Born-Bunge, Antwerp, Belgium; Department of Biomedical Sciences, University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium."

HMGB1 mediated TLR4/RAGE cascade has been scored as a key culprit in neuroinflammatory signalling that critically evokes development of impaired cognition and epilepsy.

PTZ was intraperitoneally injected 35 mg/kg, every 48 h, for 14 doses, to evoke kindling model. Phenytoin (30 mg/kg, i.p.) and PTX (60 mg/kg, i.p.) or their combination were given once daily for 27 days. PTX treatment showed a statistically significant effect on behavioural, histopathological and neurochemical analysis. PTX protected the PTZ kindling rats from epileptic seizures and improved memory and cognitive impairment through the Morris water maze (MWM) test. Furthermore, PTX reversed PTZ hippocampal neuronal loss by decreasing protein expression of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ), Tau and β site-amyloid precursor protein cleavage enzyme 1 (BACE1), associated with a marked reduction in expression of inflammatory mediators such as HMGB1, TL4, and RAGE proteins. Furthermore, PTX inhibited hippocampal apoptotic caspase 1 protein, total reactive oxygen species (TROS) along with upregulated erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) content.

33929845,"Formation of Supported Lipid Bilayers Derived from Vesicles of Various Compositional Complexity on Conducting Polymer/Silica Substrates.","Supported lipid bilayers (SLBs) serve important roles as minimalistic models of cellular membranes in multiple diagnostic and pharmaceutical applications as well as in the strive to gain fundamental insights about their complex biological function. To further expand the utility of SLBs, there is a need to go beyond simple lipid compositions to thereby better mimic the complexity of native cell membranes, while simultaneously retaining their compatibility with a versatile range of analytical platforms. To meet this demand, we have in this work explored SLB formation on PEDOT:PSS/silica nanoparticle composite films and mesoporous silica films, both capable of transporting ions to an underlying conducting PEDOT:PSS film. The SLB formation process was evaluated by using the quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) monitoring, total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) for membranes made of pure synthetic lipids with or without the reconstituted membrane protein β-secretase 1 (BACE1) as well as cell-derived native lipid vesicles containing overexpressed BACE1. The mesoporous silica thin film was superior to the PEDOT:PSS/silica nanoparticle composite, providing successful formation of bilayers with high lateral mobility and low defect density even for the most complex native cell membranes.","1520-5827","Langmuir : the ACS journal of surfaces and colloids","(37) 5494-5505",2021,"Hanna","Ulmefors","H","Division of Nano and Biological Physics, Department of Physics, Chalmers University of Technology, 412 96 Gothenburg, Sweden."

Inhibiting Tau protein and amyloid-beta (Aβ) production or removing these molecules is considered potential therapeutic strategies for AD. Genipin is an aglycone and is isolated from the extract of Gardenia jasminoides Ellis fruit. In this study, the effect and molecular mechanisms of genipin on the inhibition of Tau aggregation and Aβ generation were investigated. The results showed that genipin bound to Tau and protected against heparin-induced Tau fibril formation. Moreover, genipin suppressed Tau phosphorylation probably by downregulating the expression of CDK5 and GSK-3β, and activated mTOR-dependent autophagy via the SIRT1/LKB1/AMPK signaling pathway in Tau-overexpressing cells. In addition, genipin decreased Aβ production by inhibiting BACE1 expression through the PERK/eIF2α signaling pathway in N2a/SweAPP cells. These data indicated that genipin could effectively lead to a significant reduction of phosphorylated Tau level and Aβ generation in vitro, suggesting that genipin might be developed into an effective therapeutic complement or a potential nutraceutical for preventing AD.","1559-1182","Molecular neurobiology","(58) 4134-4144",2021,"Meiting","Li","M","Shenzhen Key Laboratory of Marine Bioresources and Ecology, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory for Plant Epigenetics, College of Life Sciences and Oceanography, Shenzhen University, Shenzhen, 518060, People's Republic of China."

Chronic treatment with clemastine orally reduced amyloid-β (Aβ) load, neuroinflammation and cognitive deficits of APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Clemastine decreases Aβ generation via reducing the levels of BACE1, CTFs of APP. Mechanistically, clemastine enhances autophagy concomitant with a suppression of mTOR signaling.

Many patients with HF experience cardiogenic dementia, yet the pathophysiology of this disease remains poorly understood. Using a swine model of cardiometabolic HF (Western diet+aortic banding; WD-AB), we tested the hypothesis that WD-AB would promote a multidementia phenotype involving cerebrovascular dysfunction alongside evidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. The results provide evidence of cerebrovascular insufficiency coupled with neuroinflammation and amyloidosis in swine with experimental cardiometabolic HF. Although cardiac ejection fraction was normal, indices of arterial compliance and cerebral blood flow were reduced, and cerebrovascular regulation was impaired in the WD-AB group. Cerebrovascular dysfunction occurred concomitantly with increased MAPK signaling and amyloidogenic processing (i.e., increased APP, BACE1, CTF, and Aβ40 in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus) in the WD-AB group. Transcriptomic profiles of the stellate ganglia revealed the WD-AB group displayed an enrichment of gene networks associated with MAPK/ERK signaling, AD, frontotemporal dementia, and a number of behavioral phenotypes implicated in cognitive impairment. These provide potentially novel evidence from a swine model that cerebrovascular and neuronal pathologies likely both contribute to the dementia profile in a setting of cardiometabolic HF.","2379-3708","JCI insight","10.1172/jci.insight.143141",2021,"Bradley J","Baranowski","BJ","Department of Health Sciences and."
34029592,"The aminosterol Claramine inhibits β-secretase 1-mediated insulin receptor cleavage.","The cleavage of the insulin receptor by β-secretase 1 (BACE1) in the liver increases during diabetes, which contributes to reduce insulin receptor levels and impair insulin signaling. However, the precise signaling events that lead to this increased cleavage are unclear. We showed that BACE1 cleaves the insulin receptor in the early secretory pathway. Indeed, coimmunoprecipitation experiments reveal the interaction of the proforms of the two proteins. Moreover, fragments of insulin receptor are detected in the early secretory pathway and a mutated form of BACE1 that retains its prodomain cleaves an early secretory pathway-resident form of the insulin receptor. We showed that BACE1 proform levels are regulated by proteasome and/or lysosome-dependent degradation systems whose efficiencies are dependent on the O-GlcNacylation process. Our results showed that enhanced O-GlcNacylation reduces the efficiency of intracellular protein degradation systems, leading to the accumulation of the proform of BACE1 in the early secretory pathway where it cleaves the precursor of the insulin receptor. All these dysregulations are found in the livers of diabetic mice. In addition, we performed a screen of molecules according to their ability to increase levels of the insulin receptor at the surface of BACE1-overexpressing cells. This approach identified the aminosterol Claramine, which accelerated intracellular trafficking of the proform of BACE1 and increased autophagy. Both of these effects likely contribute to the reduced amount of the proform of BACE1 in the early secretory pathway, thereby reducing insulin receptor cleavage. These newly described properties of Claramine are consistent with its insulin sensitizing effect.","1083-351X","The Journal of biological chemistry","(297) 100818",2021,"Bénédicte","Gaborit","B","INSERM, INRAE, C2VN, Aix Marseille University, Marseille, France; Endocrinology, Metabolic Diseases and Nutrition Department, APHM, Marseille, France."

To efficiently deliver CRISPR-chem drugs into brain lesions, traceable nano-biohybrid complexes (F-TBIO) are constructed by one-step synthesis and CRISPR/Cas9 plasmids (CF-TBIO) are loaded in a controllable manner. CF-TBIO can knock out the BACE1 gene and reduce the burden of amyloid-β, and thereby significantly improve the cognitive abilities of 2xTg-AD mice. In particular, by prolonging the dosing interval, the pathological damage and behavioral abilities of 2xTg-AD mice are still significantly improved. During the therapeutic process, CF-TBIO with a high relaxation rate provides accurate imaging signals in the complex brain physiological environment.

Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is a drug used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and has shown a neuroprotective effect against other neurodegenerative diseases. Accordingly, the present study aimed to evaluate the effect of DMF on an experimental model of Alzheimer disease (AD) using D-galactose (D-Gal) administered to ovariectomized (OVX) rats, resembling a postmenopausal dementia paradigm. Adult 18-month old female Wistar rats were allocated into sham-operated and OVX/D-Gal groups that were either left untreated or treated with DMF for 56 days starting three weeks after sham-operation or ovariectomy. DMF succeeded to ameliorate cognitive (learning/short- and long-term memory) deficits and to enhance the dampened overall activity (NOR, Barnes-/Y-maze tests). These behavioral upturns were associated with increased intact neurons (Nissl stain) and a reduction in OVX/D-Gal-mediated hippocampal CA1 neurodegeneration and astrocyte activation assessed as GFAP immunoreactivity. Mechanistically, DMF suppressed the hippocampal contents of AD-surrogate markers; viz., apolipoprotein (APO)-E1, BACE1, Aβ42, and hyperphosphorylated Tau. Additionally, DMF has augmented the neuroprotective parameters p-AKT, its downstream target CREB and BDNF. Besides, it activated AMPK, and enhanced SIRT-1, as well as antioxidant defenses (SOD, GSH). On the other hand, DMF inhibited the transcription factor NF-κB, IL-1β, adiponectin/adiponectin receptor type (AdipoR)1, GSK-3β, and MDA. Accordingly, in this postmenopausal AD model, DMF treatment by pursuing the adiponectin/AdipoR1, AMPK/SIRT-1, AKT/CREB/BDNF, AKT/GSK-3β, and APO-E1 quartet hampered the associated tauo-/amyloidopathy and NF-κB-mediated oxidative/inflammatory responses to advance insights into its anti-amnesic effect.","1872-9754","Neurochemistry international","(148) 105082",2021,"Israa M","Abd El-Fatah","IM","Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo University, Κasr El-Aini Str, 11562, Cairo, Egypt."

Recently, it was shown that overexpression of PGC1α resulted in reduced amyloid-β (Aβ) generation, particularly by regulating the expression of BACE1, the rate-limiting enzyme involved in the production of Aβ. These results provide evidence pointing toward PGC1α activation as a new therapeutic avenue for AD, which has been supported by the promising observations of treatments with drugs that enhance the expression of PGC1α and gene therapy studies in animal models of AD.

The cognitive function, amyloid-β (Aβ) plaques, Aβ deposition areas and levels of Aβ1-42, Aβ decomposition-related factors (NEP and IDE), and inflammatory cytokines in BM-MSC-EVs-treated AD rats were measured. The effect of BM-MSC-EVs was studied in AD neuron model. microRNA (miR)-29c-3p and BACE1 expression, as well as levels of Wnt/β-catenin pathway-related factors in AD and EVs-treated AD models were detected. miR-29c-3p relationship with BACE1 was predicted and confirmed. miR-29c-3p and BACE1 were interfered to verify the mechanism of EVs in AD. The Wnt/β-catenin pathway inhibitor DKK1 was further added to EVs-treated AD neurons. BM-MSC-EVs showed therapeutic effects on AD rats and neurons. BM-MSC-EVs carried miR-29c-3p into AD neurons. miR-29c-3p targeted BACE1.

BACE1 enzyme is essential for the generation of Aβ. Deficiency of p38α-MAPK in neurons increases lysosomal degradation of BACE1 and decreases Aβ deposition in the brain of APP-transgenic mice. However, the mechanisms mediating effects of p38α-MAPK are largely unknown. In this study, we used APP-transgenic mice and cultured neurons and observed that deletion of p38α-MAPK specifically in neurons decreased phosphorylation of Snapin at serine, increased retrograde transportation of BACE1 in axons and reduced BACE1 at synaptic terminals, which suggests that p38α-MAPK deficiency promotes axonal transportation of BACE1 from its predominant locations, axonal terminals, to lysosomes in the cell body. In vitro kinase assay revealed that p38α-MAPK directly phosphorylates Snapin. By further performing mass spectrometry analysis and site-directed mutagenic experiments in SH-SY5Y cell lines, we identified serine residue 112 as a p38α-MAPK-phosphorylating site on Snapin. Replacement of serine 112 with alanine did abolish p38α-MAPK knockdown-induced reduction of BACE1 activity and protein level, and transportation to lysosomes in SH-SY5Y cells. Taken together, our study suggests that activation of p38α-MAPK phosphorylates Snapin and inhibits the retrograde transportation of BACE1 in axons, which might exaggerate amyloid pathology in AD brain.","1530-6860","FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology","(35) e21691",2021,"Laura","Schnöder","L","Department of Neurology, Saarland University, Homburg/Saar, Germany."

We show that BACE1 is required for optimal release of synaptic vesicles. BACE1 deficiency or inhibition decreases synaptic vesicle docking in the synaptic active zones. Consistently, BACE1-null mice or mice treated with clinically tested BACE1 inhibitors Verubecestat and Lanabecestat exhibit severe reduction in hippocampal LTP and learning behaviors. To counterbalance this synaptic deficit, we discovered that BACE1-null mice treated with positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (mGluR1), whose levels were reduced in BACE1-null mice and significantly improved long-term potentiation and cognitive behaviors. Similarly, mice treated with mGluR1 PAM showed significantly mitigated synaptic deficits caused by BACE1 inhibitors.

Delta-secretase binds BACE1 and cuts it at N294 residue in an age-dependent manner and elevates its protease activity. The cleaved N-terminal motif is active even under neutral pH and associates with senile plaques in human AD brains. Subcellular fractionation reveals that delta-secretase and BACE1 reside in the endo-lysosomes. Interestingly, truncated BACE1 enzymatic domain (1-294) augments delta-secretase enzymatic activity and accelerates Aβ production, facilitating AD pathologies and cognitive impairments in APP/PS1 AD mouse model. Uncleavable BACE1 (N294A) inhibits delta-secretase activity and Aβ production and decreases AD pathologies in 5XFAD mice, ameliorating cognitive dysfunctions.

Amber extract also decreased β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and increased microtubule-associated proteins 1A/1B light chain 3B (LC3II) and Beclin 1. These findings suggested that amber extract protects neuronal cells against Aβ (1-42)-induced cell apoptosis by upregulating autophagy and downregulating BACE1.","1950-6007","Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie","(141) 111804",2021,"Yuening","Luo","Y","Graduate School of Life and Environmental Sciences, University of Tsukuba, Tsukuba, Ibaraki 305-8572, Japan."

In the current work, multiple replica Gaussian accelerated molecular dynamics (MR-GaMD) simulations and the molecular mechanics general Born surface area (MM-GBSA) method were combined to investigate the effect of pH-dependent protonation on the binding of the inhibitors CS9, C6U, and 6WE to BACE1. Dynamic analyses based on the MR-GaMD trajectory show that pH-dependent protonation strongly affects the structural flexibility, correlated motions, and dynamic behavior of inhibitor-bound BACE1. According to the constructed free energy profiles, in the protonated state at low pH, inhibitor-bound BACE1 tends to populate at more conformations than in high pH. The binding free energies calculated by MM-GBSA suggest that inhibitors possess stronger binding abilities under the protonation conditions at high pH than under the protonation conditions at low pH. Moreover, pH-dependent protonation exerts a significant effect on the hydrogen bonding interactions of CS9, C6U, and 6WE to BACE1, which correspondingly alters the binding abilities of the three inhibitors to BACE1. Furthermore, in different protonated environments, three inhibitors share common interaction clusters and similar binding sites in BACE1, which are reliably used as efficient targets for the design of potent inhibitors of BACE1.","1948-7193","ACS chemical neuroscience","(12) 2591-2607",2021,"Jianzhong","Chen","J","School of Science, Shandong Jiaotong University, Jinan 250357, China."

Dysfunctional membrane trafficking contributes to aberrant Aβ production and Alzheimer's disease. Endosomes represent one of the major sites for Aβ production and recently the Golgi has re-emerged also as a major location for amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and Aβ production. Based on recent findings, here we propose that APP processing in the Golgi is finely tuned by segregating newly-synthesised APP and the β-secretase BACE1 within the Golgi and into distinct trans-Golgi network transport pathways. We hypothesise that there are multiple mechanisms responsible for segregating APP and BACE1 during transit through the Golgi, and that perturbation in Golgi morphology associated with Alzheimer's disease, and or changes in cholesterol metabolism associated with Alzheimer's disease risk factors, may lead to a loss of partitioning and enhanced Aβ production.","1600-0854","Traffic (Copenhagen, Denmark)","(22) 319-327",2021,"Lou","Fourriere","L","The Department of Biochemistry and Pharmacology and Bio21 Molecular Science and Biotechnology Institute, The University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Victoria, Australia."

These properties make trehalose an interesting therapeutic candidate against proteinopathies such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is characterized by deposits of aggregated amyloid-beta (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau. In this study, we observed that trehalose was able to induce autophagy in neurons only in the short-term, whereas long-term treatment with trehalose provoked a relevant anti-amyloidogenic effect in neurons from an AD mouse model that was not mediated by autophagy. Trehalose treatment reduced secreted Aβ levels in a manner unrelated to its intracellular accumulation or its elimination through endocytosis or enzymatic degradation. Moreover, the levels of Aβ precursor protein (APP) and beta-secretase (BACE1) remained unaltered, as well as the proper acidic condition of the endo-lysosome system. Instead, our results support that the neuroprotective effect of trehalose was mediated by a reduced colocalization of APP and BACE1 in the cell, and, therefore, a lower amyloidogenic processing of APP. This observation illustrates that the determination of the mechanism, or mechanisms, that associate APP and BACE is a relevant therapeutic target to investigate.","2218-1989","Metabolites","421",2021,"Irene","Benito-Cuesta","I","Centro de Biología Molecular ""Severo Ochoa"" (CSIC-UAM), Universidad Autónoma de Madrid, 28049 Madrid, Spain."

METH use is associated with cognitive impairments and neurochemical abnormalities comparable to pathological changes observed in Alzheimer's disease (AD). These observations have stimulated the idea that METH abusers might be prone to develop AD-like signs and symptoms. Melatonin, the pineal hormone, is considered as a potential therapeutic intervention against AD. We thus conducted the present study to explore potential protective roles of melatonin against METH-induced deficits in learning and memory as well as in the appearance of AD-like pathological changes in METH-treated male Wistar rats. We found that melatonin ameliorated METH-induced cognitive impairments in those rats. Melatonin prevented METH-induced decrease in dopamine transporter (DAT) expression in rat hippocampus. Melatonin reversed METH-induced activation of β-arrestin2, reduction of phosphorylation of protein kinase B (Akt) and METH-induced excessive activity of glycogen synthase kinase-3β (GSK3β). Importantly, melatonin inhibited METH-induced changes in the expression of β-site APP cleaving enzyme (BACE1), disintegrin and metalloproteinase 10 (ADAM10), and presenilin 1 (PS1), as well as the reduction of amyloid beta (Aβ)42 production. Immunofluorescence double-labeling demonstrated that melatonin not only prevented the METH-induced loss of DAT but also prevented METH-induced Aβ42 overexpression in the dentate gyrus, CA1, and CA3.

Changes in terminal sialylation and fucosylation of asparagine (N)-linked glycans have been documented in COPD, but the role that glycosyltransferases may play in the regulation of N-linked glycans in COPD has not been fully elucidated. Recent studies suggest that modulation of ST6GAL1 (ST6 beta-galactoside alpha-2,6-sialyltransferase-1), which catalyzes terminal α2-6 sialylation of cellular proteins, may regulate inflammation and contribute to COPD phenotype(s). Interestingly, it has been previously demonstrated that ST6GAL1, a Golgi resident protein, can be proteolytically processed by BACE1 (beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme-1) to a circulating form that retains activity. In this study, we showed that loss of ST6GAL1 expression increased interleukin (IL)-6 expression and secretion in human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs). Furthermore, exposure to cigarette smoke medium/extract (CSE) or BACE1 inhibition resulted in decreased ST6GAL1 secretion, reduced α2-6 sialylation, and increased IL-6 production in HBECs. Analysis of plasma ST6GAL1 levels in a small COPD patient cohort demonstrated an inverse association with prospective acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD), while IL-6 was positively associated. Altogether, these results suggest that reduced ST6GAL1 and α2-6 sialylation augments IL-6 expression/secretion in HBECs and is associated with poor clinical outcomes in COPD.","1664-3224","Frontiers in immunology","(12) 693149",2021,"Stefanie","Krick","S","Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Critical Care Medicine, Department of Medicine, The University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, United States."

Clinical trials using BACE inhibitors have reported a lack of positive effect on patient symptoms and, in some cases, have led to increased adverse events, cognitive worsening and hippocampal atrophy. A potential drawback of this strategy is the effect of BACE inhibition on other BACE1 substrates such as Seizure-related gene 6 (Sez6) family proteins which are known to have a role in neuronal function. Mice were treated with an in-diet BACE inhibitor for 4-8 weeks to achieve a clinically-relevant level of amyloid-β40 reduction in the brain. Mice underwent behavioural testing and postmortem analysis of dendritic spine number and morphology with Golgi-Cox staining. Sez6 family triple knockout mice were tested alongside wild-type mice to identify whether any effects of the treatment were due to altered cleavage of Sez6 family proteins. Wild-type mice treated with BACE inhibitor displayed hyperactivity on the elevated open field, as indicated by greater distance travelled, but this effect was not observed in treated Sez6 triple knockout mice. BACE inhibitor treatment did not lead to significant changes in spatial or fear learning, reference memory, cognitive flexibility or anxiety in mice as assessed by the Morris water maze, context fear conditioning, or light-dark box tests. Chronic BACE inhibitor treatment reduced the density of mushroom-type spines in the somatosensory cortex, regardless of genotype, but did not affect steady-state dendritic spine density or morphology in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Chronic BACE inhibition for 1-2 months in mice led to increased locomotor output but did not alter memory or cognitive flexibility. While the mechanism underlying the treatment-induced hyperactivity is unknown, the absence of this response in Sez6 triple knockout mice indicates that blocking ectodomain shedding of Sez6 family proteins is a contributing factor. In contrast, the decrease in mature spine density in cortical neurons was not attributable to lack of shed Sez6 family protein ectodomains. Therefore, other BACE1 substrates are implicated in this effect and, potentially, in the cognitive decline in longer-term chronically treated patients.","2045-2322","Scientific reports","(11) 15084",2021,"A","Nash","A","Department of Anatomy and Physiology, University of Melbourne, Melbourne, VIC, Australia."

To determine the mechanism of HIV-1 gp120-induced memory dysfunction, we performed mouse intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusion with HIV-1 gp120 protein (300 ng per mouse) and investigated memory impairment and amyloidogenesis. Infusion of the HIV-1 gp120 protein induced memory dysfunction, which was evaluated using passive avoidance and water maze tests. Infusion of HIV-1 gp120 induced neuroinflammation, such as the release of iNOS and COX-2 and the activation of astrocytes and microglia and increased the mRNA and protein levels of IL-6, ICAM-1, M-CSF, TIM, and IL-2. In particular, we found that the infusion of HIV-1 gp120 induced the accumulation of amyloid plaques and signs of elevated amyloidogenesis, such as increased expression of amyloid precursor protein and BACE1 and increased β-secretase activity. Therefore, these studies suggest that HIV-1 gp120 may induce memory impairment through Aβ accumulation and neuroinflammation.","1976-3786","Archives of pharmacal research","(44) 689-701",2021,"Young-Jung","Lee","YJ","Department of Equine Resources Science, School of Equine and Horticultural, Cheju Halla University, 38 Halladaehak-ro, Jeju-si, Jeju Special Self-Governing Province, 63092, Republic of Korea."

Similarly, the production of Aβ and tau hyperphosphorylation was also detected in HT-22 cells treated with MC-LR. In addition, MC-LR promoted increased expressions of BACE1 and PS1, but reduced mRNA expressions of ADAM family members both in vivo and in vitro, promoting the Aβ production. Moreover, we identified Akt/GSK-3β signal pathway mediated the Aβ and p-tau accumulation, bringing about Alzheimer's disease-like changes. Furthermore, microglial cells were activated in those mice exposed to MC-LR. Inflammatory cytokines were also found being activated to release in vitro. In conclusion, this study could provide a clue for MC-LR-induced neurotoxicity, which gave insights into the environmental risks of Alzheimer's disease.","1879-1026","The Science of the total environment","(794) 148732",2021,"Yuhan","Ma","Y","Immunology and Reproduction Biology Laboratory & State Key Laboratory of Analytical Chemistry for Life Science, Medical School, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093, China; Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Molecular Medicine, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093, China."

Recently, the membrane-type 5 matrix metalloproteinase (MT5-MMP/MMP-24), mainly expressed in the nervous system, has been highlighted as a new key player in APP-processing, able to stimulate amyloidogenesis and also to generate a neurotoxic APP derivative. In addition, the loss of MT5-MMP has been demonstrated to abrogate pathological hallmarks in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease (AD), thus shedding light on MT5-MMP as an attractive new therapeutic target. However, a more comprehensive analysis of the role of MT5-MMP is necessary to evaluate how its targeting affects neurons and glia in pathological and physiological situations. In this study, leveraging on CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing strategy, we established cultures of human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC)-derived neurons and astrocytes to investigate the impact of MT5-MMP deficiency on their phenotypes. We found that MT5-MMP-deficient neurons exhibited an increased number of primary and secondary neurites, as compared to isogenic hiPSC-derived neurons.

Here we show the consequences of two coding variants in BIN1 (rs754834233 and rs138047593), both in terms of intracellular beta-amyloid (iAbeta) accumulation and early endosome enlargement, two interrelated early cytopathological AD phenotypes, supporting their association with LOAD risk. We previously found that Bin1 deficiency potentiates iAbeta production by enabling BACE1 cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein in enlarged early endosomes due to decreased BACE1 recycling. Here, we discovered that the expression of the two LOAD mutant forms of Bin1 does not rescue the iAbeta accumulation and early endosome enlargement induced by Bin1 knockdown and recovered by wild-type Bin1. Moreover, the overexpression of Bin1 mutants, but not wild-type Bin1, increased the iAbeta42 fragment by reducing the recycling of BACE1, which accumulated in early endosomes, recapitulating the phenotype of Bin1 knockdown. We showed that the mutations in Bin1 reduced its interaction with BACE1. The endocytic recycling of transferrin was similarly affected, indicating that Bin1 is a general regulator of endocytic recycling. These data demonstrate that the LOAD-coding variants in Bin1 lead to a loss of function in endocytic recycling, which may be an early causal mechanism of LOAD.","1083-351X","The Journal of biological chemistry","(297) 101056",2021,"Catarina","Perdigão","C","iNOVA4Health, CEDOC, NOVA Medical School, NMS, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal."

BACE1 and γ-secretase activities were not directly affected by c9,t11 CLA. Localization of BACE1 and APP in early endosomes increased in neurons treated with c9,t11 CLA; concomitantly, the localization of both proteins was reduced in late endosomes, the predominant site of APP cleavage by BACE1. The level of CLA-containing phosphatidylcholine (CLA-PC) increased dramatically in neurons incubated with CLA.

Thus, in neurons treated with c9,t11 CLA, reduced colocalization of APP with BACE1 in late endosomes may decrease APP cleavage by BACE1 and subsequent Aβ generation. Our findings suggest that the accumulation of c9,t11 CLA-PC/LPC in neuronal membranes suppresses the production of neurotoxic Aβ in neurons.","1471-4159","Journal of neurochemistry","(159) 603-617",2021,"Saori","Hata","S","Biomedical Research Institute, National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology (AIST), Tsukuba, Japan."
34402286,"[An integrative metabolomics and network pharmacology method for exploring bioactive components and preliminary pharmacodynamics in medicinal parts of Harrisonia perforata].","In this paper,metabolomics and network pharmacology were used to investigate the bioactive components of Harrisonia perforata and their possible mechanisms of action. Metabolites in the flowers,fruits,branches,leaves and stalks of H. perforata were analyzed by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Meanwhile,multiple statistical analysis methods including principal component analysis( PCA) and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis( OPLS-DA)were applied to screen and identify differential compounds. With metabolomics method,9 differential compounds were preliminarily identified from leaves and other non-traditional medicinal parts. Subsequently,these compounds were explored by using network pharmacology. With gastrointestinal absorption and drug-likeness as limiting conditions,they were imported into the Swiss ADME,from which 7 compounds with potential medicinal activity were obtained. Then,their targets were predicted by PharmMapper,with Human Protein Targets Only and Normalized Fit Score&gt;0. 9 set as limiting conditions,and 60 standardized potential targets were identified with Uniprot. KEGG( Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes) pathway data was obtained using metascape and the &quot; potential active ingredients-target-pathway&quot; network was constructed with Cytoscape 3. 7. 2. The enrichment analysis of KEGG demonstrated that the 60 targets were enriched in 78 signaling pathways( min overlap: 3,P value cutoff: 0. 01,min enrichment: 1. 5),many of which are related to anti-bacteria,anti-inflammation and anti-virus,such as IL-17 signaling pathway,RIG-I-like receptor signaling pathway and NOD-like receptor signaling pathway. Finally,depending on the clinical activity of H. perforata,the relevant signaling pathways were analyzed through experimental data and literature. Dehydroconiferyl alcohol was reported to have the anti-inflammatory effect and perforamone D to possess the antimycobacterial activity. The KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that dehydroconiferyl alcohol could act on the Alzheimer&apos;s disease( AD) signaling pathway by targeting CDK5 R1 and BACE1. ACh E inhibitor is the most promising drug to treat AD,while dehydroconiferyl alcohol has been proved to inhibit ACh E according to literature. The experimental results revealed that the extract of leaves of H. perforata can effectively inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus aureus. These are consistent with the enrichment analysis results of KEGG. This study explored the bioactive components and pharmacodynamics of the leaves of the H. perforata,laying a theoretical foundation for its in-depth development and rational application.","1001-5302","Zhongguo Zhong yao za zhi = Zhongguo zhongyao zazhi = China journal of Chinese materia medica","(46) 3625-3632",2021,"Xin-Meng","Wang","XM","Chengdu Institute of Biology,Chinese Academy of Sciences Chengdu 610041,China University of Chinese Academy of Sciences Beijing 100049,China."

Besides, mitochondrial fission is increased in response to hypoxia. In this study, we sought to investigate whether hypoxia-induced mitochondrial fission plays a critical role in regulating amyloid-β (Aβ) production. Hypoxia significantly activated extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), increased phosphorylation of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) at serine 616, and decreased phosphorylation of Drp1 at serine 637. Importantly, hypoxia triggered mitochondrial dysfunction, elevated β-secretase 1 (BACE1) and γ-secretase activities, and promoted Aβ accumulation in HEK293 cells transfected with β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) plasmid harboring the Swedish and Indiana familial Alzheimer's disease mutations (APPSwe/Ind HEK293 cells). Then, we investigated whether the ERK inhibitor PD325901 and Drp1 inhibitor mitochondrial division inhibitor-1 (Mdivi-1) would attenuate hypoxia-induced mitochondrial fission and Aβ generation in APPSwe/Ind HEK293 cells. PD325901 and Mdivi-1 inhibited phosphorylation of Drp1 at serine 616, resulting in reduced mitochondrial fission under hypoxia. Furthermore, hypoxia-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, BACE1 activation, and Aβ accumulation were downregulated by PD325901 and Mdivi-1. Our data demonstrate that hypoxia induces mitochondrial fission, impairs mitochondrial function, and facilitates Aβ generation. The ERK-Drp1 signaling pathway is partly involved in the hypoxia-induced Aβ generation by regulating mitochondrial fission and BACE1 activity. Therefore, inhibition of hypoxia-induced mitochondrial fission may prevent or slow the progression of AD.","2211-5463","FEBS open bio","(11) 2740-2755",2021,"Yuan","Yuan","Y","Department of Neurology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People's Hospital, China."

In this study, we investigated the role of sulfuretin in the processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP), in association with the two catalytic enzymes the α-secretase a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM10), and the beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) that play important roles in the generation of β amyloid protein (Aβ) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We found that sulfuretin increased the levels of the immature but not the mature form of ADAM10 protein. The enhanced ADAM10 transcription by sulfuretin was mediated by the nucleotides -444 to -300 in the promoter region, and was attenuated by silencing or mutation of transcription factor retinoid X receptor (RXR) and by GW6471, a specific inhibitor of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPAR-α). We further found that sulfuretin preferentially increased protein levels of the immature form of APP (im-APP) but significantly reduced those of BACE1, sAPPβ and β-CTF, whereas Aβ1-42 levels were slightly increased. Finally, the effect of sulfuretin on BACE1 and im-APP was selectively attenuated by the translation inhibitor cycloheximide and by lysosomal inhibitor chloroquine, respectively. Taken together, (1) RXR/PPAR-α signaling was involved in sulfuretin-mediated ADAM10 transcription. (2) Alteration of Aβ protein level by sulfuretin was not consistent with that of ADAM10 and BACE1 protein levels, but was consistent with the elevated level of im-APP protein, suggesting that im-APP, an isoform mainly localized to trans-Golgi network, plays an important role in Aβ generation.","2352-3042","Genes & diseases","(8) 867-881",2021,"Jian","Chen","J","Department of Neurology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing Key Laboratory of Neurology, 1 Youyi Road, Chongqing, 400016, PR China."

We recently reported that LMTK1 regulates axon outgrowth, dendrite arborization and spine formation via Rab11-mediated vesicle transport. Rab11, a small GTPase regulating recycling endosome trafficking, is shown to be associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). In fact, genome-wide association studies identified many proteins regulating vesicle transport as risk factors for LOAD. Furthermore, LMTK1 has been reported to be a risk factor for frontotemporal dementia. Then, we hypothesized that LMTK1 contributes to AD development through vesicle transport and examined the effect of LMTK1 on the cellular localization of AD-related proteins, amyloid precursor protein (APP) and β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1). The β-cleavage of APP by BACE1 is the initial and rate-limiting step in Aβ generation. We found that LMTK1 accumulated BACE1, but not APP, to the perinuclear endosomal compartment, whereas the kinase-negative(kn) mutant of LMTK1A did not. The β-C-terminal fragment was prone to increase under overexpression of LMTK1A kn. Moreover, the expression level of LMTK1A was reduced in AD brains. These results suggest the possibility that LMTK1 is involved in AD development through the regulation of the proper endosomal localization of BACE1.","1756-2651","Journal of biochemistry","(170) 729-738",2022,"Keisuke","Komaki","K",""
34527417,"Astrocytes & Astrocyte derived Extracellular Vesicles in Morphine Induced Amyloidopathy: Implications for Cognitive Deficits in Opiate Abusers.","While opiates like morphine play a major role in the pharmacotherapy for the control of pain associated with various diseases, paradoxically, their long-term use is associated with cognitive impairments. Furthermore, morphine administration has been shown to result in neuronal synaptodendritic injury in rodent brains, leading to neurodegeneration. We recently reported the role of astrocytes as contributors of amyloidosis associated with HIV-associated neurological disorders. Herein we hypothesize that morphine could induce astrocytic amyloidosis, which, in turn, could be disseminated to various regions in the brain by astrocyte-derived EVs (ADEVs). In this study we demonstrate brain region-specific up-regulation of astrocytic amyloids in morphine dependendent rhesus macaques. In addition, herein we also demonstrate increased expression of β-site cleaving enzyme (BACE1), APP, and Aβ in human primary astrocytes (HPAs) exposed to morphine. Mechanisms involved in this process included the up-regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1α), its translocation and binding to the promoter of BACE1, leading to increased BACE1 activity and, generation of Aβ 1-42. Gene silencing approaches confirmed the regulatory role of HIF-1α in BACE1 mediated amyloidosis leading to astrocyte activation and neuroinflammation. We next sought to assess whether morphine-stimulated ADEVs could carry amyloid cargoes. Results showed that morphine exposure induced the release of morphine-ADEVs, carrying amyloids. Interestingly, silencing HIF-1α in astrocytes not only reduced the numbers of ADEV released, but also the packaging of amyloid cargos in the ADEVs. These findings were further validated in brain derived EVs (BEVs) isolated from macaques, wherein it was shown that BEVs from morphine-dependent macaques, carried varieties of amyloid cargoes including the cytokine IL-1β. This is the first report implicating the role of HIF-1α-BACE1 axis in morphine-mediated induction of astrocytic amyloidosis, leading, in turn, to neuroinflammation and release of the amyloid cargoes via ADEVs. These findings set the groundwork for the future development of therapeutic strategies for targeting cognitive deficits in chronic opiate users.","2152-5250","Aging and disease","(12) 1389-1408",2021,"Susmita","Sil","S","Department of Pharmacology and Experimental Neuroscience, University of Nebraska Medical Center, Omaha, NE 68198-5880, USA."

Previous works suggest that high BACE1 activity may be present in brain, cerebrospinal fluid and serum of patients with late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) as well as mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Therefore, we evaluated whether serum BACE1 activity increases in MCI patients and is associated with the progression from MCI to dementia. BACE1 activity was measured in the serum of 259 MCI patients (162 amnestic-aMCI, 97 non-amnestic-naMCI) and 204 healthy Controls. After a median follow-up of 32 months (range: 10-153), 116 MCI progressed to dementia (87 aMCI and 29 naMCI). Serum BACE1 activity was higher in MCI compared with Controls (p < 0.001), and in aMCI with brain atrophy compared with naMCI without brain atrophy (p = 0.04). No difference in BACE1 activity emerged between converter and non-converter MCI, and this was true for both aMCI and naMCI. However, among aMCI with better cognitive performance (n. 163, MMSE score ≥24/30) those converting to dementia had higher BACE1 activity compared to stable ones (p = 0.05). This was not associated with an increased risk to develop dementia (hazard ratio: 1.65; 95% confidence interval: 0.67-4.01). In conclusion, serum BACE1 activity significantly increased in MCI patients (both amnestic and non-amnestic) compared with Controls. Moreover, higher serum BACE1 activity was observed only among aMCI with a better cognitive performance who progressed to dementia, suggesting that a dysregulation of this enzyme might be an early event primarily associated with neurodegeneration.","1471-4159","Journal of neurochemistry","(159) 629-637",2021,"Giovanni","Zuliani","G","Department of Translational Medicine and for Romagna, University of Ferrara, Ferrara, Italy."

Preventive therapies for AD are not yet available, and potential disease-modifying therapies targeting amyloid-β plaques in symptomatic stages of AD have only just been approved in the United States. Small-molecule inhibitors of β-site amyloid precursor protein (APP)-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1; also known as β-secretase 1) reduce the production of amyloid-β peptide and are among the most advanced drug candidates for AD. However, to date all phase II and phase III clinical trials of BACE inhibitors were either concluded without benefit or discontinued owing to futility or the occurrence of adverse effects. Adverse effects included early, mild cognitive impairment that was associated with all but one inhibitor; preliminary results suggest that the cognitive effects are non-progressive and reversible. These discontinuations have raised questions regarding the suitability of BACE1 as a drug target for AD. In this Perspective, we discuss the status of BACE inhibitors and suggest ways in which the results of the discontinued trials can inform the development of future clinical trials of BACE inhibitors and related secretase modulators as preventative therapies. We also propose a series of experiments that should be performed to inform 'go-no-go' decisions in future trials with BACE inhibitors and consider the possibility that low levels of BACE1 inhibition could avoid adverse effects while achieving efficacy for AD prevention.","1759-4766","Nature reviews.

In addition, overexpression of BACE1 promoted HCC cell proliferation, cell cycle progression, migration, and invasion, but inhibited cell apoptosis, while knockdown of BACE1 exerted the opposite role. Furthermore, BACE1-AS sponged miR-214-3p and inhibited its expression, thus promoting Apelin (APLN) expression.

Present study aims to understand the dual binding mechanism of silibinin in the active site of AChE and BACE1 from the intermolecular interactions, conformational flexibility, charge density distribution, binding energy and the stability of molecule. To obtain the above information, the molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) and QTAIM (quantum theory of atoms in molecules) calculations have been performed. The molecular docking reveals that silibinin molecule is forming strong and weak intermolecular interactions with the catalytic site of both enzymes.

Although there exist numerous genetic association studies pertinent to AD in different ethnicities, critical genetic factors and signaling pathways underlying its pathogenesis remain ambiguous. This study was aimed to analyze the genetic data retrieved from 32 Gene Expression Omnibus datasets belonging to diverse ethnic cohorts in order to identify overlapping differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Stringent selection criteria were framed to shortlist appropriate datasets based on false discovery rate (FDR) p-value and log FC, and relevant details of upregulated and downregulated DEGs were retrieved. Among the 32 datasets, only six satisfied the selection criteria. The GEO2R tool was employed to retrieve significant DEGs. Nine common DEGs, i.e., SLC5A3, BDNF, SST, SERPINA3, RTN3, RGS4, NPTX, ENC1 and CRYM were found in more than 60% of the selected datasets. These DEGs were later subjected to protein-protein interaction analysis with 18 AD-specific literature-derived genes. Among the nine common DEGs, BDNF, SST, SERPINA3, RTN3 and RGS4 exhibited significant interactions with crucial proteins including BACE1, GRIN2B, APP, APOE, COMT, PSEN1, INS, NEP and MAPT.

We found that PB significantly down-regulated β-amyloid (Aβ) secretion in N2a/APPsw cells. However, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. In the current study, we investigated the changes in key enzymes involved in β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism and other APP metabolites by treating N2a/APPsw cells with PB at different concentrations. The results indicated that PB reduced Aβ secretion, which was caused by down-regulation of β-secretase (BACE1) expression, as indicated at both the protein and mRNA levels. Further research revealed that PB regulated BACE1 expression by inducing the activation of forkhead box O1 (FoxO1) and inhibiting the phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). In addition, the effect of PB on BACE1 expression and Aβ secretion was reversed by treatment with FoxO1 siRNA and STAT3 antagonist S3I-201.

34699873,"The Swedish dilemma - the almost exclusive use of APPswe-based mouse models impedes adequate evaluation of alternative β-secretases.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia, however incurable so far. It is widely accepted that aggregated amyloid β (Aβ) peptides play a crucial role for the pathogenesis of AD, as they cause neurotoxicity and deposit as so-called Aβ plaques in AD patient brains. Aβ peptides derive from the amyloid precursor protein (APP) upon consecutive cleavage at the β- and γ-secretase site. Hence, mutations in the APP gene are often associated with autosomal dominant inherited AD. Almost thirty years ago, two mutations at the β-secretase site were observed in two Swedish families (termed Swedish APP (APPswe) mutations), which led to early-onset AD. Consequently, APPswe was established in almost every common AD mouse model, as it contributes to early Aβ plaque formation and cognitive impairments. Analyzing these APPswe-based mouse models, the aspartyl protease BACE1 has been evolving as the prominent β-secretase responsible for Aβ release in AD and as the most important therapeutic target for AD treatment. However, with respect to β-secretase processing, the very rare occurring APPswe variant substantially differs from wild-type APP. BACE1 dominates APPswe processing resulting in the release of Aβ1-x, whereas N-terminally truncated Aβ forms are scarcely generated. However, these N-terminally truncated Aβ species such as Aβ2-x, Aβ3-x and Aβ4-x are elevated in AD patient brains and exhibit an increased potential to aggregate compared to Aβ1-x peptides. Proteases such as meprin β, cathepsin B and ADAMTS4 were identified as alternative β-secretases being capable of generating these N-terminally truncated Aβ species from wild-type APP. However, neither meprin β nor cathepsin B are capable of generating N-terminally truncated Aβ peptides from APPswe. Hence, the role of BACE1 for the Aβ formation during AD might be overrepresented through the excessive use of APPswe mouse models. In this review we critically discuss the consideration of BACE1 as the most promising therapeutic target. Shifting the focus of AD research towards alternative β secretases might unveil promising alternatives to BACE1 inhibitors constantly failing in clinical trials due to ineffectiveness and harmful side effects.","1879-2596","Biochimica et biophysica acta.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the major progressive and currently incurable neurodegenerative disorders of the CNS, which accounts for 60-80% of cases of dementia. The pathophysiology of AD involves the accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the brain. Additionally, synaptic loss and imbalance of neuronal signaling molecules are characterized as important markers of AD. Existing treatments of AD help in the management of its symptoms and aim toward the maintenance of cognitive functions, behavior, and attenuation of gradual memory loss. Over the past decade, nonviral gene therapy has attracted increasing interest due to its various advantages over its viral counterparts. Moreover, advancements in nonviral gene technology have led to their increasing contributions in clinical trials. However, brain-targeted nonviral gene delivery vectors come across various extracellular and intracellular barriers, limiting their ability to transfer the therapeutic gene into the target cells. Chief barriers to nonviral gene therapy have been discussed briefly in this review. We have also highlighted the rapid advancement of several nonviral gene therapies for AD, which are broadly categorized into physical and chemical methods. These methods aim to modulate Aβ, beta-site amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), apolipoprotein E, or neurotrophic factors' expression in the CNS.

Many evidences suggest the involvement of neuroinflammation in the pathology of AD. Cytokines including TNF-α and IL-6 are also found increasing the BACE1 activity and expression of NFκB resulting in generation of Aβ in AD brain. Following the interaction of Aβ with microglia and astrocytes, other inflammatory molecules also get translocated to the site of inflammation by chemotaxis and exaggerate neuroinflammation. Various pathways like NFκB, p38 MAPK, Akt/mTOR, caspase, nitric oxide and COX trigger microglia to release inflammatory cytokines. PPARγ agonists like pioglitazone increases the phagocytosis of Aβ and reduces inflammatory cytokine IL-1β. Celecoxib and roficoxib like selective COX-2 inhibitors also ameliorate neuroinflammation. Non-selective COX inhibitor indomethacin is also potent inhibitor of inflammatory mediators released from microglia. Mitophagy process is considered quite helpful in reducing inflammation due to microglia as it promotes the phagocytosis of over activated microglial cells and other inflammatory cells. Mitophagy induction is also beneficial in the removal of damaged mitochondria and reduction of infiltration of inflammatory molecules at the site of accumulation of the damaged mitochondria. Targeting these pathways and eventually ameliorating the activation of microglia can mitigate neuroinflammation and come out as a better therapeutic option for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.","1568-5608","Inflammopharmacology","(29) 1669-1681",2021,"Rishika","Dhapola","R","Department of Pharmacology, Central University of Punjab, Bathinda, 151 401, India."

The latter is linked to downregulation of the small GTPase Rab35, which mediates Tau degradation via the endolysosomal pathway. Whether Rab35 is also involved in Aβ overproduction remains an open question. Here, we find that hippocampal Rab35 levels are decreased not only by stress/GC but also by aging, another AD risk factor. Moreover, we show that Rab35 negatively regulates Aβ production by sorting amyloid precursor protein (APP) and β-secretase (BACE1) out of the endosomal network, where they interact to produce Aβ. Interestingly, Rab35 coordinates distinct intracellular trafficking steps for BACE1 and APP, mediated by its effectors OCRL and ACAP2, respectively. Finally, we demonstrate that Rab35 overexpression prevents the amyloidogenic trafficking of APP and BACE1 induced by high GC levels. These studies identify Rab35 as a key regulator of APP processing and suggest that its downregulation may contribute to stress-related and AD-related amyloidogenesis.","2041-4889","Cell death & disease","(12) 1137",2021,"Viktoriya","Zhuravleva","V","Neurobiology and Behavior Graduate Program, Columbia University, New York, NY, 10032, USA."

34915100,"A short peptide from sAPPα binding to BACE1-APP action site rescues Alzheimer-like pathology.","Amyloid β-peptide (Aβ) is the driven force of Alzheimer's disease (AD), and reducing Aβ production could be a potential therapeutic strategy for AD. sAPPα appears to have the ability to specifically inhibit β-cleavage of APP without inhibiting BACE1 completely, direct administration of sAPPα may not be clinically applicable due to the low permeability of blood-brain barrier (BBB). In this study, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of a short peptide generated from sAPPα, which could specifically bind to BACE1 at the BACE1-APP action site. We found that this peptide significantly reduced Aβ production both in vivo and in vitro, thus further attenuated Aβ deposition, Tau hyperphosphorylation, neuroinflammation et al. and rescued behavioral deficits. Therefore, this short peptide may hold promise for the treatment of AD due to its neuroprotective effects, low molecular weight to cross BBB, and less safety concerns. The anti-neurodegenerative capacity of sAPPα may not result solely from direct inhibition of BACE1.","1872-7972","Neuroscience letters","(770) 136397",2022,"Xia","Lai","X","Department of General Medicine and Center of Health Management Daping Hospital Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400042, China."

We already reported that O-GlcNAcylation of amyloid precursor protein (APP) in response to insulin signaling reduces neurotoxic amyloid-β (Aβ) production via inhibition of APP endocytosis. Internalized APP is delivered to endosomes and lysosomes where Aβ is produced. However, the molecular mechanism involved in the effect of APP O-GlcNAcylation on APP trafficking remains unknown. To investigate the relationship between APP O-GlcNAcylation and APP endocytosis, we tested the effects of insulin on neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells overexpressing APP and BACE1, and cultured rat hippocampal neurons. The present study showed that APP O-GlcNAcylation translocated APP from lipid raft to non-raft microdomains in the plasma membrane by using immunocytochemistry and discontinuous sucrose gradients method. By using the biotinylation method, we also found that APP preferentially underwent endocytosis from lipid rafts and that the amount of internalized APP from lipid rafts was specifically reduced by O-GlcNAcylation. These results indicate that O-GlcNAcylation can regulate lipid raft-dependent APP endocytosis via translocation of APP into non-raft microdomains. Our findings showed a new functional role of O-GlcNAcylation for the regulation of APP trafficking, offering new mechanistic insight for Aβ production.","2077-0375","Membranes","909",2021,"Oh-Hoon","Kwon","OH","Department of Physiology, Sungkyunkwan University School of Medicine, Suwon 16419, Korea."

Our previous studies revealed that vitamin D deficiency promotes β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition in the APP/PS1 mouse brains, while supplemented with a specific agonist of vitamin D receptor (VDR), paricalcitol (PAL), significantly reduced Aβ production via promoting the lysosomal degradation of β-site APP cleavage enzyme 1 (BACE1). In this study, our data suggested that activation of VDR by PAL significantly reduced the iron accumulation in the cortex and hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice through downregulation of Transferrin receptor (TFR) by reducing iron-regulatory protein 2 (IRP2) expression. Furthermore, activation of VDR effectively reduced the phosphorylations of Tau at Ser396 and Thr181 sites via inhibiting the GSK3β phosphorylation (Tyr216). Taken together, our data suggest that activation of VDR could inhibit the phosphorylations of Tau possibly by repressing the iron accumulation-induced upregulation of GSK3β activity in the brains of APP/PS1 mice. Thus, activation of VDR may be an effective strategy for treating AD.","1872-9754","Neurochemistry international","(153) 105260",2022,"Ting-Yao","Wu","TY","First Affiliated Hospital of Jinzhou Medical University, Jinzhou, 121000, China.

C/EBPβ, a proinflammatory cytokine-activated transcription factor, is upregulated in AD patients and increases cytokines and δ-secretase expression. Under physiological conditions, ApoE is mainly expressed in glial cells, but its neuronal expression is highly elevated under pathological stresses. However, how neuronal ApoE4 mediates AD pathologies remains incompletely understood. Here we show that ApoE4 activates C/EBPβ that subsequently regulates APP, Tau and BACE1 mRNA expression in mouse neurons, driving AD-like pathogenesis. To interrogate the pathological roles of both human ApoE4 and C/EBPβ elevation in neurons in the aged brain, we develop neuronal specific Thy1-ApoE4/C/EBPβ double transgenic mice. Neuronal ApoE4 strongly activates C/EBPβ and augmented δ-secretase subsequently cleaves increased mouse APP and Tau, promoting AD-like pathologies. Notably, Thy1-ApoE4/C/EBPβ mice develop amyloid deposits, Tau aggregates and neurodegeneration in an age-dependent manner, leading to synaptic dysfunction and cognitive disorders. Thus, our findings demonstrate that neuronal ApoE4 triggers AD pathogenesis via activating the crucial regulator C/EBPβ.","1873-5118","Progress in neurobiology","(209) 102212",2022,"Zhi-Hao","Wang","ZH","Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Emory University School of Medicine, Laney Graduate School, Emory University, Atlanta, GA, 30322, USA; Department of Neurology, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, 430060, China."

However, the pathophysiological mechanisms of Aβ accumulation remain elusive. Here, we report that rats fed high-phytate diets showed Aβ accumulation and increased apoptotic neuronal cell death in the hippocampus through the activation of the amyloidogenic pathway in the hippocampus. Immunoblotting and immunohistochemical analyses confirmed that the overexpression of BACE1 β-secretase, a critical enzyme for Aβ generation, exacerbated the hippocampal Aβ accumulation in rats fed high-phytate diets. Moreover, we identified that parathyroid hormone, a physiological hormone responding to the phytate-mediated dysregulation of calcium and phosphate homeostasis, plays an essential role in the transcriptional activation of the Aβ precursor protein and BACE1 through the vitamin D receptor and retinoid X receptor axis. Thus, our findings suggest that phytate-mediated dysregulation of calcium and phosphate is a substantial risk factor for elevated Aβ accumulation and apoptotic neuronal cell death in rats.","2072-6643","Nutrients","4370",2021,"Hyo-Jung","Kim","HJ","Department of Physiology, Lee Gil Ya Cancer and Diabetes Institute, Gachon University College of Medicine, Incheon 406-840, Korea."

In a previous study, we found that the scaffold protein, disrupted in Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) is down-regulated in the AD brains, and ectopic expression of DISC1 can delay the progression of AD by protecting synaptic plasticity and down-regulating BACE1. However, the underlying mechanisms remain not to be elucidated. In the present study, we compared the proteomes of normal and DISC1high AD cells expressing the amyloid precursor protein (APP) using isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) and mass spectrometry (MS). The differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified, and the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed to identify the interacting partners of DISC1. Based on the interaction scores, NDE1, GRM3, PTGER3 and KATNA1 were identified as functionally or physically related to DISC1, and may therefore regulate AD development. The DEPs were functionally annotated by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) databases with the DAVID software, and the Non-supervised Orthologous Groups (eggNOG) database was used to determine their evolutionary relationships. The DEPs were significantly enriched in microtubules and mitochondria-related pathways.

However, it is not known whether BACE1 and APP are transported through the Golgi stacks together and sorted at the TGN or segregated prior to arrival at the TGN. To address this question, we have used high-resolution Airyscan technology followed by Huygens deconvolution to quantify the overlap of BACE1 and APP in Golgi subcompartments in HeLa cells and primary neurons. Here, we show that APP and BACE1 are segregated, on exit from the endoplasmic reticulum and in the cis-Golgi and throughout the Golgi stack. In contrast, the transferrin receptor, which exits the TGN in AP-1 mediated transport carriers as for BACE1, colocalizes with BACE1, but not APP, throughout the Golgi stack. The segregation of APP and BACE1 is independent of the Golgi ribbon structure and the cytoplasmic domain of the cargo.

35089425,"Revisiting APP secretases: an overview on the holistic effects of retinoic acid receptor stimulation in APP processing.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the leading cause of dementia worldwide and is characterized by the accumulation of the β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) in the brain, along with profound alterations in phosphorylation-related events and regulatory pathways. The production of the neurotoxic Aβ peptide via amyloid precursor protein (APP) proteolysis is a crucial step in AD development. APP is highly expressed in the brain and is complexly metabolized by a series of sequential secretases, commonly denoted the α-, β-, and γ-cleavages. The toxicity of resulting fragments is a direct consequence of the first cleaving event. β-secretase (BACE1) induces amyloidogenic cleavages, while α-secretases (ADAM10 and ADAM17) result in less pathological peptides. Hence this first cleavage event is a prime therapeutic target for preventing or reverting initial biochemical events involved in AD. The subsequent cleavage by γ-secretase has a reduced impact on Aβ formation but affects the peptides' aggregating capacity. An array of therapeutic strategies are being explored, among them targeting Retinoic Acid (RA) signalling, which has long been associated with neuronal health. Additionally, several studies have described altered RA levels in AD patients, reinforcing RA Receptor (RAR) signalling as a promising therapeutic strategy. In this review we provide a holistic approach focussing on the effects of isoform-specific RAR modulation with respect to APP secretases and discuss its advantages and drawbacks in subcellular AD related events.","1420-9071","Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS","(79) 101",2022,"José J M","Vitória","JJM","Department of Medical Sciences, Neurosciences and Signalling Group, Institute of Biomedicine, University of Aveiro, 3810-193, Aveiro, Portugal."

Consequently, we assessed the inhibitory activities of some endophytes-derived compounds against selected targets towards discovery of novel neurotherapeutics. Standard inhibitors and 83 endophytes-derived compounds were docked against acetylcholinesterase (AChE), butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), BACE 1 and MAO using AutodockVina while the molecular interactions between the selected targets and the compounds with notable binding affinity were viewed through Discovery Studio Visualizer.

From the 83 compounds, asperflavin, ascomfurans C, camptothecine and corynesidone A exhibited remarkable inhibitory activity against all the four target enzymes compared to the respective standard inhibitors. However, only corynesidone A could transverse the BBB and predicted to be safe. MD simulation of the unbound and complexed enzymes with corynesidone A showed that the complexes were stable throughout the simulation time. Given the exceptional inhibitory activity of endophytes-derived corynesidone A against the four selected targets, its ability to permeate the BBB, excellent drugability properties as well as its stability when complexed with the enzymes, it is a good candidate for further studies towards development of new neurotherapeutics.Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

Although the greatest expression of BACE1 is found in the brain, BACE1 mRNA and protein is also found in many cell types including pancreatic β-cells, adipocytes, hepatocytes, and vascular cells. Pathologically elevated BACE1 expression in these cells has been implicated in the development of metabolic diseases, including type 2 diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease. In this review, we examine key questions surrounding the BACE1 literature, including how is BACE1 regulated and how dysregulation may occur in disease, and understand how BACE1 regulates metabolism via cleavage of a myriad of substrates. The phenotype of the BACE1 knockout mice models, including reduced weight gain, increased energy expenditure, and enhanced leptin signaling, proposes a physiological role of BACE1 in regulating energy metabolism and homeostasis. Taken together with the weight loss observed with BACE1 inhibitors in clinical trials, these data highlight a novel role for BACE1 in regulation of metabolic physiology. Finally, this review aims to examine the possibility that BACE1 inhibitors could provide a innovative treatment for obesity and its comorbidities.","1467-789X","Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity","(23) e13430",2022,"Hannah A","Taylor","HA","Discovery & Translational Science Department, Leeds Institute of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Medicine, University of Leeds, Leeds, UK."

35122055,"Pharmacological inhibition of BACE1 suppresses glioblastoma growth by stimulating macrophage phagocytosis of tumor cells.","Glioblastoma (GBM) contains abundant tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). The majority of TAMs are tumor-promoting macrophages (pTAMs), while tumor-suppressive macrophages (sTAMs) are the minority. Thus, reprogramming pTAMs into sTAMs represents an attractive therapeutic strategy. By screening a collection of small-molecule compounds, we find that inhibiting β-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) with MK-8931 potently reprograms pTAMs into sTAMs and promotes macrophage phagocytosis of glioma cells; moreover, low-dose radiation markedly enhances TAM infiltration and synergizes with MK-8931 treatment to suppress malignant growth. BACE1 is preferentially expressed by pTAMs in human GBMs and is required to maintain pTAM polarization through trans-interleukin 6 (IL-6)-soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R)-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling. Because MK-8931 and other BACE1 inhibitors have been developed for Alzheimer's disease and have been shown to be safe for humans in clinical trials, these inhibitors could potentially be streamlined for cancer therapy. Collectively, this study offers a promising therapeutic approach to enhance macrophage-based therapy for malignant tumors.","2662-1347","Nature cancer","(2) 1136-1151",2021,"Kui","Zhai","K","Department of Cancer Biology, Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH, USA."

MicroRNA (miR)-212-3p has been identified to exert neuroprotective effects on brain disorders. The current study analyzed the protective role of miR-212-3p in AD rats via regulating the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptor family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3)/Caspase-1 signaling pathway. The AD rat model was established via injection of amyloid-β 1-42 (Aβ1-42), followed by the Morris water maze test. The morphology and functions of neurons were observed. Furthermore, miR-212-3p, NLRP3, cleaved Caspase-1, gasdermin D N-terminus, interleukin (IL)-1β and IL-18 expressions were measured. H19-7 cells were treated with Aβ1-42 to establish the AD cell model, followed by an assessment of cell viability and pyroptosis. Downstream targets of miR-212-3p and specificity protein 1 (SP1), as well as beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) were predicted by databases and testified using dual-luciferase and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. miR-212-3p was weakly expressed in AD rats. miR-212-3p overexpression was linked to improved learning and memory capacities of AD rats and reduced neuronal pyroptosis linked to neuroinflammation attenuation. In vitro, miR-212-3p improved viability and suppressed pyroptosis of neurons via inhibiting NLRP3/Caspase-1.

Despite significant advances in the understanding of AD pathobiology, no disease modifying treatment is available. MicroRNA-124 (miR-124) is the most abundant miRNA in the normal brain with great potency to ameliorate AD-like pathology, while it is deficient in AD brain. Herein, the authors develop a DNA nanoflowers (DFs)-based delivery system to realize exogenous supplementation of miR-124 for AD therapy. The DFs with well-controlled size and morphology are prepared, and a miR-124 chimera is attached via hybridization. The DFs are further modified with RVG29 peptide to simultaneously realize brain-blood barrier (BBB) penetration and neuron targeting. Meanwhile, Rutin, a small molecular ancillary drug, is co-loaded into the DFs structure via its intercalation into the double stranded DNA region. Interestingly, Rutin could synergize miR-124 to suppress the expression of both BACE1 and APP, thus achieving a robust inhibition of amyloid β generation. The nanosystem could pro-long miR-124 circulation in vivo, promote its BBB penetration and neuron targeting, resulting in a significant increase of miR-124 in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice and robust therapeutic efficacy in vivo.

However, specific contributions of different cell types to Aβ deposition remain unknown. Non-coding microRNAs (miRNA) play important roles in AD by regulating translation of major associated proteins, such as Aβ precursor protein (APP) and β-site APP-cleaving enzyme (BACE1), two key proteins associated with Aβ biogenesis. MiRNAs typically silence protein expression via binding specific sites in mRNAs' 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTR). MiRNAs regulate protein levels in a cell-type specific manner; however, mechanisms of the variation of miRNA activity remain unknown. We report that miR-298 treatment reduced native APP and BACE1 protein levels in an astrocytic but not in a neuron-like cell line. From miR-298's effects on APP-3'-UTR activity and native protein levels, we infer that differences in APP 3'-UTR length could explain differential miR-298 activity. Such varied or truncated, but natural, 3'-UTR specific to a given cell type provides an opportunity to regulate native protein levels by particular miRNA.

BACE1 was also discovered to act like an auxiliary subunit to modulate neuronal KCNQ2/3 channels independently of its proteolytic function. BACE1 is palmitoylated at its carboxyl-terminal region, which brings BACE1 to ordered, cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains (lipid rafts). However, the physiological consequences of this specific localization of BACE1 remain elusive. Using spectral Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET), BACE1 and KCNQ2/3 channels were confirmed to form a signaling complex, a phenomenon that was relatively independent of the palmitoylation of BACE1. Nevertheless, palmitoylation of BACE1 was required for recruitment of KCNQ2/3 channels to lipid-raft domains. Two fluorescent probes, designated L10 and S15, were used to label lipid-raft and non-raft domains of the plasma membrane, respectively. Coexpressing BACE1 substantially elevated FRET between L10 and KCNQ2/3, whereas the BACE1-4C/A quadruple mutation failed to produce this effect. In contrast, BACE1 had no significant effect on FRET between S15 probes and KCNQ2/3 channels. A reduction of BACE1-dependent FRET between raft-targeting L10 probes and KCNQ2/3 channels by applying the cholesterol-extracting reagent methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD), raft-disrupting general anesthetics, or pharmacological inhibitors of palmitoylation, all supported the hypothesis of the palmitoylation-dependent and raft-specific localization of KCNQ2/3 channels. Furthermore, mutating the four carboxyl-terminal cysteines (4C/A) of BACE1 abolished the BACE1-dependent increase of FRET between KCNQ2/3 and the lipid raft-specific protein caveolin 1. Taking these data collectively, we propose that the AD-related protein BACE1 underlies the localization of a neuronal potassium channel.","1540-7748","The Journal of general physiology","e202112888",2022,"Gucan","Dai","G","Department of Physiology and Biophysics, University of Washington, Seattle, WA."

We previously identified a role for the deubiquitinase USP25, encoded on chromosome 21, in regulating microglial homeostasis in the AD brain; however, whether USP25 affects amyloid pathology remains unknown. Here, by crossing 5×FAD AD and Dp16 DS mice, we observed that trisomy 21 exacerbated amyloid pathology in the 5×FAD brain. Moreover, bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgene-mediated USP25 overexpression increased amyloid deposition in the 5×FAD mouse brain, whereas genetic deletion of Usp25 reduced amyloid deposition. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that USP25 promoted β cleavage of APP and Aβ generation by reducing the ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation of both APP and BACE1. Importantly, pharmacological inhibition of USP25 ameliorated amyloid pathology in the 5×FAD mouse brain. In summary, we identified the DS-related gene USP25 as a critical regulator of AD pathology, and our data suggest that USP25 serves as a potential pharmacological target for AD drug development.","1558-8238","The Journal of clinical investigation","10.1172/JCI152170",2022,"Qiuyang","Zheng","Q","State Key Laboratory of Cellular Stress Biology, Fujian Provincial Key Laboratory of Neurodegenerative Disease and Aging Research, Institute of Neuroscience, Department of Neuroscience, Center for Brain Sciences, First Affiliated Hospital of Xiamen University, School of Medicine, Xiamen University, Xiamen, China."

The neuronal isoform of BIN1 (BIN1V1), but not the non-neuronal isoform (BIN1V9), has been shown to regulate tau-pathology and Aβ generation via RAB5-mediated endocytosis in neurons. BIN1 directly interacts with RIN3 to initiate RAB5-mediated endocytosis, which is essential for β-secretase (BACE1)-mediated β-secretase cleavage of β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) to generate Amyloid-β (Aβ), the key component of senile plaques in AD. Understanding the regulatory roles of BIN1 (neuronal BIN1V1) and RIN3 in β-secretase mediated cleavage of APP and Aβ generation is key to developing novel therapeutics to delay or prevent AD progression. Neuronal and non-neuronal isoforms of BIN1 (BIN1V1 and BIN1V9, respectively) were introduced with RIN3 into an in vitro cell-based system to test RIN3-dependent effects of neuronal BIN1V1 and non-neuronal BIN1V9 on β-secretase-mediated cleavage of APP and Aβ generation. Confocal microscopy was performed to examine RIN3-dependent subcellular localization of BIN1V1 and BIN1V9. Western blot analysis was performed to assess the effects of RIN3 and BIN1V1/BIN1V9 on β-secretase mediated processing of APP. We enriched cells expressing BIN1V1 without or with RIN3 via FACS to measure Aβ generation using Aβ ELISA assay, and to evaluate APP internalization by chasing biotinylated or antibody-labeled cell surface APP. Neuronal BIN1V1 containing the CLAP domain and non-neuronal BIN1V9 lacking the CLAP domain are the major isoforms present in the brain. Employing confocal microscopy, we showed that RIN3 differentially regulates the recruitment of both BIN1V1 and BIN1V9 into RAB5-endosomes. We further showed that BIN1V1, but not BIN1V9, downregulates β-secretase (BACE1)-mediated processing of APP in a RIN3-dependent manner. Overexpression of BIN1V1 also attenuated Aβ generation in a RIN3-dependent manner. Using cell-based internalization assays, we show BIN1V1, but not BIN1V9, delays the endocytosis of APP, but not of BACE1, into early endosomes, thereby spatially and temporally separating these two proteins into different cellular compartments, resulting in reduced cleavage of APP by BACE1 and reduced Aβ generation-all in a RIN3-dependent manner. Finally, we show that RIN3 sequesters BIN1V1 in RAB5-positive early endosomes, likely via the CLAP-domain, resulting in attenuated β-secretase processing of APP and Aβ generation by delaying endocytosis of APP. Our findings provide new mechanistic data on how two AD-associated molecules, RIN3 and BIN1 (neuronal BIN1V1), interact to govern Aβ production, implicating these two proteins as potential therapeutic targets for the prevention and treatment of AD.","2045-2322","Scientific reports","(12) 3486",2022,"Raja","Bhattacharyya","R","Genetics and Aging Research Unit, MassGeneral Institute for Neurodegenerative Disease, Henry and Allison McCance Center for Brain Health, Department of Neurology, Massachusetts General Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA. bhattacharyya.raja@mgh.harvard.edu."

Initial and continued research has shown that many calmodulin binding proteins mediate multiple events during the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease, thus establishing the ""Calmodulin Hypothesis"". To gain insight into the general applicability of this hypothesis, the involvement of calmodulin in neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, frontotemporal dementia, and other dementias was explored. After a literature search for calmodulin binding, 11 different neuroinflammatory proteins (TREM2, CD33, PILRA, CR1, MS4A, CLU, ABCA7, EPHA1, ABCA1, CH3L1/YKL-40 and NLRP3) were scanned for calmodulin binding domains using the Calmodulin Target Database. This analysis revealed the presence of at least one binding domain within which visual scanning demonstrated the presence of valid binding motifs. Coupled with previous research that identified 13 other neuroinflammation linked proteins (BACE1, BIN1, CaMKII, PP2B, PMCA, NOS, NMDAR, AchR, Ado A2AR, Aβ, APOE, SNCA, TMEM175), this work shows that at least 24 critical proteins involved in neuroinflammation are putative or proven calmodulin binding proteins. Many of these proteins are linked to multiple neurodegenerative diseases indicating that calmodulin binding proteins lie at the heart of neuroinflammatory events associated with multiple neurodegenerative diseases. Since many calmodulin-based pharmaceuticals have been successfully used to treat Huntington's and other neurodegenerative diseases, these findings argue for their immediate therapeutic implementation.","1471-2202","BMC neuroscience","(23) 10",2022,"Danton H","O'Day","DH","Cell and Systems Biology, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, M5S 3G5, Canada."

Recently, emerging evidence from preclinical studies suggested the potential in developing therapeutics of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by targeting bromodomain containing protein 4 (BRD4), an epigenetic regulatory protein. However, further characterization of AD-related pathological events is urgently required. Here, we investigated the effects of pharmacological degradation or inhibition of BRD4 on AD cell models. Interestingly, we found that both degradation and inhibition of BRD4 by ARV-825 and JQ1, respectively, robustly increased the levels of amyloid-beta (Aβ), which has been associated with the neuropathology of AD. Subsequently, we characterized the mechanisms by which downregulation of BRD4 increases Aβ levels. We found that both degradation and inhibition of BRD4 increased the levels of BACE1, the enzyme responsible for cleavage of the amyloid-beta protein precursor (APP) to generate Aβ. Consistent with Aβ increase, we also found that downregulation of BRD4 increased AD-related phosphorylated Tau (pTau) protein in our 3D-AD human neural cell culture model. Therefore, our results suggest that downregulation of BRD4 would not be a viable strategy for AD intervention.

Ginsenoside Rg1 (Rg1) has a significant neuroprotective effect on animals with memory impairment. However, the mechanism of how Rg1 mediates the Wnt signaling pathway and improves cognitive function by regulating oxidative stress, apoptosis, and neuroinflammation is still unclear. In this study, the spatial memory ability of tree shrews was tested by Morris water maze, the expression levels of amyloid protein (Aβ1-42), ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (iba-1), nitrotyrosine (NT), and 8-hydroxyguanine (8-OHG) were detected by immunohistochemistry. Subsequently, the activity of catalase (CAT) and the glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) was, respectively, measured by the ammonium molybdate method and the 5,5'-dithiobis (2-nitrobenzoic acid). Furthermore, the malondialdehyde (MDA) concentration was determined by the thiobarbituric acid test. Finally, the expression levels of Beta-secretase (BACE1), superoxide dismutase (SOD), BCL2-Associated X (Bax), B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2), caspase-anti-apoptotic factor Cleaved-caspase-3 (Caspase-3), microtubule-associated proteins 2 (MAP2), Neuronal nuclear antigen (NeuN), as well as the phosphorylation of GSK-3β and β-catenin were detected by Western blot. This study implied that Rg1 reduced the phosphorylation of Tau protein, the deposition of Aβ1-42, and the expression of BACE1. It also showed that Rg1 increased the antioxidant activity of SOD, CAT, GPx, and instead reduced the oxidation products of NT, 8-OHG, and MDA, as wells as the inflammatory factor interleukin-1 and iba-1. It further showed that Rg1 increased the ratio of Bcl-2 to Bax and expression of neuronal markers MAP2 and NeuN, but instead reduced the expression of Caspase-3, GSK-3β, and β-catenin. In conclusion, by regulating the Wnt/GSK-3β/β-catenin signaling pathway, Rg1 of moderate and high dose could alleviate oxidative stress damage, improve neuroinflammation, protect neurons, finally improve the cognitive impairment of the AD tree shrew. This study provides theoretical basis for the Rg1 clinical application in AD.","1747-0285","Chemical biology & drug design","(99) 884-896",2022,"Yi","Yang","Y","Department of Laboratory Animal Science, Kunming Medical University, Kunming, China."

35353937,"Reducing Nav1.6 expression attenuates the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease by suppressing BACE1 transcription.","Aberrant increases in neuronal network excitability may contribute to cognitive deficits in Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the mechanisms underlying hyperexcitability of neurons are not fully understood. Voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSC or Nav), which are involved in the formation of excitable cell's action potential and can directly influence the excitability of neural networks, have been implicated in AD-related abnormal neuronal hyperactivity and higher incidence of spontaneous non-convulsive seizures. Here, we have shown that the reduction of VGSC α-subunit Nav1.6 (by injecting adeno-associated virus (AAV) with short hairpin RNA (shRNA) into the hippocampus) rescues cognitive impairments and attenuates synaptic deficits in APP/PS1 transgenic mice. Concurrently, amyloid plaques in the hippocampus and levels of soluble Aβ are significantly reduced. Interfering with Nav1.6 reduces the transcription level of β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), which is Aβ-dependent. In the presence of Aβ oligomers, knockdown of Nav1.6 reduces intracellular calcium overload by suppressing reverse sodium-calcium exchange channel, consequently increasing inactive NFAT1 (the nuclear factor of activated T cells) levels and thus reducing BACE1 transcription. This mechanism leads to a reduction in the levels of Aβ in APP/PS1 transgenic mice, alleviates synaptic loss, improves learning and memory disorders in APP/PS1 mice after downregulating Nav1.6 in the hippocampus. Our study offers a new potential therapeutic strategy to counteract hippocampal hyperexcitability and subsequently rescue cognitive deficits in AD by selective blockade of Nav1.6 overexpression and/or hyperactivity.","1474-9726","Aging cell","(21) e13593",2022,"De-Juan","Yuan","DJ","Department of Physiology, College of Basic Medical Sciences, Liaoning Provincial Key Laboratory of Cerebral Diseases, National-Local Joint Engineering Research Center for Drug-Research and Development (R&D) of Neurodegenerative Diseases, Dalian Medical University, Dalian, China."

According to recent clinical data, the incidence of the disease is exponentially increasing with age. Beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme1 (BACE1) is an important molecule involved in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease due to its early role in the amyloid cascade. Cleavage of amyloid precursor protein by BACE1 is the rate-limiting step leading to the production and aggregation of amyloid-beta plaques. A number of natural products are being identified as non-competitive BACE1 inhibitors. In Ayurveda, Medhya rasayana is a group of medicinal herbs, specifically used for managing neurological disorders and is known to be effective in improving cognitivity and intellect. This study aimed to analyze the pharmacological activity of bio-active compounds in Medhya rasayana plants against BACE1, employing structure-based docking approach. 11 compounds out of 876 were identified as potential hits, based on docking scores, binding energies, and interactions with the critical residues of BACE1. Possible neurological activities of these compounds were predicted using PASS server. Out of the 11 compounds screened, two compounds, 'Convolidine' from the plant Convolvulus pleuricaulis Choisy and 'N-(4-hydroxybutyl) phthalimide' from Glycyrrhiza glabra satisfied the pharmacological parameters of Lipinski rule of filtering and ADMET prediction. The binding stability of these compounds against BACE1 was confirmed by molecular dynamic simulation and post dynamic MM/GBSA calculations.

35364737,"Dapagliflozin as an autophagic enhancer via LKB1/AMPK/SIRT1 pathway in ovariectomized/D-galactose Alzheimer's rat model.","Autophagy and mitochondrial deficits are characteristics of early phase of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors have been nominated as a promising class against AD hallmarks. However, there are no available data yet to discuss the impact of gliflozins on autophagic pathways in AD. Peripherally, dapagliflozin's (DAPA) effect is mostly owed to autophagic signals. Thus, the goal of this study is to screen the power of DAPA centrally on LKB1/AMPK/SIRT1/mTOR signaling in the ovariectomized/D-galactose (OVX/D-Gal) rat model. Animals were arbitrarily distributed between 5 groups; the first group undergone sham operation, while remaining groups undergone OVX followed by D-Gal (150 mg/kg/day; i.p.) for 70 days. After 6 weeks, the third, fourth, and fifth groups received DAPA (1 mg/kg/day; p.o.); concomitantly with the AMPK inhibitor dorsomorphin (DORSO, 25 µg/rat, i.v.) in the fourth group and the SIRT1 inhibitor EX-527 (10 µg/rat, i.v.) in the fifth group. DAPA mitigated cognitive deficits of OVX/D-Gal rats, as mirrored in neurobehavioral task with hippocampal histopathological examination and immunohistochemical aggregates of p-Tau. The neuroprotective effect of DAPA was manifested by elevation of energy sensors; AMP/ATP ratio and LKB1/AMPK protein expressions along with autophagic markers; SIRT1, Beclin1, and LC3B expressions. Downstream the latter, DAPA boosted mTOR and mitochondrial function; TFAM, in contrary lessened BACE1. Herein, DORSO or EX-527 co-administration prohibited DAPA's actions where DORSO elucidated DAPA's direct effect on LKB1 while EX-527 mirrored its indirect effect on SIRT1. Therefore, DAPA implied its anti-AD effect, at least in part, via boosting hippocampal LKB1/AMPK/SIRT1/mTOR signaling in OVX/D-Gal rat model.","1568-5608","Inflammopharmacology","(30) 2505-2520",2022,"Weam W","Ibrahim","WW","Department of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo University, Kasr El-Aini St., Cairo, 11562, Egypt."
35378374,"Ketamine promotes the amyloidogenic pathway by regulating endosomal pH.","Ketamine is an anesthetic and addictive drug that can cause cognitive dysfunction and neuroinflammation. Studies have shown that carboxy-terminal fragment derived from β-secretase (CTF-β) and amyloid beta (Aβ), the amyloidogenic products of amyloid precursor protein (APP), can also induce neuroinflammation and impair cognitive function. However, it remains unclear whether ketamine regulates the amyloidogenic pathway. In the endosome, APP is cleaved by beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), whose activity is influenced by pH. Endosomal acidification is mainly regulated by sodium hydrogen exchanger 6 (NHE6), which leaks protons out of endosomes, and vacuolar proton translocating ATPases (V-ATPase), which pump protons into endosomes. Therefore, we hypothesized that ketamine lowers the endosomal pH by reducing the endosomal NHE6 protein level, and this hyperacidification promotes the amyloidogenic pathway. We set up C57BL/6 J mouse models using 10, 20, 40, 80, and 100 mg/kg ketamine administration and SH-SY5Y cell models using 1, 10, 100, and 1000 μM ketamine administration to investigate its effects on the amyloidogenic pathway at different doses. Western blotting results showed that 100 mg/kg ketamine treatment in vivo and 1000 μM ketamine treatment in vitro increased endosomal BACE1 and CTF-β protein levels and reduced endosomal NHE6 and APP protein levels. The endosomal accumulation of BACE1 caused by ketamine administration was also observed using confocal imaging. Moreover, flow cytometry indicated that ketamine treatment lowered the endosomal pH value of SH-SY5Y cells. Later, cells were pretreated with monensin to restore the endosomal pH. Monensin did not affect amyloidogenic-related proteins or NHE6 directly; therefore, ketamine-promoted endosomal amyloidogenic processing and BACE1 accumulation were depleted by restoring endosomal acidity through monensin pretreatment. Finally, knockdown of NHE6 promoted the amyloidogenic pathway similarly and prevented further enhancement by ketamine. These results indicated that the effects of ketamine on the amyloidogenic pathway were dependent on the reduction of NHE6 and endosomal pH.","1879-3185","Toxicology","(471) 153163",2022,"Weishu","Ren","W","School of Forensic Medicine, China Medical University, Shenyang, China."

Abnormally elevated levels of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) resulting in decreased levels of ACh are common in AD patients; thus, AChE inhibitors (AChEIs) are widely used for the treatment of AD. In our previous work, we acquired DNA aptamers Ob1, Ob2, and Ob3 against human brain AChE from systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX). In this study, we investigated the effect of these aptamers on learning and memory abilities, as well as the underlying mechanism in a 5×FAD transgenic AD mouse model. Here, we showed that only aptamer Ob2 exhibits a good inhibitory effect on both mouse and human AChE activity. In addition, chronic treatment with aptamer Ob2 significantly improved cognitive ability of 5×FAD mice in the Morris water maze. Moreover, the mechanism of aptamer Ob2 in 5×FAD mice may be associated with its inhibition of AChE activity, alleviation of the levels of Aβ by lowering the expression of β-secretase (BACE1), and activation of astrocytes in the brains of 5×FAD mice.

Recently, we have identified methyl CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) as a potential binding partner of the intracellular L1 domain. By ELISA we show here that L1's intracellular domain binds directly to MeCP2 via the sequence motif KDET. Proximity ligation assay with cultured cerebellar and cortical neurons suggests a close association between L1 and MeCP2 in nuclei of neurons. Immunoprecipitation using MeCP2 antibodies and nuclear mouse brain extracts indicates that MeCP2 interacts with an L1 fragment of ~55 kDa (L1-55). Proximity ligation assay indicates that metalloproteases, β-site of amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme (BACE1) and ɣ-secretase, are involved in the generation of L1-55. Reduction in MeCP2 expression by siRNA decreases L1-dependent neurite outgrowth from cultured cortical neurons as well as the migration of L1-expressing HEK293 cells. Moreover, L1 siRNA, MeCP2 siRNA, or a cell-penetrating KDET-containing L1 peptide leads to reduced levels of myocyte enhancer factor 2C (Mef2c) mRNA and protein in cortical neurons, suggesting that the MeCP2/L1 interaction regulates Mef2c expression.

Several studies have suggested that hyperammonemia may also be linked to the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, the direct evidence for a role of ammonia in the pathophysiology of AD remains to be discovered. Herein, we report that hyperammonemia increases the amount of mature amyloid precursor protein (mAPP) in astrocytes, the largest and most prevalent type of glial cells in the central nervous system that are capable of metabolizing glutamate and ammonia, and promotes amyloid beta (Aβ) production. We demonstrate the accumulation of mAPP in astrocytes was primarily due to enhanced endocytosis of mAPP from the plasma membrane. A large proportion of internalized mAPP was targeted not to the lysosome, but to the endoplasmic reticulum, where processing enzymes β-secretase BACE1 (beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1) and γ-secretase presenilin-1 are expressed, and mAPP is cleaved to produce Aβ. Finally, we show the ammonia-induced production of Aβ in astrocytic endoplasmic reticulum was specific to Aβ42, a principal component of senile plaques in AD patients.

Intriguingly, cellular aging is reversible just by SIRT3 overexpression, which raises many questions about the role of SIRT3 in the molecular anti-aging mechanisms. Therefore, functions of SIRT3 were analyzed through the interaction network of 407 substrates collected by data mining. Results of the pathway enrichment and gene function prediction confirmed functions in the primary metabolism and mitochondrial ATP production. However, it also suggested involvement in thermogenesis, brain-related neurodegenerative diseases Alzheimer's (AD), Parkinson's, Huntington's disease (HD), and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. The protein node prioritization analysis identified subunits of the complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) as the nodes with the main regulatory effect within the entire interaction network. Additional high-ranked nodes were succinate dehydrogenase subunit B (SDHB), complex II, and ATP5F1, complex V of MRC. The analysis supports existence of the NADH/NAD+ driven regulatory feedback loop between SIRT3, complex I (MRC), and acetyl-CoA synthetases, and existence of the nuclear substrates of SIRT3. Unexplored functions of SIRT3 substrates such as LMNA and LMNB; HIF-1a, p53, DNA-PK, and PARK7 are highlighted for further scientific advances. SIRT3 acts as a repressor of BACE1 through the SIRT3-LKB1-AMPK-CREB-PGC1A-PPARG-BACE1 (SIRT3-BACE1), which functions are fitted the best by the Circadian Clock pathway.

In the Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain, the main components of the NVU undergo pathological changes. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) can protect neurons, induce changes in glial cells, regulate cerebral blood flow, and exert long-term neuroprotection. However, the mechanism by which tDCS improves NVU function is unclear. In this study, we explored the effect of tDCS on the NVU in mice with preclinical AD and the related mechanisms. 10 sessions of tDCS were given to six-month-old male APP/PS1 mice in the preclinical stage. The model group, sham stimulation group, and control group were made up of APP/PS1 mice and C57 mice of the same age. All mice were histologically evaluated two months after receiving tDCS. Protein content was measured using Western blotting and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The link between glial cells and blood vessels was studied using immunofluorescence staining and lectin staining. The results showed that tDCS affected the metabolism of Aβ; the levels of Aβ, amyloid precursor protein (APP) and BACE1 were significantly reduced, and the levels of ADAM10 were significantly increased in the frontal cortex and hippocampus in the stimulation group. In the stimulation group, tDCS reduced the protein levels of Iba1 and GFAP and increased the protein levels of NeuN, LRP1 and PDGRFβ. This suggests that tDCS can improve NVU function in APP/PS1 mice in the preclinical stage. Increased blood vessel density and blood vessel length, decreased IgG extravasation, and increased the protein levels of occludin and coverage of astrocyte foot processes with blood vessels suggested that tDCS had a protective effect on the blood-brain barrier. Furthermore, the increased numbers of Vimentin, S100 expression and blood vessels (lectin-positive) around Aβ indicated that the effect of tDCS was mediated by astrocytes and blood vessels. There was no significant difference in these parameters between the model group and the sham stimulation group. In conclusion, our results show that tDCS can improve NVU function in APP/PS1 mice in the preclinical stage, providing further support for the use of tDCS as a treatment for AD.","1663-4365","Frontiers in aging neuroscience","(14) 857415",2022,"Yinpei","Luo","Y","Chongqing Key Laboratory of Neurobiology, Department of Neurobiology, Army Medical University, Chongqing, China."

Activation of α7nAChR by GTS-21 has been indicated to reverse peripheral insulin resistance and exert neuroprotection. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to determine the effect of α7nAChR agonist (GTS-21) on intracerebroventricular administration of streptozotocin (ICV-STZ)-induced oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, cholinergic dysfunction, central insulin resistance and cognitive deficits. GTS-21 (1, 4 and 8 mg/kg; i.p.) was administered for 21 days following bilateral ICV-STZ administration (3 mg/kg) in C57BL/6 mice. Neurobehavioral assessments were performed using Morris water maze (MWM) and novel object recognition (NOR). Inflammatory markers (TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β) were determined using ELISA. Oxido-nitrosative stress (GSH, MDA and nitrite) and cholinergic activity (acetylcholine esterase and choline acetyltransferase) were estimated in the cortex and hippocampus through biochemical methods. Gene expression of insulin receptor (IR), IRS1, IRS2, BACE1, APP, PI3-K, AKT and GSK3β were determined by q-RT-PCR. ICV-STZ administration induced memory impairment, increased oxidative stress and neuroinflammation, and caused cholinergic dysfunction. Our results demonstrated that activation of α7nAChR by GTS-21 treatment improved memory in MWM and NOR test. Moreover, GTS-21 treatment significantly decreased oxido-nitrosative stress, inflammatory markers and cholinergic dysfunction in cortex and hippocampus. Finally, GTS-21 treatment restored ICV-STZ induced downregulation of IR, IRS1, IRS2, PI3-k, Akt and attenuated GSK3β, APP and BACE-1 indicating improved insulin signalling.

Thus, to address this, we computationally analysed a list of 533 BACE1 dependent proteins, identified from the literature, for potential BACE1 substrates, and compared them against proteins differentially expressed in AD. We identified 15 novel BACE1 substrates that were specifically altered in AD. To confirm our analysis, we validated Protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type D (PTPRD) and Netrin receptor DCC (DCC) using Western blotting. These findings shed light on the BACE1 inhibitor failings and could enable the design of substrate-specific inhibitors to target alternative BACE1 substrates. Furthermore, it gives us a greater understanding of the roles of BACE1 and its dysfunction in AD.","1422-0067","International journal of molecular sciences","4568",2022,"Hannah A","Taylor","HA","Leeds Institute of Cardiovascular and Metabolic Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Health, University of Leeds, Leeds LS2 9JT, UK."
35579602,"Transcytosis and trans-synaptic retention by postsynaptic ErbB4 underlie axonal accumulation of NRG3.","Neuregulins (NRGs) are EGF-like ligands associated with cognitive disorders. Unprocessed proNRG3 is cleaved by BACE1 to generate the mature membrane-bound NRG3 ligand, but the subcellular site of proNRG3 cleavage, mechanisms underlying its transport into axons, and presynaptic accumulation remain unknown. Using an optogenetic proNRG3 cleavage reporter (LA143-NRG3), we investigate the spatial-temporal dynamics of NRG3 processing and sorting in neurons. In dark conditions, unprocessed LA143-NRG3 is retained in the trans-Golgi network but, upon photoactivation, is cleaved by BACE1 and released from the TGN. Mature NRG3 then emerges on the somatodendritic plasma membrane from where it is re-endocytosed and anterogradely transported on Rab4+ vesicles into axons via transcytosis. By contrast, the BACE1 substrate APP is sorted into axons on Rab11+ vesicles. Lastly, by a mechanism we denote ""trans-synaptic retention,"" NRG3 accumulates at presynaptic terminals by stable interaction with its receptor ErbB4 on postsynaptic GABAergic interneurons. We propose that trans-synaptic retention may account for polarized expression of other neuronal transmembrane ligands and receptors.","1540-8140","The Journal of cell biology","e202110167",2022,"Tanveer","Ahmad","T","Section on Molecular Neurobiology, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Bethesda, MD."
35657793,"New compounds from heterocyclic amines scaffold with multitarget inhibitory activity on Aβ aggregation, AChE, and BACE1 in the Alzheimer disease.","The preset neurodegenerations in Alzheimer disease (AD) are due to several mechanisms such as amyloidogenic proteolysis, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, neurofibrillary tangles, cholinergic dysfunction, among others. The aim of this work was to develop multitarget molecules for the treatment of AD. Therefore, a family of 64 molecules was designed based on ligand structure pharmacophores able to inhibit the activity of beta secretase (BACE1) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) as well as to avoid amyloid beta (Aβ1-42) oligomerization. The backbone of designed molecules consisted of a trisubstituted aromatic ring, one of the substituents was a heterocyclic amine (piperidine, morpholine, pyrrolidine or N-methyl pyrrolidine) separated from the aromatic system by three carbon atoms. The set of compounds was screened in silico employing molecular docking calculations and chemoinformatic analyses. Based on Gibbs free energy of binding, binding mode and in silico predicted toxicity results, three of the best candidates were selected, synthesized, and evaluated in vitro; F3S4-m, F2S4-m, and F2S4-p. All three compounds prevented Aβ1-42 aggregation (F3S4-m in 30.5%, F2S4-p in 42.1%, and F2S4-m in 60.9%). Additionally, inhibitory activity against AChE (ki 0.40 μM and 0.19 μM) and BACE1 (IC50 15.97 μM and 8.38 μM) was also observed for compounds F2S4-m and F3S4-m, respectively. Despite the BACE IC50 results demonstrated that all compounds are very less potent respect to peptidomimetic inhibitor (PI-IV IC50 3.20 nM), we can still say that F3S4-m is capable to inhibit AChE and BACE1.","1932-6203","PloS one","(17) e0269129",2022,"Iohanan Daniel","García Marín","ID","Laboratorio de Biofísica y Biocatálisis, Escuela Superior de Medicina, Instituto Politécnico Nacional, Ciudad de México, México."

However, the effects of ECH in Alzheimer's disease (AD) are not very clear. This present study investigates the role and mechanism of ECH in the pathological process of AD. APP/PS1 mice treated with ECH in 50 mg/kg/day for 3 months. Morris water maze, nesting test, and immunofluorescence staining used to observe whether ECH could improve AD pathology. Western blot used to study the mechanism of ECH improving AD pathology. The results showed that ECH alleviated the memory impairment of APP/PS1 mice by reducing the time of escape latency as well as increasing the times of crossing the platform and rescued the impaired ability to construct nests. In addition, ECH significantly reduced the deposition of senile plaques in the brain and decreased the expression of BACE1 in APP/PS1 mice through activating PI3K/AKT/Nrf2/PPARγ pathway. Furthermore, ECH decreased ROS formation, GP91 and 8-OHdG expression, upregulated the expression of SOD1 and SOD2 as well as activating the PI3K/AKT/Nrf2 signaling pathway. Moreover, ECH inhibited glia cells activation, pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1β and TNF-α release, NLRP3 inflammasome formation through TXNIP/Trx-1 signaling pathway. In conclusion, this paper reported that ECH improved cognitive function, inhibited oxidative stress, and inflammatory response in AD.

Z-Guggulsterone (Z-GS) is a natural steroid, which is extracted from Commiphora mukul and has anti-inflammatory effects in vivo and in vitro. In the present study, we investigated the disease-modifying effects of chronic Z-GS administration on the cognitive and neuropathological impairments in the transgenic mouse models of AD. We found that chronic Z-GS administration prevented learning and memory deficits in the APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. In addition, Z-GS treatment significantly decreased cerebral amyloid-β (Aβ) levels and plaque burden via inhibiting amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing by reducing beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) expression in the APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. We also found that Z-GS treatment markedly alleviated neuroinflammation and reduced synaptic defects in the APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. Furthermore, the activated TLR4/NF-κB signaling pathways in APPswe/PS1dE9 mice were remarkably inhibited by Z-GS treatment, which was achieved via suppressing the phosphorylation of JNK. Collectively, our data demonstrate that chronic Z-GS treatment restores cognitive defects and reverses multiple neuropathological impairments in the APPswe/PS1dE9 mice. This study provides novel insights into the neuroprotective effects and neurobiological mechanisms of Z-GS on AD, indicating that Z-GS is a promising disease-modifying agent for the treatment of AD.","1873-2968","Biochemical pharmacology","(202) 115149",2022,"Jing","Liu","J","Institute of Geriatrics, the Second Medical Center and National Clinical Research Center of Geriatric Diseases, Chinese PLA General Hospital, Beijing 100853, China."

The mice in this experiment were divided into the normal group, model group, low-(25 mg·kg~(-1)), medium-(50 mg·kg~(-1)), and high-dose(100 mg·kg~(-1)) galangin groups, donepezil(3 mg·kg~(-1)) group, Akt inhibitor(25 mg·kg~(-1)) group, and autophagy inhibitor(30 mg·kg~(-1)) group, with ten in each group, and administered with the corresponding drugs for 30 successive days. On the 24 th day of medication, the water maze and dark avoidance tests were performed. The levels of p-tau, β-amyloid peptide 1-42(Aβ_(42)), acetylcholinesterase(AChE), β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1(BACE1), and amyloid precursor protein(APP) in hippocampus were detected by ELISA, the Beclin-1 mRNA expression by RT-PCR, the expression of Aβ_(42) and glial fibrillary acidic protein(GFAP) by immunohistochemistry, and the expression of myocyte enhancer factor 2 D(MEF2 D) by immunofluorescence assay. The pathological changes in hippocampus were observed after HE staining, and the expression of Akt, MEF2 D, and Beclin-1 in hippocampus were assayed by Western blot. These results showed that compared with the normal group, the model group exhibited prolonged swimming time, increased number of errors and electric shocks, up-regulated p-tau, Aβ_(42), APP, AChE, BACE1, GFAP, and Beclin-1, shortened incubation period, decreased p-Akt and MEF2 D, and obvious hippocampal injury. Compared with the model group, donepezil and galangin shortened the swimming time, reduced the number of errors and electric shocks, down-regulated the expression of p-tau, Aβ_(42), APP, AChE, BACE1, GFAP, and Beclin-1, prolonged the incubation period, up-regulated p-Akt and MEF2 D, and improved the pathological changes in hippocampus. Compared with the autophagy inhibitor group, galangin prolonged the swimming time, elevated the number of errors and electric shocks, enhanced the expression of p-tau, Aβ_(42), APP, AChE, BACE1, GFAP, and Beclin-1, shortened the incubation period, and diminished the expression of p-Akt and MEF2 D.

In the present study, we explored the neuroprotective effect and the potential mechanisms of arctigenin against LPS-evoked neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration, and memory impairments in the mice hippocampus. Daily administration of arctigenin (50 mg/kg per day, i.g.) for 28 days revealed noticeable improvements in spatial learning and memory deficits after exposure to LPS treatment. Arctigenin prevented LPS-induced neuronal/synaptic injury and inhibited the increases in Abeta (Aβ) generation and the levels of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and β-site amyloid precursor protein cleavage enzyme 1 (BACE1). Moreover, arctigenin treatment also suppressed glial activation and reduced the production of proinflammatory cytokines. In LPS-treated BV-2 microglial cells and mice, activation of the TLR4 mediated NF-κB signaling pathway was significantly suppressed by arctigenin administration. Mechanistically, arctigenin reduced the LPS-induced interaction of adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1) with TLR4 and its coreceptor CD14 and inhibited the TLR4-mediated downstream inflammatory response. The outcomes of the current study indicate that arctigenin mitigates LPS-induced apoptotic neurodegeneration, amyloidogenesis and neuroinflammation as well as cognitive impairments, and suggest that arctigenin may be a potential therapeutic candidate for neuroinflammation/neurodegeneration-related diseases.","1573-7365","Metabolic brain disease","(37) 2039-2052",2022,"Quan","Yuan","Q","School of Basic Medical Sciences, Henan University of Science and Technology, No. 263, Kaiyuan Avenue, Luolong District, Luoyang, 471023, China."

D-Galactose (D-gal) evokes severe oxidative stress and mimics normal aging in animals. Curcumin, a natural flavonoid, has potent antioxidant and anti-aging properties. There are several proteins like glutathione S-transferase A1 (GSTA1), glutathione S-transferase omega-1 (GSTO1), kelch-like ECH-associated protein 1 (KEAP1), beta-secretase 1 (BACE1), and amine oxidase [flavin-containing] A (MAOA) are commonly involved in oxidative stress and aging. This study aimed to investigate the interaction of curcumin to these proteins and their subsequent effect on aging-associated memory impairment in two robust animal models: D-Gal and normal aged (NA) mice. The aging mice model was developed by administering D-gal intraperitoneally (i.p). Mice (n = 64) were divided into the eight groups (8 mice in each group): Vehicle, Curcumin-Control, D-gal (100mg/kg; i.p), Curcumin + D-gal, Astaxanthin (Ast) + D-gal, Normal Aged (NA), Curcumin (30mg/kg Orally) + NA, Ast (20mg/kg Orally) + NA. Retention and freezing memories were assessed by passive avoidance (PA) and contextual fear conditioning (CFC). Molecular docking was performed to predict curcumin binding with potential molecular targets. Curcumin significantly increased retention time (p < 0.05) and freezing response (p < 0.05) in PA and CFC, respectively. Curcumin profoundly ameliorated the levels of glutathione, superoxide dismutase, catalase, advanced oxidation protein products, nitric oxide, and lipid peroxidation in mice hippocampi. In silico studies revealed favorable binding energies of curcumin with GSTA1, GSTO1, KEAP1, BACE1, and MAOA. Curcumin improves retention and freezing memory in D-gal and nature-induced aging mice. Curcumin ameliorates the levels of oxidative stress biomarkers in mice. Anti-aging effects of curcumin could be attributed to, at least partially, the upregulation of antioxidant enzymes through binding with GSTA1, GSTO1, KEAP1, and inhibition of oxidative damage through binding with BACE1 and MAOA.","1932-6203","PloS one","(17) e0270123",2022,"Md Ashrafur","Rahman","MA","Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences, North South University, Bashundhara, Dhaka, Bangladesh."

Nasal administration provides an effective way to deliver drugs directly into the brain through the nose-to-brain pathway. AAL, specifically binding to L-fucose located in the olfactory epithelium, endows Rapa@DAK/siRNA with high brain entry efficiency through intranasal administration. KLVFF peptide as an Aβ targeting ligand and aggregation inhibitor enables nanoparticles to bind with Aβ, inhibit Aβ aggregation, and reduce toxicity. Meanwhile, the release of BACE1 siRNA and rapamycin is confirmed to reduce BACE1 expression, promote autophagy, and reduce Aβ deposition.

The LPS was administered once per week and TA twice a week to adult male mice for three months consecutively. Behavioral studies were performed using different behavioral models such as balance beam, novel object recognition (NOR), Morris water maze (MWM), and Y-maze tests. The protein expression of different mediators such as TNF-α, p-JNK, pIRS636, BACE1, APP, and Aβ was evaluated through western blot and immunofluorescence staining techniques. Biochemical assays were carried out to assess the antioxidant activities of TA. The computational study was conducted to predict the binding mode of TA with target sites of TNF-α. Behavioral studies showed that the TA-treated mice exhibited gradual memory improvement. TA significantly inhibited BACE1 activity and reduced production and accumulation of Aβ in the hippocampus of mice brains. Moreover, the TA significantly inhibited LPS-induced ROS production and enhanced the glutathione levels. Furthermore, we have shown via the computational method for the first time that TA inhibits LPS-triggered TNF-ὰ and its downstream signaling to reduce AD pathology including memory impairment, neuroinflammation, insulin signaling impairment, and Aβ deposition in adult mice.

We focused on the known double inhibitory loop involving the cellular prion protein (PrPC) and the enzyme BACE1 that produces amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides. BACE1 is inhibited by PrPC, but its inhibitory activity is lost when PrPC binds to Aβ oligomers (Aβo). Excessive Aβo formation would switch the loop to a pathogenic condition involving the Aβo-PrPC-mGluR5 complex, Fyn kinase activation, tau, and NMDAR phosphorylation, ultimately leading to neurodegeneration. Based on the emerging role of cyclic nucleotides in Aβ production, and thereby in synaptic plasticity and cognitive processes, cAMP and cGMP can be considered as modulatory factors capable of inducing the transition from a physiological steady state to a pathogenic one. This would imply that critical pharmacological targets for AD treatment lie within pathways that lead to an imbalance of cyclic nucleotides in neurons. If this hypothesis is confirmed, it will provide precise indications for the development of preventive or therapeutic treatments for the disease.","1422-0067","International journal of molecular sciences","7061",2022,"Bruno","Burlando","B","Department of Pharmacy (DIFAR), University of Genoa, 16132 Genoa, Italy."

According to this hypothesis, the formation of plaques precedes the appearance of fibrillary tangles. Therapeutic agents able to inhibit the formation of plaques are therefore considered as potential disease-modifying treatments (DMT) that could prevent or limit the progression of AD. Plaques are deposits formed by aggregates of amyloid-β (Aβ)-peptides. These peptides are metabolites of amyloid precursor protein (APP) first mediated by two enzymes: β-secretase 1 (BACE1) and γ-secretase. Molecular identification of these two enzymes has stimulated the development of their inhibitors. The clinical testing of these two classes of molecules has not been successful to date. The oligomerization of Aβ-peptides into plaques is now targeted by immunological approaches such as antibodies and vaccines. Structural consideration of the Aβ-peptide sequence led to the launch of the antibody Aducanumab. Several other antibodies are in late clinical phases. Progress in the understanding of the effects of N-truncated Aβ-peptides such as pE3-42, formed by the action of recently well characterized enzymes (aminopeptidase A, dipeptidylpeptidase-4 and glutaminyl cyclase) suggests that oligomerization can be limited either by enzyme inhibitors or antibody approaches.

Chronic administration of D-gal causes neuroinflammation leading to cognitive deficit and memory impairment which represent Alzheimer's dementia. In present study, we investigated the neuroprotective effects of the natural phenol, p-Coumaric acid (PCA) and its underlying mechanism in the chronic D-gal treated mice. Subcutaneous administration of D-gal (150 mg/kg) to Swiss albino mice for 42 consecutive days resulted in cognitive impairment as observed in Morris water maize (MWM) and Y maze test, which was ameliorated by concurrent treatment with PCA (80 mg/kg, and 100 mg/kg, p.o.). Importantly, PCA treatment attenuated the D-gal induced oxidative stress and significantly inhibited acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity in mice brain. Furthermore, PCA treatment significantly lowered levels of inflammatory marker nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) and reduced levels of proapoptotic enzyme caspase3. We also observed that PCA treatment exhibited β-secretase enzyme (BACE1) inhibitory effect. However, our results revealed that PCA treatment failed to decrease the level of advanced glycation end products both in vitro and in vivo. Taken together, current study demonstrated the significant neuroprotective effect of PCA against D-gal induced oxidative stress, neuroinflammation, cognitive impairment and apoptosis.","1573-7365","Metabolic brain disease","(37) 2569-2579",2022,"Pratibha Atul","Daroi","PA","Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Technology, Institute of Chemical Technology, Nathalal Parekh Marg, Matunga, Mumbai, Maharashtra, India."

In this study, we established the postmenopausal estrogen-deficient model by ovariectomy (OVX). Then, we used high-throughput Affymetrix Clariom transcriptomics and found 143 differentially expressed genes in the hippocampus of OVX mice with the absolute fold change ≥ 1.5 and P < 0.05. GO analysis showed that the highest enrichment was seen in long-term memory. Combined with the response to steroid hormone enrichment and GeneMANIA network prediction, the serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase 1 gene (Sgk1) was found to be the most potent candidate for ovarian estrogenic regulation. Sgk1 overexpression viral vectors (oSgk1) were then constructed and injected into the hippocampus of OVX mice. Morris water maze test revealed that the impaired spatial learning and memory induced by OVX was rescued by Sgk1 overexpression. Additionally, the altered expression of synaptic proteins and actin remodeling proteins and changes in CA1 spine density and synapse density induced by OVX were also significantly reversed by oSgk1. Moreover, the OVX-induced increase in Aβ-producing BACE1 and Aβ and the decrease in insulin degrading enzyme were significantly reversed by oSgk1. The above results show that multiple pathways and genes are involved in ovarian estrogenic regulation of the function of the hippocampus, among which Sgk1 may be a novel potent target against estrogen-sensitive hippocampal dysfunctions, such as Aβ-initiated AD.","1573-6903","Neurochemical research","(47) 3369-3384",2022,"Mengying","Liu","M","The 305 Hospital of PLA, Beijing, 100017, China."

The impact of environmental factors on the genetic mutation in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) is not well characterized. We hypothesized that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress would promote disease for the patient carrying the APP D678H mutation. Therefore, we analyzed the impact of a familial AD mutation on amyloid precursor protein (APP D678H) under ER stress. Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from APP D678H mutant carrier was differentiated into neurons, which were then analyzed for AD-like changes. Immunocytochemistry and whole-cell patch-clamp recording revealed that the derived neurons on day 28 after differentiation showed neuronal markers and electrophysiological properties similar to those of mature neurons. However, the APP D678H mutant neurons did not have significant alterations in the levels of amyloid-β (Aβ) and phosphorylated tau (pTau) compared to its isogenic wild-type neurons. Only under ER stress, the neurons with the APP D678H mutation had more Aβ and pTau via immune detection assays. The higher level of Aβ in the APP D678H mutant neurons was probably due to the increased level of β-site APP cleaving enzyme (BACE1) and decreased level of Aβ-degrading enzymes under ER stress. Increased Aβ and pTau under ER stress reduced the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) in Western blot analysis and altered electrophysiological properties in the mutant neurons. Our study provides evidence that the interaction between genetic mutation and ER stress would induce AD-like changes.

The docking calculations alone achieved solid enrichment of active compounds over decoys. Encouragingly, the ABFE calculations then improved on this baseline.

Nonetheless, data about the deleterious consequences of MET on water organisms are still scarce and require further investigation. Herein, we aimed to establish whether or not chronic exposure to MET (1, 20, and 40 μg/L) may alter the swimming behavior and induce neurotoxicity in Danio rerio adults. After 4 months of exposure, MET-exposed fish exhibited less swimming activity when compared to control fish. Moreover, compared with the control group, MET significantly inhibited the activity of AChE and induced oxidative damage in the brain of fish. Concerning gene expression, MET significantly upregulated the expression of Nrf1, Nrf2, BAX, p53, BACE1, APP, PSEN1, and downregulated CASP3 and CASP9. Although MET did not overexpress the CASP3 gene, we saw a meaningful rise in the activity of this enzyme in the blood of fish exposed to MET compared to the control group, which we then confirmed by a high number of apoptotic cells in the TUNEL assay. Our findings demonstrate that chronic exposure to MET may impair fish swimming behavior, making them more vulnerable to predators.","1879-1026","The Science of the total environment","(849) 157888",2022,"Gustavo Axel","Elizalde-Velázquez","GA","Laboratorio de Toxicología Ambiental, Facultad de Química, Universidad Autónoma del Estado de México, Paseo Colón intersección Paseo Tollocan, Colonia Residencial Colón, CP 50120 Toluca, Estado de México, Mexico."

Recent findings indicate that some of the damaging effects of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, especially in the brain, may be induced by the spike protein, leading to the disruption of the initial blood-brain barrier (BBB). SARS-CoV-2-infected cells and animals exhibit age-dependent pathogenesis. In this study, we identified endothelial BACE1 as a critical mediator of BBB disruption and cellular senescence induced by the SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 subunit protein. Increased BACE1 in human brain microvascular endothelial cells (HBMVEC) decreases the levels of tight junction proteins, including ZO-1, occludin, and claudins. Moreover, BACE1 overexpression leads to the accumulation of p16 and p21, typical hallmarks of cellular senescence. Our findings show that the SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 subunit protein upregulated BACE1 expression in HBMVECs, causing endothelial leakage. In addition, the SARS-CoV-2 spike S1 subunit protein induced p16 and p21 expression, indicating BACE1-mediated cellular senescence, confirmed by β-Gal staining in HBMVECs.

Since BACE1 cleaves a plethora of other substrates, in this work we investigated whether the proteolysis and/or distribution of other BACE1 substrates, such as seizure protein 6 (Sez6) and seizure 6-like protein (Sez6L), is altered in AD. To test this we used 5xFAD mouse model brains that show an early accumulation of Aß plaques already at 2-months of age. Here we show for the first time that accumulation of BACE1 in peri-plaque regions and its enhanced levels in AD brains does not affect proteolysis of BACE1 substrates other than APP, such as Sez6 and Sez6L. We observed altered distribution of Sez6 and Sez6L in the area of Aß plaques in 5xFAD brains which is distinct to that of APP, BACE1 and/or LAMP1, suggesting different localization and/or function of these BACE1 substrates. While it is necessary to further elucidate the potential role that this may play in the course of AD, it is likely that Aß-targeted therapies may have beneficial effects against accumulation and/or altered distribution of BACE1 and its substrates, in addition to APP.","1872-6216","Mechanisms of ageing and development","(207) 111726",2022,"Kristina","Dominko","K","Laboratory for Neurodegenerative Disease Research, Rudjer Boskovic Institute, Zagreb, Croatia."

However, the traditional two-dimension (2D) cell culture which grows cells on a flat surface does not fully recapitulate the pathological phenotypes. Alternatively, the three-dimension (3D) cell culture provides cell-cell and cell-ECM interaction that better mimics tissue-like structure. Thus, it has gained increasing attention recently. Yet, the expenses, time-consuming, and complications of cellular and biomolecular analysis are still major limitations of 3D culture. Herein, we describe a cost-effective and simplified workflow of the 3D neuronal cell-laden agarose-laminin preparation and the isolation of cells, RNAs, and proteins from the scaffold. To study the effects of the amyloidogenic condition in neurons, we utilized a neuron-like cell line, SH-SY5Y, and induced the amyloidogenic condition by using an amyloid forty-two inducer (Aftin-4). The effectiveness of RNAs, proteins and cells isolation from 3D scaffold enables us to investigate the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying amyloidogenic cascade in neuronal cells. The results show that SH-SY5Y cultured in agarose-laminin scaffold differentiated to a mature TUJ1-expressing neuron cell on day 7. Furthermore, the gene expression profile from the Aftin-4-induced amyloidogenic condition revealed the expression of relevant gene-encoding proteins in the amyloidogenic pathway, including APP, BACE1, PS1, and PS2. This platform could induce the amyloid-beta 42 secretion and entrap secreted proteins in the scaffold. The induction of amyloidogenic conditions in a 3D culture facilitates the interaction between secreted amyloid-beta and neurons, which makes it resembles the pathological environment in Alzheimer's brain. Together, this workflow is applicable for studying the cellular and molecular analysis of amyloid-induced neuronal toxicity, such as those occurred in Alzheimer's disease progression.

TBO also decreased the levels of both total tau and phosphorylated tau at residues Ser202/Thr205, Thr181, Ser396 and Ser 396/Ser404. Moreover, when the possible mechanisms underlying its effects on tau pathology were explored, TBO was found to decrease tau phosphorylation at those sites by reducing the expression levels of Akt, GSK-3β, Cdk5, inactive p-PP2A and increasing the expression levels of p-Akt Ser473 and inactive p-GSK-3β Ser9.

The global dementia prevalence is approximately 47 million, which may increase by three times by 2050. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia. AD is a severe age-related neurodegenerative disorder characterized by short-term memory loss, aphasia, mood imbalance, and executive function. The etiology of AD is still unknown, and the exact origin of the disease is still under investigation. Aggregation of Amyloid β (Aβ) plaques or neurotoxic Aβo oligomers outside the neuron is the most common cause of AD development. Amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing by β secretase and γ secretase produces abnormal Aβ monomers. This aggregation of Aβ and NFT is promoted by various genes like BACE1, ADAM10, PIN1, GSK-3, APOE, PPARα, etc. Identification of these genes can discover several therapeutic targets that can be useful in studying pathogenesis and underlying treatments. Melatonin modulates the activities of these genes, thereby reducing Aβ production and increasing its clearance. Melatonin also reduces the expression of APP by attenuating cAMP, thereby enhancing the non-amyloidogenic process.

Thus, we investigated the anti-Alzheimer's disease (anti-AD) potential of 16 ellagitannin and gallotannin, and nine anthocyanin derivatives' inhibition of BACE1, AChE, and BChE, and gallagic acid inhibited both the best. Further, a kinetic study identified different modes of inhibition, and a molecular docking simulation revealed that active compounds inhibited these three enzymes with low binding energy through hydrophilic and hydrophobic interactions in the active site cavities. Gallagic acid and castalagin decreased Aβ peptides secretion from neuroblastoma cells that overexpressed human β-amyloid precursor protein significantly by 10 μM. Further, treatment with gallagic acid and castalagin reduced BACE1 and APPsβ expression levels significantly without affecting amyloid precursor protein (APP) levels in the amyloidogenic pathway. Co-incubation of Aβ42 with gallagic acid reduced Aβ42-induced intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production significantly. Our results suggest that pomegranate constituents, specifically gallagic acid, may be useful in developing therapeutic treatment modalities for AD.","1090-2120","Bioorganic chemistry","(129) 106137",2022,"Md","Yousof Ali","M","Department of Physiology and Pharmacology, Hotchkiss Brain Institute and Alberta Children's Hospital Research Institute, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB T2N 4N1, Canada.

36151369,"Spatial Analysis of Neural Cell Proteomic Profiles Following Ischemic Stroke in Mice Using High-Plex Digital Spatial Profiling.","Stroke is ranked as the fifth leading cause of death and the leading cause of adult disability in the USA. The progression of neuronal damage after stroke is recognized to be a complex integration of glia, neurons, and the surrounding extracellular matrix, therefore potential treatments must target the detrimental effects created by these interactions. In this study, we examined the spatial cellular and neuroinflammatory mechanisms occurring early after ischemic stroke utilizing Nanostring Digital Spatial Profiling (DSP) technology. Male C57bl/6 mice were subjected to photothrombotic middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) and sacrificed at 3 days post-ischemia. Spatial distinction of the ipsilateral hemisphere was studied according to the regions of interest: the ischemic core, peri-infarct tissues, and peri-infarct normal tissue (PiNT) in comparison to the contralateral hemisphere. We demonstrated that the ipsilateral hemisphere initiates distinct spatial regulatory proteomic profiles with DSP technology that can be identified consistently with the immunohistochemical markers, FJB, GFAP, and Iba-1. The core border profile demonstrated an induction of neuronal death, apoptosis, autophagy, immunoreactivity, and early degenerative proteins. Most notably, the core border resulted in a decrease of the neuronal proteins Map2 and NeuN; an increase in the autophagy proteins BAG3 and CTSD; an increase in the microglial and peripheral immune invasion proteins Iba1, CD45, CD11b, and CD39; and an increase in the neurodegenerative proteins BACE1, APP, amyloid β 1-42, ApoE, and hyperphosphorylated tau protein S-199. The peri-infarct region demonstrated increased astrocytic, immunoreactivity, apoptotic, and neurodegenerative proteomic profiles, with an increase in BAG3, GFAP, and hyperphosphorylated tau protein S-199. The PiNT region displayed minimal changes compared to the contralateral cortex with only an increase in GFAP. In this study, we showed that mechanisms known to be associated with stroke, such as apoptosis and inflammation, occur in distinct spatial domains of the injured brain following ischemia. We also demonstrated the dysregulation of specific autophagic pathways that may lead to neurodegeneration in peri-infarct brain tissues. Taken together, these data suggest that identifying post-ischemic mechanisms occurring in a spatiotemporal manner may lead to more precise targets for successful therapeutic interventions to treat stroke.","1559-1182","Molecular neurobiology","(59) 7236-7252",2022,"Jessica M","Noll","JM","Division of Biomedical Sciences, University of California-Riverside School of Medicine, 900 University Ave, Riverside, CA, 92521, USA."
36158539,"Clinical relevance of biomarkers, new therapeutic approaches, and role of post-translational modifications in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that causes progressive loss of cognitive functions like thinking, memory, reasoning, behavioral abilities, and social skills thus affecting the ability of a person to perform normal daily functions independently. There is no definitive cure for this disease, and treatment options available for the management of the disease are not very effective as well. Based on histopathology, AD is characterized by the accumulation of insoluble deposits of amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Although several molecular events contribute to the formation of these insoluble deposits, the aberrant post-translational modifications (PTMs) of AD-related proteins (like APP, Aβ, tau, and BACE1) are also known to be involved in the onset and progression of this disease. However, early diagnosis of the disease as well as the development of effective therapeutic approaches is impeded by lack of proper clinical biomarkers. In this review, we summarized the current status and clinical relevance of biomarkers from cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), blood and extracellular vesicles involved in onset and progression of AD. Moreover, we highlight the effects of several PTMs on the AD-related proteins, and provide an insight how these modifications impact the structure and function of proteins leading to AD pathology. Finally, for disease-modifying therapeutics, novel approaches, and targets are discussed for the successful treatment and management of AD.","1663-4365","Frontiers in aging neuroscience","(14) 977411",2022,"Ibtisam","Mumtaz","I","Laboratory of Nanotherapeutics and Regenerative Medicine, Department of Nanotechnology, University of Kashmir, Srinagar, India."

Therefore, inhibiting BACE1 activity has become a potential therapeutic strategy for AD. The development of reliable detection methods for BACE1 activity plays an important role in early diagnosis of AD and evaluation of the therapeutic effect of new drugs for AD.

These disorders, termed HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND), possess neuropathologic similarities to Alzheimer's disease (AD), including intra- and extracellular amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptide aggregates. Aβ peptide is produced through cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by the beta secretase BACE1. However, this is precluded by cleavage of APP by the non-amyloidogenic alpha secretase, ADAM10. Previous studies have found that BACE1 expression was increased in the CNS of PWH with HAND as well as animal models of HAND. Further, BACE1 contributed to neurotoxicity. Yet in in vitro models, the role of ADAM10 and its potential regulatory mechanisms had not been examined. To address this, primary rat cortical neurons were treated with supernatants from HIV-infected human macrophages (HIV/MDMs). We found that HIV/MDMs decreased levels of both ADAM10 and Sirtuin1 (SIRT1), a regulator of ADAM10 that is implicated in aging and in AD. Both decreases were blocked with NMDA receptor antagonists, and treatment with NMDA was sufficient to induce reduction in ADAM10 and SIRT1 protein levels. Furthermore, decreases in SIRT1 protein levels were observed at an earlier time point than the decreases in ADAM10 protein levels, and the reduction in SIRT1 was reversed by proteasome inhibitor MG132. This study indicates that HIV-associated insults, particularly excitotoxicity, contribute to changes of APP secretases by downregulating levels of ADAM10 and its regulator.","2073-4409","Cells","2962",2022,"Claudia","Lopez Lloreda","C","Department of Neuroscience, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104, USA."

The hypometabolic state associated with chronic thiamine insufficiency (TI) has been demonstrated to be a contributor towards the development of amyloid plaque deposition and neurotoxicity. However, the molecular mechanism underlying TI induced AD pathology is still unresolved. Previously, we have established that TI stabilizes the metabolic stress transcriptional factor, Hypoxia Inducible Factor-1α (HIF1α). Utilizing neuronal hippocampal cells (HT22), TI-induced HIF1α activation triggered the amyloidogenic cascade through transcriptional expression and increased activity of β-secretase (BACE1). Knockdown and pharmacological inhibition of HIF1α during TI significantly reduced BACE1 and C-terminal Fragment of 99 amino acids (C99) formation. TI also increased the expression of the HIF1α regulated pro-apoptotic protein, BCL2/adenovirus E1B 19 kDa protein-interacting protein (BNIP3). Correspondingly, cell toxicity during TI conditions was significantly reduced with HIF1α and BNIP3 knockdown. The role of BNIP3 in TI-mediated toxicity was further highlighted by localization of dimeric BNIP3 into the mitochondria and nuclear accumulation of Endonuclease G. Subsequently, TI decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and enhanced chromatin fragmentation. However, cell toxicity via the HIF1α/BNIP3 cascade required TI induced oxidative stress. HIF1α, BACE1 and BNIP3 expression was induced in 3xTg-AD mice after TI and administration with the HIF1α inhibitor YC1 significantly attenuated HIF1α and target genes levels in vivo. Overall, these findings demonstrate a critical stress response during TI involving the induction of HIF1α transcriptional activity that directly promotes neurotoxicity and AD-like pathology.","1095-9327","Molecular and cellular neurosciences","(123) 103785",2022,"Maria Luisa","Valle","ML","Department of Pharmaceutical and Biomedical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, United States."
36251052,"The BACE1-generated C-terminal fragment of the neural cell adhesion molecule 2 (NCAM2) promotes BACE1 targeting to Rab11-positive endosomes.","Beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), also known as β-secretase, is an aspartic protease. The sorting of this enzyme into Rab11-positive recycling endosomes regulates the BACE1-mediated cleavage of its substrates, however, the mechanisms underlying this targeting remain poorly understood. The neural cell adhesion molecule 2 (NCAM2) is a substrate of BACE1. We show that BACE1 cleaves NCAM2 in cultured hippocampal neurons and NCAM2-transfected CHO cells. The C-terminal fragment of NCAM2 that comprises the intracellular domain and a small portion of NCAM2's extracellular domain, associates with BACE1. This association is not affected in cells with inhibited endocytosis, indicating that the interaction of NCAM2 and BACE1 precedes the targeting of BACE1 from the cell surface to endosomes. In neurons and CHO cells, this fragment and BACE1 co-localize in Rab11-positive endosomes. Overexpression of full-length NCAM2 or a recombinant NCAM2 fragment containing the transmembrane and intracellular domains but lacking the extracellular domain leads to an increase in BACE1 levels in these organelles. In NCAM2-deficient neurons, the levels of BACE1 are increased at the cell surface and reduced in intracellular organelles. These effects are correlated with increased levels of the soluble extracellular domain of BACE1 in the brains of NCAM2-deficient mice, suggesting increased shedding of BACE1 from the cell surface. Of note, shedding of the extracellular domain of Sez6, a protein cleaved exclusively by BACE1, is reduced in NCAM2-deficient animals. These results indicate that the BACE1-generated fragment of NCAM2 regulates BACE1 activity by promoting the targeting of BACE1 to Rab11-positive endosomes.","1420-9071","Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS","(79) 555",2022,"Ryan","Keable","R","School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW, 2052, Australia."

Plants with potent activities were further characterised using a recently developed in vivo model of AD, Globodera pallida. The ability of phytoextracts to protect this organism against amyloid-beta Aβ (1-42) exposure was assessed by measuring chemosensing, survival rate, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and antioxidant responses. Extracts (n = 5) from Juglans regia (leaves), Ellettaria cardamomum (seeds), Cinnamomum zeylanicum (bark), Salvia officinalis (leaves/flowers), and Hypericum perforatum (flowers) exerted concentration-dependent inhibitory activities against AChE and BuChE.

Amyloid-β plaques and tau aggregates have been observed in the post-mortem brains of TBI patients; however, the mechanisms leading to AD neuropathology in TBI are still unknown. In this study, we hypothesized that focal TBI induces changes in miRNA expression in and around affected areas, resulting in the altered expression of genes involved in neurodegeneration and AD pathology. For this purpose, we performed a miRNA array in extracts from rats subjected to experimental TBI, using the controlled cortical impact (CCI) model. In and around the contusion, we observed alterations of miRNAs associated with dementia/AD, compared to the contralateral side. Specifically, the expression of miR-9 was significantly upregulated, while miR-29b, miR-34a, miR-106b, miR-181a and miR-107 were downregulated. Via qPCR, we confirmed these results in an additional group of injured rats when compared to naïve animals. Interestingly, the changes in those miRNAs were concomitant with alterations in the gene expression of mRNAs involved in amyloid generation and tau pathology, such as β-APP cleaving enzyme (BACE1) and Glycogen synthase-3-β (GSK3β). In addition increased levels of neuroinflammatory markers (TNF-α), glial activation, neuronal loss, and tau phosphorylation were observed in pericontusional areas. Therefore, our results suggest that the secondary injury cascade in TBI affects miRNAs regulating the expression of genes involved in AD dementia.","2218-273X","Biomolecules","1457",2022,"Shahmir","Naseer","S","Department of Brain Sciences, Imperial College London, Hammersmith Hospital, Du Cane Road, London W12 0NN, UK."

On the basis of the aglycone part, saponins are classified into triterpenoid glycosides, steroid glycosides and alkaloid glycosides. Saponins exhibit neuroprotective activities against various disorders of the central nervous system (CNS) including stroke, Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease (HD) and Parkinson's disease (PD).

TMAO impaired learning and memory abilities, and exercise reversed TMAO induced cognitive impairment. Serum TMAO, choline, betaine and TMA were significantly elevated from TMAO group, while exercise group had decreased TMAO, betaine and TMA level. TMAO group has significantly upregulated BACE1 from both hippocampus and cortex, also increased cathepsin B, p-Tau at Ser396&Ser404, GFAP, p-NF-κB p65 in cortex, while reduced BDNF, synaptophysin and PSD95 in hippocampus, also reduced occludin and ZO-1 from cortex, and reduced occludin from colon. In contrast, BACE1 from both hippocampus and cortex, also cathepsin B and p-Tauser396 from cortex were reduced, BDNF, snaptophysin, and PSD95 from hippocampus, ZO-1 from cortex, and occludin from colon were elevated post exercise compared to TMAO group. Exercise elevated α diversity index of cecal content, and TMAO and exercise affected gut microbiota profiles differentially. In conclusion, TMAO led to gut microbiota dysbiosis, impaired gut-brain integrity, elevated neuroinflammation, Aβ pathology and tau phosphorylation, disordered synaptic function; and exercise could reverse TMAO induced cognitive dysfunction via improving the above markers. The potential deleterious effects of TMAO on cognitive function need to be validated in humans, also dosages of exercise for exerting neuroprotective effects against TMAO induced cognitive impairment.","1872-9754","Neurochemistry international","(162) 105459",2023,"Ying","Zhang","Y","School of Public Health, Soochow University, 199 Ren'ai Road, Suzhou, 215123, China."

This aggravating disease involves the aberrant production of β amyloid plaques by BACE1 which catalyzes the rate-limiting step by cleaving the amyloid precursor protein (APP), generating the neurotoxic amyloid β protein that aggregates to form plaques leading to neurodegeneration. Therefore, it is indispensable to inhibit BACE1, thus modulating the APP processing. In this study, we present a workflow that utilizes a multi-stage virtual screening protocol for identifying potential BACE1 inhibitors by employing multiple artificial neural network-based models. Collectively, all the hyperparameter tuned models were assigned a task to virtually screen Maybridge library, thus yielding a consensus of 41 hits. The majority of these hits exhibited optimal pharmacokinetic properties confirmed by high central nervous system multiparameter optimization (CNS-MPO) scores. Further shortlisting of 8 compounds by molecular docking into the active site of BACE1 and their subsequent in-vitro evaluation identified 4 compounds as potent BACE1 inhibitors with IC50 values falling in the range 0.028-0.052 μM and can be further optimized with medicinal chemistry efforts to improve their activity.","1868-1751","Molecular informatics","(42) e2200113",2023,"Kushagra","Kashyap","K","Biochemistry and Structural Biology Division, CSIR-Central Drug Research Institute (CSIR-CDRI), Sector 10, Jankipuram Extension, Sitapur Road, Lucknow, 226031, India."

Despite intensive research over several decades, controversies still surround the etiology of AD and the disease remains incurable. Meanwhile, new molecular players of the central amyloid cascade hypothesis have emerged and among these is a protease known as β-site APP cleavage enzyme 2 (BACE2). Unlike BACE1, BACE2 cleaves the amyloid-β protein precursor within the Aβ domain that accordingly prevents the generation of Aβ42 peptides, the aggregation of which is commonly regarded as the toxic entity that drives neurodegeneration in AD. Given this non-amyloidogenic role of BACE2, it is attractive to position BACE2 as a therapeutic target for AD. Indeed, several groups including ours have demonstrated a neuroprotective role for BACE2 in AD. In this review, we discuss emerging evidence supporting the ability of BACE2 in mitigating AD-associated pathology in various experimental systems including human pluripotent stem cell-derived cerebral organoid disease models. Alongside this, we also provide an update on the identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms occurring in the BACE2 gene that are linked to increased risk and earlier disease onset in the general population. In particular, we highlight a recently identified point mutation on BACE2 that apparently leads to sporadic early-onset AD. We believe that a better understanding of the role of BACE2 in AD would provide new insights for the development of viable therapeutic strategies for individuals with dementia.","1875-8908","Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD","(94) S159-S171",2023,"Yee Jie","Yeap","YJ","Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, Singapore."

Beta-amyloid (Aβ) formation and its accumulation in the brain constitute one of the pathological hallmarks of AD. Until now, how to modulate Aβ formation in hippocampal neurons remains a big challenge. Herein, we investigated whether the exosomal transfer of microRNA (miR) relates to amyloid pathology in the recipient neuron cells. We isolated circulating small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) from AD patients and healthy controls, determined the miR-342-5p level in the sEVs by RT-PCR, and evaluated its diagnostic performance in AD. Then, we took advantage of biomolecular assays to estimate the role of miR-342-5p in modulating the amyloid pathway, including amyloid precursor protein (APP), beta-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), and Aβ42. Furthermore, we subjected HT22 cells to the sEVs from the hippocampal tissues of transgenic APP mice (Exo-APP) or C57BL/6 littermates (Exo-CTL), and the Exo-APP enriched with miR-342-5p mimics or the control to assess the effect of the sEVs' delivery of miR-342-5p on Aβ formation. We observed a lower level of miR-342-5p in the circulating sEVs from AD patients compared with healthy controls. MiR-342-5p participated in Aβ formation by modulating BACE1 expression, specifically binding its 3'-untranslated region (UTR) sequence. Exo-APP distinctly promoted Aβ42 formation in the recipient cells compared to Exo-CTL. Intriguingly, miR-342-5p enrichment in Exo-APP ameliorated amyloid pathology in the recipient cells. Our study indicated that miR-342-5p was dysregulated in human circulating sEVs from AD patients; sEV transfer of miR-342-5p ameliorates Aβ formation by modulating BACE1 expression. These findings highlight the promising potential of exosomal miRNAs in AD clinical therapy.","2073-4409","Cells","3830",2022,"Zhiwu","Dong","Z","Department of Laboratory Medicine, Jinshan Branch of Shanghai Sixth People's Hospital, Jinshan District Central Hospital Affiliated to Shanghai University of Medicine & Health Sciences, Shanghai 201599, China."

Production and accumulation of amyloid-β peptide (Aβ) represent the major pathological event of the disease. The formation of amyloid- β results due to proteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme (BACE1) shown as the amyloid hypothesis, a prevalent theory for AD pathogenesis. Thus, BACE1 represents a novel target to decrease cerebral Aβ concentration and slow down the disease's progression. The structure-based drug design approach led to a wide variety of small molecules with the mechanism of action centered around inhibition of β-secretase protease (BACE1), which are shown to have drug-like properties and reduce brain Aβ levels. Based on transition state isosteres, BACE1 inhibitors can largely be classified as peptidomimetics and non-peptidomimetics. The subclasses of the two categories have been covered with different scaffolds like statin, norstatin, carbinamine, hydroxyethylene, hydroxyethylamine, acyl guanidine, 2- aminopyridine, aminoimidazole, aminohydantoin, aminothiazoline, aminooxazoline, aminoquinoline, piperazine-based.

The morphological changes of cortical cortex (such as, cortical thickness and surface area) in AD always accompany by the change of the functional connectivity to other brain regions and influence the short- and long-range brain network connections, causing functional deficits of AD. In this study, the first hypothesis is that genetic variations might affect morphology-based brain networks, leading to functional deficits; the second hypothesis is that protein-protein interaction (PPI) between the candidate proteins and known interacting proteins to AD might exist and influence AD. 600 470 variants and structural magnetic resonance imaging scans from 175 AD patients and 214 healthy controls were obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative-1 database. A co-sparse reduced-rank regression model was fit to study the relationship between non-synonymous mutations and morphology-based brain networks. After that, PPIs between selected genes and BACE1, an enzyme that was known to be related to AD, are explored by using molecular dynamics (MD) simulation and co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) experiments. Eight genes affecting morphology-based brain networks were identified. The results of MD simulation showed that the PPI between TGM4 and BACE1 was the strongest among them and its interaction was verified by Co-IP. Hence, gene variations influence morphology-based brain networks in AD, leading to functional deficits.

Moreover, we uncovered novel characteristics of the KYCCSRK peptide, including its efficacy in reducing DYRK1A (triplicated in DS) and BACE1 protein levels, which resulted in reduced AD-like neuropathology in Ts2Cje mice. Finally, the peptide elicited neuroprotective effects by ameliorating synaptic plasticity mechanisms that are altered in DS due to the imbalance between inhibitory vs. excitatory currents.

We constructed APP- and tau-transgenic AD mice with deletion of IKKβ specifically in neurons, and observed that IKKβ deficiency reduced cerebral Aβ and p-tau, and modified inflammatory activation in both AD mice. However, neuronal deficiency of IKKβ decreased apoptosis and maintained synaptic proteins (e.g., PSD-95 and Munc18-1) in the brain and improved cognitive function only in APP-transgenic mice, but not in tau-transgenic mice. Additionally, IKKβ deficiency decreased BACE1 protein and activity in APP-transgenic mouse brain and cultured SH-SY5Y cells. IKKβ deficiency increased expression of PP2A catalytic subunit isoform A, an enzyme dephosphorylating cerebral p-tau, in the brain of tau-transgenic mice. Interestingly, deficiency of IKKβ in neurons enhanced autophagy as indicated by the increased ratio of LC3B-II/I in brains of both APP- and tau-transgenic mice. Thus, IKKβ deficiency in neurons ameliorates AD-associated pathology in APP- and tau-transgenic mice, perhaps by decreasing Aβ production, increasing p-tau dephosphorylation, and promoting autophagy-mediated degradation of BACE1 and p-tau aggregates in the brain. However, IKKβ deficiency differently protects neurons in APP- and tau-transgenic mice. Further studies are needed, particularly in the context of interaction between Aβ and p-tau, before IKKβ/NF-κB can be targeted for AD therapies.","1530-6860","FASEB journal : official publication of the Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology","(37) e22778",2023,"Laura","Schnöder","L","Department of Neurology, Saarland University, Homburg, Germany."

Therefore, this study examined the effect and possible mechanism of NTP in nerve injury caused by CCH. A rat CCH model was established by bilateral common carotid artery occlusion (2VO), and rats were treated with intragastric administration of NTP (200 nu/kg/day) for 28 consecutive days. After treatment, rats were subjected to the Morris water maze and novel object recognition test. Subsequently, an ELISA was applied to detect amyloid-β (Aβ) 1-40 and Aβ1-42 levels in rat hippocampal tissues, quantitative reverse transcription PCR assays were used to detect the mRNA expression levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and Trk B, and Western blots were used to detect the protein expression levels of BACE1, tau, p-tau, and protein kinase B (Akt)/glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) pathway-related proteins. The rat model of CCH was successfully established by 2VO. Behavioral tests indicated that the cognitive ability of 2VO rats was severely impaired. NTP treatment greatly ameliorated the cognitive disability, reduced Aβ1-40 and Aβ1-42 levels and tau phosphorylation, and upregulated BACE1, Trk B, and BDNF expression in the hippocampus of 2VO rats. Finally, we found that NTP markedly activated Akt/GSK3β pathway activity. NTP can ameliorate cognitive disability in CCH rats possibly by reducing Aβ accumulation and tau phosphorylation in the hippocampus. These effects of NTP may be related to the Akt/GSK3β pathway activation.

The present review hereby for the first time elaborately discusses the reported neuroprotective abilities of betanin and decodes the Nrf2 and SIRT1 modulating potential of betanin as a primary mechanism of action behind, hence highlighting it as a novel drug candidate for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases in the near future.","1573-7365","Metabolic brain disease","(38) 805-817",2023,"Banashree Chetia","Phukan","BC","Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology Laboratory, Department of Life Science and Bioinformatics, Assam University, Silchar, Assam, India, 788011."
36750595,"Mechanisms of amyloid-β34 generation indicate a pivotal role for BACE1 in amyloid homeostasis.","The beta‑site amyloid precursor protein (APP) cleaving enzyme (BACE1) was discovered due to its ""amyloidogenic"" activity which contributes to the production of amyloid-beta (Aβ) peptides. However, BACE1 also possesses an ""amyloidolytic"" activity, whereby it degrades longer Aβ peptides into a non‑toxic Aβ34 intermediate. Here, we examine conditions that shift the equilibrium between BACE1 amyloidogenic and amyloidolytic activities by altering BACE1/APP ratios. In Alzheimer disease brain tissue, we found an association between elevated levels of BACE1 and Aβ34. In mice, the deletion of one BACE1 gene copy reduced BACE1 amyloidolytic activity by ~ 50%. In cells, a stepwise increase of BACE1 but not APP expression promoted amyloidolytic cleavage resulting in dose-dependently increased Aβ34 levels. At the cellular level, a mislocalization of surplus BACE1 caused a reduction in Aβ34 levels. To align the role of γ-secretase in this pathway, we silenced Presenilin (PS) expression and identified PS2-γ-secretase as the main γ-secretase that generates Aβ40 and Aβ42 peptides serving as substrates for BACE1's amyloidolytic cleavage to generate Aβ34.","2045-2322","Scientific reports","(13) 2216",2023,"Irem","Ulku","I","Integrated Program in Neuroscience, McGill University, Montreal, QC, H3G 0B1, Canada."

Orexin has recently been linked to AD pathogenesis, and exogenous orexin-A (OXA) aggravates spatial memory impairment in APP/PS1 mice. However, the effects of OXA on other types of cognitive deficits, especially in 3xTg-AD mice exhibiting both plaque and tangle pathologies, have not been reported. Furthermore, the potential electrophysiological mechanism by which OXA affects cognitive deficits and the molecular mechanism by which OXA increases amyloid β (Aβ) levels are unknown. In the present study, the effects of OXA on cognitive functions, synaptic plasticity, Aβ levels, tau hyperphosphorylation, BACE1 and NEP expression, and circadian locomotor rhythm were evaluated. The results showed that OXA aggravated memory impairments and circadian rhythm disturbance, exacerbated hippocampal LTP depression, and increased Aβ and tau pathologies in 3xTg-AD mice by affecting BACE1 and NEP expression. These results indicated that OXA aggravates cognitive deficits and hippocampal synaptic plasticity impairment in 3xTg-AD mice by increasing Aβ production and decreasing Aβ clearance through disruption of the circadian rhythm and sleep-wake cycle.","1558-1497","Neurobiology of aging","(124) 71-84",2023,"Yi-Ying","Li","YY","Department of Physiology, Key Laboratory of Cellular Physiology, Ministry of Education; Key Laboratory of Cellular Physiology in Shanxi Province, Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, Shanxi, China."

Nevertheless, its chemical composition and pharmacological activities still lack in-depth research. The present study endeavored to analyze the possible phytochemical constituents in R. lhasaense and explore the main compound piceatannol-3'-O-β-D-glucopyranoside (PG) effect on cognitive impairment and its underlying mechanism. The chemical profile of R. lhasaense discovered 46 compounds, including 27 stilbenoids and 13 gallotannins using UPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS. The UPLC determined the contents of 6 main stilbenoids, among which the content of PG was the highest, up to 61.06 mg/g. Moreover, behavioral tests showed that PG (40 mg/kg and 160 mg/kg) administration markedly ameliorated memory impairments of scopolamine-induced mice. Biochemical parameters showed that PG treatment alleviated the levels of Ach, AchE, and inflammatory factors while elevating the levels of antioxidants in mice. In addition, network pharmacology was performed to reveal PG exert an mild cognitive impairment effect by participating in neurodegenerative disease pathways, proliferation and apoptosis-, and inflammation-related pathways. Eventually, the results of molecular docking and the qRT-PCR revealed that PG down-regulated the mRNA expressions of MMP3, MMP9 and BACE1 in cognitive impairment mice brain tissue. In conclusion, our results demonstrated that PG mitigated scopolamine-induced cognitive dysfunction in mice by targeting the BACE1-MMP3/9 pathway, and PG might be a promising mild AD drug candidate.","1950-6007","Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie","(160) 114394",2023,"Yue","Wang","Y","Key Laboratory of Bioactive Substances and Resources Utilization of Chinese Herbal Medicine, Institute of Medicinal Plant Development, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, Peking Union Medical College, Beijing 100193, China."

An APP segment is firstly immobilized on aminated microplate reactor. Cytosine (C) rich sequence-templated AgNPs/Zr-based metal-organic framework (MOF) composite is modified by phenol groups, and then the prepared tag (ph-AgNPs@MOF) is captured in microplate surface by the conjugation reaction of phenolic groups between tyrosine and tag. After cleavage by BACE1, the solution containing ph-AgNPs@MOF tags is transferred to the screen-printed graphene electrode (SPGE) surface for voltammetric detection of AgNP signal. This sensitive detection for BACE1 provided an excellent linear relationship between 1 to 200 pM with a detection limit of 0.8 pM. Furthermore, this electrochemical assay is successfully applied for screening of BACE1 inhibitors.

Our previous studies have found that quercetin and in its glycoside form, rutin, can modulate the proteasome function in neuroblastoma cells. We aimed to explore the effects of quercetin and rutin on intracellular redox homeostasis of the brain (reduced glutathione/oxidized glutathione, GSH/GSSG), its correlation with β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) activity, and amyloid precursor protein (APP) expression in transgenic TgAPP mice (bearing human Swedish mutation APP transgene, APPswe). On the basis that BACE1 protein and APP processing are regulated by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and that supplementation with GSH protects neurons from proteasome inhibition, we investigated whether a diet containing quercetin or rutin (30 mg/kg/day, 4 weeks) diminishes several early signs of AD. Genotyping analyses of animals were carried out by PCR. In order to determine intracellular redox homeostasis, spectrofluorometric methods were adopted to quantify GSH and GSSG levels using o-phthalaldehyde and the GSH/GSSG ratio was ascertained. Levels of TBARS were determined as a marker of lipid peroxidation. Enzyme activities of SOD, CAT, GR, and GPx were determined in the cortex and hippocampus. ΒACE1 activity was measured by a secretase-specific substrate conjugated to two reporter molecules (EDANS and DABCYL). Gene expression of the main antioxidant enzymes: APP, BACE1, a Disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 10 (ADAM10), caspase-3, caspase-6, and inflammatory cytokines were determined by RT-PCR. First, overexpression of APPswe in TgAPP mice decreased GSH/GSSG ratio, increased malonaldehyde (MDA) levels, and, overall, decreased the main antioxidant enzyme activities in comparison to wild-type (WT) mice. Treatment of TgAPP mice with quercetin or rutin increased GSH/GSSG, diminished MDA levels, and favored the enzyme antioxidant capacity, particularly with rutin. Secondly, both APP expression and BACE1 activity were diminished with quercetin or rutin in TgAPP mice. Regarding ADAM10, it tended to increase in TgAPP mice with rutin treatment. As for caspase-3 expression, TgAPP displayed an increase which was the opposite with rutin. Finally, the increase in expression of the inflammatory markers IL-1β and IFN-γ in TgAPP mice was lowered by both quercetin and rutin.

To study these different biological elements, we activated the basal forebrain in 5xFAD Alzheimer's model mice and littermates. Mice received 5 months of 1 h per day intermittent stimulation of the basal forebrain, which includes cholinergic projections to the cortical mantle. Then, mice were behaviorally tested followed by tissue analysis. The 5xFAD mice performed worse in water-maze testing than littermates. Stimulated groups learned the water maze better than unstimulated groups. Stimulated groups had 2-3-fold increases in frontal cortex immunoblot measures of the neurotrophin receptors for nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and a more than 50% decrease in the expression of amyloid cleavage enzyme BACE1. Stimulation also led to lower Aβ42 in 5xFAD mice. These data support a causal relationship between basal forebrain activation and both neurotrophin activation and reduced Aβ42 generation and accumulation.

Firstly, we extracted human scRNA sequencing datasets from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and identified differentially expressed genes within microglia after cell annotation.

Next, we utilized DIAMOnD and Flow Centrality algorithms to identify microglia modules and mediating pathways connecting these two diseases based on global network topology. Among these candidate pathways, the mediating genes FURIN and BACE1 (from SPIKN5 to CSNK1A1) were not only related to the formation of amyloid beta plaques that accumulate in the brain of AD patients, but also involved in cancer biology. Furthermore, the biological explorations of mediating pathways connecting AD and GBM modules reveal inflammatory response, lipid metabolism disorder, and cell proliferation terms. Finally, novel signatures for early AD detection as well as risk models for glioma prognosis were identified based on mediating genes involved in these pathways.

The most potent variant, TXB4, showed a 3.6-fold improvement over TXB2, which had on average 14-fold higher brain levels when compared to an isotype control. Like TXB2, TXB4 retained brain specificity with parenchymal penetration and no accumulation in other organs. When fused with a neurotensin (NT) payload, it led to a rapid drop in body temperature upon transport across the BBB. We also showed that fusion of TXB4 to four therapeutic antibodies (anti-CD20, anti-EGFRvIII, anti-PD-L1 and anti-BACE1) improved their brain exposure between 14- to 30-fold. In summary, we enhanced the potency of parental TXB2 brain shuttle and gained a critical mechanistic understanding of brain delivery mediated by the VNAR anti-TfR1 antibody.","1999-4923","Pharmaceutics","739",2023,"Pawel","Stocki","P","Ossianix, Inc., Stevenage Bioscience Catalyst, Gunnels Wood Rd., Stevenage SG1 2FX, UK."

LncRNA SNHG14 is abnormally expressed in numerous diseases. This research aimed to enucleate the lncRNA SNHG14 role in obesity. Adipocytes were treated with free fatty acid (FFA) to establish an in vitro model for obesity. Mice were fed a high-fat diet to construct an in vivo model. Gene levels were determined using quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR). The protein level was checked by western blot. The lncRNA SNHG14 role in obesity was assessed using western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The mechanism was estimated by Starbase, dual-luciferase reporter gene assay, and RNA pull-down. LncRNA SNHG14 function in obesity was estimated using mouse xenograft models, RT-PCR, western blot, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. LncRNA SNHG14 and BACE1 levels were increased, but the miR-497a-5p level was decreased in FFA-induced adipocytes. Interference with lncRNA SNHG14 reduced endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related molecules GRP78 and CHOP expressions in FFA-induced adipocytes, and decreased IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α expressions, indicating that lncRNA SNHG14 knockdown mitigated FFA-induced ER stress and inflammation in adipocytes. Mechanistically, lncRNA SNHG14 combined with miR-497a-5p, and miR-497a-5p targeted BACE1. Meanwhile, lncRNA SNHG14 knockdown reduced levels of GRP78, CHOP, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α, while cotransfection with anti-miR-497a-5p or pcDNA-BACE1 abolished these trends. Rescue assays illustrated that lncRNA SNHG14 knockdown relieved FFA-induced adipocyte ER stress and inflammation through miR-497a-5p/BACE1. Meanwhile, lncRNA SNHG14 knockdown restrained adipose inflammation and ER stress caused by obesity in vivo. LncRNA SNHG14 mediated obesity-induced adipose inflammation and ER stress through miR-497a-5p/BACE1.","1099-0461","Journal of biochemical and molecular toxicology","(37) e23343",2023,"YuBo","Han","Y","The First Department of Cardiovascular, First Affiliated Hospital, Heilongjiang University of Chinese Medicine, Xiangfang District, Harbin, China."

Because women have a higher prevalence of AD than men, sex differences are of great interest. Using cross-sectional and longitudinal data, we showed sex-dependent metabolic dysregulations in the brains of AD patients. Cohort 1 (South Korean, n = 181) underwent Pittsburgh compound B-PET, fluorodeoxyglucose-PET, magnetic resonance imaging, and blood biomarker (plasma tau and beta-amyloid 42 and 40) measurements at baseline and two-year follow-ups. Transcriptome analysis of data from Cohorts 2 and 3 (European, n = 78; Singaporean, n = 18) revealed sex differences in AD-related alterations in brain metabolism. In women (but not in men), all imaging indicators displayed consistent correlation curves with AD progression. At the two-year follow-up, clear brain metabolic impairment was revealed only in women, and the plasma beta-amyloid 42/40 ratio was a possible biomarker for brain metabolism in women. Furthermore, our transcriptome analysis revealed sex differences in transcriptomes and metabolism in the brains of AD patients as well as a molecular network of 25 female-specific glucose metabolic genes (FGGs). We discovered four key-attractor FGG genes (ALDOA, ENO2, PRKACB, and PPP2R5D) that were associated with amyloid/tau-related genes (APP, MAPT, BACE1, and BACE2).

The molecular pathways underlying PSCID are poorly defined but may overlap with neurodegenerative pathophysiology. Specifically, synaptic dysfunction after stroke may be directly mediated by alterations in the levels of amyloid beta (Aβ), the peptide that accumulates in the brains of Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. In this study, we use the transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) model in young adult mice to evaluate if a large vessel stroke increases brain soluble Aβ levels. We show that soluble Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels are increased in the ipsilateral hippocampus in MCAo mice 7 days after the injury. We also analyze the level and activity of β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), an enzyme that generates Aβ in the brain, and observe that BACE1 activity is increased in the ipsilateral hippocampus of the MCAo mice. Finally, we highlight that treatment of MCAo mice with a BACE1 inhibitor during the recovery period rescues stroke-induced deficits in hippocampal synaptic plasticity. These findings support a molecular pathway linking ischemia to alterations in BACE1-mediated production of Aβ, and encourage future studies that evaluate whether targeting BACE1 activity improves the cognitive deficits seen with PSCID.","1559-7016","Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism","(43) 66-77",2023,"Jacob M","Basak","JM","Department of Anesthesiology, University of Colorado Anschutz School of Medicine, Aurora, Colorado, USA."

While a handful of pharmaceuticals are approved to treat Alzheimer's, none has been shown to prevent, significantly slow or stop the disease. As a result, many see the appeal of alternative plant-based treatments as an option. Here, we show that many phytochemicals proposed or used as Alzheimer's treatments share a common theme: they work via a calmodulin-mediated mode of action. Some phytochemicals bind to and inhibit calmodulin directly while others bind to and regulate calmodulin-binding proteins, including Aβ monomers and BACE1. Phytochemical binding to Aβ monomers can prevent the formation of Aβ oligomers. A limited number of phytochemicals are also known to stimulate calmodulin gene expression.

ADP-ribosylation factor-like protein 6-interacting protein 1 (ARL6IP1) was then found to mediate the effect of CNP on BACE1 translation, amyloidogenesis, glial activation, and cognitive function. Through analysis of the 5'UTR-targetd RNA-binding proteins by RNA pulldown combined with LC-MS/MS, we found that FMR1 autosomal homolog 1 (FXR1) interacted with ARL6IP1 and mediated CNP-induced reduction of BACE1 by regulating the 5'UTR activity. Without altering the protein levels of ARL6IP1 and FXR1, CNP treatment promoted ARL6IP1 interaction with FXR1 and inhibited FXR1 binding to the 5'UTR both in vitro and in vivo. Collectively, CNP exhibited a therapeutic potential for AD via ARL6IP1.

Although studies on PCa have dealt with genetics, genomics, and the environmental influence in the causality of PCa, not many studies employing the Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) approaches of PCa have been carried out. In our previous study, we identified some causal genes and mutations specific to Indian PCa using Whole Exome Sequencing (WES). In the recent past, with the help of different cancer consortiums such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC), along with differentially expressed genes (DEGs), many cancer-associated novel non-coding RNAs have been identified as biomarkers. In this work, we attempt to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) including long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) associated with signature pathways from an Indian PCa cohort using the RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) approach. From a cohort of 60, we screened six patients who underwent prostatectomy; we performed whole transcriptome shotgun sequencing (WTSS)/RNA-sequencing to decipher the DEGs. We further normalized the read counts using fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM) and analyzed the DEGs using a cohort of downstream regulatory tools, viz., GeneMANIA, Stringdb, Cytoscape-Cytohubba, and cbioportal, to map the inherent signatures associated with PCa. By comparing the RNA-seq data obtained from the pairs of normal and PCa tissue samples using our benchmarked in-house cuffdiff pipeline, we observed some important genes specific to PCa, such as STEAP2, APP, PMEPA1, PABPC1, NFE2L2, and HN1L, and some other important genes known to be involved in different cancer pathways, such as COL6A1, DOK5, STX6, BCAS1, BACE1, BACE2, LMOD1, SNX9, CTNND1, etc. We also identified a few novel lncRNAs such as LINC01440, SOX2OT, ENSG00000232855, ENSG00000287903, and ENST00000647843.1 that need to be characterized further. In comparison with publicly available datasets, we have identified characteristic DEGs and novel lncRNAs implicated in signature PCa pathways in an Indian PCa cohort which perhaps have not been reported.

DDX17 knockdown, as opposed to DDX17 overexpression, markedly reduced the protein levels of BACE1 and the β-amyloid peptide (Aβ) in Y5Y-APP cells. We further found that DDX17-mediated enhancement of BACE1 was selectively attenuated by translation inhibitors. Specifically, DDX17 selectively interacted with the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) of BACE1 mRNA, and deletion of the 5'UTR abolished the effect of DDX17 on luciferase activity or protein level of BACE1. Here, we show that the enhanced expression of DDX17 in AD was associated with amyloidogenesis; through the 5'UTR-dependent BACE1 translation, DDX17 might serve as an important mediator contributing to the progression of AD.","2076-3425","Brain sciences","745",2023,"Yue","Liu","Y","Department of Neurology, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Chongqing Key Laboratory of Neurology, 1 Youyi Road, Chongqing 400016, China."

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been shown to play a role in synaptic plasticity, but their role in cognitive impairment in MS has not been fully explored. In this study, using quantitative real-time PCR, we examined the relative expression of two specific lncRNAs, BACE1-AS and BC200, in the serum of two cohorts of MS patients with and without cognitive impairment. Both lncRNAs were overexpressed in both cognitively impaired and non-cognitively impaired MS patients, with consistently higher levels in the cohort with cognitive impairment. We also found a strong positive correlation between the expression levels of these two lncRNAs. Notably, BACE1-AS was consistently higher in the remitting cases of both relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and secondary progressive MS (SPMS) groups than in the respective relapse cases of the same subtype, with the SPMS-Remitting group of cognitively impaired MS patients showing the highest expression of BACE1-AS among all MS groups. Additionally, we observed that the primary progressive MS (PPMS) group had the highest expression of BC200 in both cohorts of MS. Furthermore, we developed a model called Neuro_Lnc-2, which showed better diagnostic performance than either BACE1-AS or BC200 alone in predicting MS. Our findings suggest that these two lncRNAs may have a significant impact on the pathogenesis of the progressive types of MS and on the cognitive function of the patients.

The other two groups of mice received 0.9% saline and SCOP (1 mg/Kg) respectively. After memory related behavioral analysis the brain homogenates were evaluated for the antioxidant potential of ZOMEC and multiple protein markers were examined through western blotting. Our results provide enough evidences that ZOMEC decrease oxidative stress by increasing catalase (CAT) and glutathione S transferase (GST) and decreasing the lipid peroxidation (LPO). The SIRT1 and pre and post synaptic marker proteins, synaptophysin (SYP) as well as post synaptic density protein (PSD-95) expression were also enhanced upon ZOMEC treatment. Furthermore, memory impairment was rescued and ZOMEC appreciably abrogated the Aβ accumulation, BACE1 expression C and the p-JNK pathway. The inflammatory protein markers, NF-kβ and IL-1β in ZOMEC treated mice were also comparable with control group.

37269953,"Identification of small molecules and related targets that modulate tau pathology in a seeded primary neuron model.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the presence of tau protein inclusions and amyloid beta (Aβ) plaques in the brain, with Aβ peptides generated by cleavage of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by BACE1 and γ-secretase. We previously described a primary rat neuron assay in which tau inclusions form from endogenous rat tau after seeding cells with insoluble tau isolated from the human AD brain. Here, we used this assay to screen an annotated library of ∼8700 biologically active small molecules for their ability to reduce immuno-stained neuronal tau inclusions. Compounds causing ≥30% inhibition of tau aggregates with <25% loss of DAPI-positive cell nuclei underwent further confirmation testing and assessment of neurotoxicity, and non-neurotoxic hits were subsequently analyzed for inhibitory activity in an orthogonal ELISA that quantified multimeric rat tau species. Of the 173 compounds meeting all criteria, a subset of 55 inhibitors underwent concentration-response testing and 46 elicited a concentration-dependent reduction of neuronal tau inclusions that were distinct from measures of toxicity. Among the confirmed inhibitors of tau pathology were BACE1 inhibitors, several of which, along with γ-secretase inhibitors/modulators, caused a concentration-dependent lowering of neuronal tau inclusions and a reduction of insoluble tau by immunoblotting, although they did not decrease soluble phosphorylated tau species. In conclusion, we have identified a diverse set of small molecules and related targets that reduce neuronal tau inclusions. Notably, these include BACE1 and γ-secretase inhibitors, suggesting that a cleavage product from a shared substrate, such as APP, might affect tau pathology.","1083-351X","The Journal of biological chemistry","(299) 104876",2023,"Garrett S","Gibbons","GS","Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA."
37286480,"BACE1 SUMOylation deregulates phosphorylation and ubiquitination in Alzheimer's disease pathology.","BACE1 is essential for the generation of amyloid-β (Aβ) that likely initiates the toxicity in Alzheimer's disease (AD). BACE1 activity is mainly regulated by post-translational modifications, but the relationship between these modifications is not fully characterized. Here, we studied the effects of BACE1 SUMOylation on its phosphorylation and ubiquitination. We demonstrate that SUMOylation of BACE1 inhibits its phosphorylation at S498 and its ubiquitination in vitro. Conversely, BACE1 phosphorylation at S498 suppresses its SUMOylation, which results in promoting BACE1 degradation in vitro. Furthermore, an increase in BACE1 SUMOylation is associated with the progression of AD pathology, while its phosphorylation and ubiquitination are decreased in an AD mouse model. Our findings suggest that BACE1 SUMOylation reciprocally influences its phosphorylation and competes against its ubiquitination, which might provide a new insight into the regulations of BACE1 activity and Aβ accumulation.","1471-4159","Journal of neurochemistry","(166) 318-327",2023,"Yanna","Zhao","Y","Institutes of Biomedical Sciences, School of Medicine, Jianghan University, Wuhan, China."
37300691,"MiR-107 Activates NF- κ B versus A β Analysis of the regulatory effect of 1-42 induced apoptosis in Alzheimer's disease cells.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the acute degenerative diseases of the brain that occurs in the central nervous system. This disease is caused by the abnormal deposition of insoluble plaques and peptide amyloid beta (Aβ), the formation of nodules, and synaptic disorder. The formation of these nodes disrupts the functioning of neural circuits and changes in behavioral response due to the activation of neurotransmitter receptors. Research in recent years has shown that microRNAs play an effective role in Alzheimer's disease and neurotransmitter factors. Recently, miR-107 is effective in the pathology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) through the regulation of NF-κB signaling pathway. Experiments conducted using the dual luciferase method and western blot analysis also showed that miR-107 in primary neurons affects neurotransmitter factors in Alzheimer's disease through the regulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway. The results showed that the reduction of miR-107 expression through the regulation of the NF-κB signaling pathway leads to the suppression of cell apoptosis in Alzheimer's patients. On the other hand, increasing the expression of miR-107 leads to increasing the breaking process of Amyloid precursor protein (APP). This factor increases the production of amyloid beta (Aβ) peptide plaques and increases the expression of the BACE1 gene, which ultimately leads to the induction of apoptosis and induction of Alzheimer's disease.","1165-158X","Cellular and molecular biology (Noisy-le-Grand, France)","(69) 28-32",2023,"Yihuai","Peng","Y","Department of Pharmacy, School of Medicine, Hunan Normal University, Changsha, Hunan410006, China. 297879918@qq.com."

We here find that the levels of ArhGAP11A, a Ras homology GTPase-activating protein, significantly increase in patients with AD and amyloid precursor protein (APP)/presenilin-1 (PS1) mice. Reducing the ArhGAP11A level in neurons not only inhibits Aβ generation by decreasing the expression of APP, PS1, and β-secretase (BACE1) through the RhoA/ROCK/Erk signaling pathway but also reduces Aβo neurotoxicity by decreasing the expressions of apoptosis-related p53 target genes. In APP/PS1 mice, specific reduction of the ArhGAP11A level in neurons significantly reduces Aβ production and plaque deposition and ameliorates neuronal damage, neuroinflammation, and cognitive deficits. Moreover, Aβos enhance ArhGAP11A expression in neurons by activating E2F1, which thus forms a deleterious cycle. Our results demonstrate that ArhGAP11A may be involved in AD pathogenesis and that decreasing ArhGAP11A expression may be a promising therapeutic strategy for AD treatment.","2211-1247","Cell reports","(42) 112624",2023,"Ya-Ru","Huang","YR","State Key Laboratory of Biochemical Engineering, Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100190, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing 100049, China."
37322288,"ABCA7-Associated Clinical Features and Molecular Mechanisms in Alzheimer's Disease.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common type of neurodegenerative disease and its pathogenesis is still unclear. Genetic factors are thought to account for a large proportion of the overall AD phenotypes. ATP-binding cassette transporter A7 (ABCA7) is one of the most important risk gene for AD. Multiple forms of ABCA7 variants significantly increase the risk of AD, such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms, premature termination codon variants, missense variants, variable number tandem repeat, mutations, and alternative splicing. AD patients with ABCA7 variants usually exhibit typical clinical and pathological features of traditional AD with a wide age of onset range. ABCA7 variants can alter ABCA7 protein expression levels and protein structure to affect protein functions such as abnormal lipid metabolism, amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing, and immune cell function. Specifically, ABCA7 deficiency can cause neuronal apoptosis by inducing endoplasmic reticulum stress through the PERK/eIF2α pathway. Second, ABCA7 deficiency can increase Aβ production by upregulating the SREBP2/BACE1 pathway and promoting APP endocytosis. In addition, the ability of microglia to phagocytose and degrade Aβ is destroyed by ABCA7 deficiency, leading to reduced clearance of Aβ. Finally, disturbance of lipid metabolism may also be an important method by which ABCA7 variants influence the incidence rate of AD. In the future, more attention should be given to different ABCA7 variants and ABCA7 targeted therapies for AD.","1559-1182","Molecular neurobiology","(60) 5548-5556",2023,"Xiao-Hang","Qian","XH","Department of Geriatrics, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, China."

Due to genetic and clinical overlaps between different types of dementia, whole-exome sequencing (WES) has emerged as an appropriate screening method for diagnostic testing and novel gene-finding approaches. We performed WES and C9orf72 repeat testing in 60 well-defined Austrian EOD patients. Seven patients (12%) carried likely disease-causing variants in monogenic genes, PSEN1, MAPT, APP, and GRN. Five patients (8%) were APOE4 homozygote carriers. Definite and possible risk variants were detected in the genes TREM2, SORL1, ABCA7 and TBK1. In an explorative approach, we cross-checked rare gene variants in our cohort with a curated neurodegeneration candidate gene list and identified DCTN1, MAPK8IP3, LRRK2, VPS13C and BACE1 as promising candidate genes. Conclusively, 12 cases (20%) carried variants relevant to patient counseling, comparable to previously reported studies, and can thus be considered genetically resolved. Reduced penetrance, oligogenic inheritance and not yet identified high-risk genes might explain the high number of unresolved cases. To address this issue, we provide complete genetic and phenotypic information (uploaded to the European Genome-phenome Archive), enabling other researchers to cross-check variants. Thereby, we hope to increase the chance of independently finding the same gene/variant-hit in other well-defined EOD patient cohorts, thus confirming new genetic risk variants or variant combinations.","1479-7364","Human genomics","(17) 55",2023,"Sara","Silvaieh","S","Department of Neurology, Medical University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria."

On the other hand, schizophrenia is a neuro-developmental disorder with an overtly active central nervous system pruning system resulting into abrupt connections with common symptoms including disorganised thoughts, hallucination and delusion. Nevertheless, the fronto-temporal anomaly presents itself as a common denominator for the two pathologies. There is even a strong presumption of increased risk of developing co-morbid dementia for schizophrenic individuals and psychosis for Alzheimer's disease patients, overall leading to a further deteriorated quality of life. However, convincing proofs of how these two disorders, although very distant from each other when considering their aetiology, develop coexisting symptoms is yet to be resolved. At the molecular level, the two primarily neuronal proteins β-amyloid precursor protein and neuregulin 1 have been considered in this relevant context, although the conclusions are for the moment only hypotheses. In order to propose a model for explaining the psychotic schizophrenia-like symptoms that sometimes accompany AD-associated dementia, this review projects out on the similar sensitivity shared by these two proteins regarding their metabolism by the β-site APP cleaving enzyme 1.","1872-9649","Ageing research reviews","(89) 101988",2023,"Bruno","Vincent","B","Institute of Molecular and Cellular Pharmacology, Laboratory of Excellence DistALZ, Université Côte d'Azur, INSERM, CNRS, Sophia-Antipolis, 06560 Valbonne, France.

Inhibition of these enzymes affords therapeutic option for managing NDDs such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). Although, Gongronema latifolium Benth (GL) has been widely documented in ethnopharmacological and scientific reports for the management of NDDs, there is paucity of information on its underlying mechanism and neurotherapeutic constituents. Herein, 152 previously reported Gongronema latifolium derived-phytochemicals (GLDP) were screened against hAChE, hBChE and hBACE-1 using molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, free energy of binding calculations and cluster analysis. The result of the computational analysis identified silymarin, alpha-amyrin and teraxeron with the highest binding energies (-12.3, -11.2, -10.5 Kcal/mol) for hAChE, hBChE and hBACE-1 respectively as compared with those of the reference inhibitors (-12.3, -9.8 and - 9.4 for donepezil, propidium and aminoquinoline compound respectively). These best docked phytochemicals were found to be orientated in the hydrophobic gorge where they interacted with the choline-binding pocket in the A-site and P-site of the cholinesterase and subsites S1, S3, S3' and flip (67-75) residues of the pocket of the BACE-1. The best docked phytochemicals complexed with the target proteins were stable in a 100 ns molecular dynamic simulation. The interactions with the catalytic residues were preserved during the simulation as observed from the MMGBSA decomposition and cluster analyses. The presence of these phytocompounds most notably silymarin, which demonstrated dual high binding tendencies to both cholinesterases, were identified as potential neurotherapeutics subject to further investigation.","1573-501X","Molecular diversity","10.1007/s11030-023-10658-y",2023,"Gideon Ampoma","Gyebi","GA","Department of Biochemistry, Faculty of Science and Technology, P.M.B 005, Karu, Nasarawa State, Nigeria. gideonagyebi@gmail.com."
37355492,"APP-BACE1 Interaction and Intracellular Localization Regulate Aβ Production in iPSC-Derived Cortical Neurons.","Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized pathologically by amyloid β (Aβ)-containing plaques. Generation of Aβ from amyloid precursor protein (APP) by two enzymes, β- and γ-secretase, has therefore been in the AD research spotlight for decades. Despite this, how the physical interaction of APP with the secretases influences APP processing is not fully understood. Herein, we compared two genetically identical human iPSC-derived neuronal cell types: low Aβ-secreting neuroprogenitor cells (NPCs) and high Aβ-secreting mature neurons, as models of low versus high Aβ production. We investigated levels of substrate, enzymes and products of APP amyloidogenic processing and correlated them with the proximity of APP to β- and γ-secretase in endo-lysosomal organelles. In mature neurons, increased colocalization of full-length APP with the β-secretase BACE1 correlated with increased β-cleavage product sAPPβ. Increased flAPP/BACE1 colocalization was mainly found in early endosomes. In the same way, increased colocalization of APP-derived C-terminal fragment (CTF) with presenilin-1 (PSEN1), the catalytic subunit of γ-secretase, was seen in neurons as compared to NPCs. Furthermore, most of the interaction of APP with BACE1 in low Aβ-secreting NPCs seemed to derive from CTF, the remaining APP part after BACE1 cleavage, indicating a possible novel product-enzyme inhibition. In conclusion, our results suggest that interaction of APP and APP cleavage products with their secretases can regulate Aβ production both positively and negatively. β- and γ-Secretases are difficult targets for AD treatment due to their ubiquitous nature and wide range of substrates. Therefore, targeting APP-secretase interactions could be a novel treatment strategy for AD. Colocalization of APP species with BACE1 in a novel model of low- versus high-Aβ secretion-Two genetically identical human iPSC-derived neuronal cell types: low Aβ-secreting neuroprogenitor cells (NPCs) and high Aβ secreting mature neurons, were compared. Increased full-length APP (flAPP)/BACE1 colocalization in early endosomes was seen in neurons, while APP-CTF/BACE1 colocalization was much higher than flAPP/BACE1 colocalization in NPCs, although the cellular location was not determined.","1573-6830","Cellular and molecular neurobiology","(43) 3653-3668",2023,"Sandra","Roselli","S","Institute of Neuroscience and Physiology, Department of Psychiatry and Neurochemistry, The Sahlgrenska Academy at the University of Gothenburg, Blå Stråket 15, Sahlgrenska Hospital, 405 30, Gothenburg, Sweden. sandra.roselli@gu.se."

Directly inhibiting the protein-protein interaction (PPI) between Keap1 and Nrf2 has been reported as an effective strategy for treating AD. Our group has validated this in an AD mouse model for the first time using the inhibitor 1,4-diaminonaphthalene NXPZ-2 with high concentrations. In the present study, we reported a new phosphodiester containing diaminonaphthalene compound, POZL, designed to target the PPI interface using a structure-based design strategy to combat oxidative stress in AD pathogenesis. Our crystallographic verification confirms that POZL shows potent Keap1-Nrf2 inhibition. Remarkably, POZL showed its high in vivo anti-AD efficacy at a much lower dosage compared to NXPZ-2 in the transgenic APP/PS1 AD mouse model. POZL treatment in the transgenic mice could effectively ameliorate learning and memory dysfunction by promoting the Nrf2 nuclear translocation. As a result, the oxidative stress and AD biomarker expression such as BACE1 and hyperphosphorylation of Tau were significantly reduced, and the synaptic function was recovered. HE and Nissl staining confirmed that POZL improved brain tissue pathological changes by enhancing neuron quantity and function. Furthermore, it was confirmed that POZL could effectively reverse Aβ-caused synaptic damage by activating Nrf2 in primary cultured cortical neurons.

Moreover, locomotor activity, spatially guided exploratory behavior, and object recognition were impaired. Simultaneously, fingolimod reversed alterations in the expressions of the cytokines, Bace1, Psen2, and Gsk3b that occurred in the brain, elevated S1pr3 mRNA levels, restored normal cognition-related behavior patterns, and exerted anxiolytic effects.

37444065,"Investigation of Potential Drug Targets for Cholesterol Regulation to Treat Alzheimer's Disease.","Despite extensive research and seven approved drugs, the complex interplay of genes, proteins, and pathways in Alzheimer's disease remains a challenge. This implies the intricacies of the mechanism for Alzheimer's disease, which involves the interaction of hundreds of genes, proteins, and pathways. While the major hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease are the accumulation of amyloid plaques and tau protein tangles, excessive accumulation of cholesterol is reportedly correlated with Alzheimer's disease patients. In this work, protein-protein interaction analysis was conducted based upon the genes from a clinical database to identify the top protein targets with most data-indicated involvement in Alzheimer's disease, which include ABCA1, CYP46A1, BACE1, TREM2, GSK3B, and SREBP2. The reactions and pathways associated with these genes were thoroughly studied for their roles in regulating brain cholesterol biosynthesis, amyloid beta accumulation, and tau protein tangle formation. Existing clinical trials for each protein target were also investigated. The research indicated that the inhibition of SREBP2, BACE1, or GSK3B is beneficial to reduce cholesterol and amyloid beta accumulation, while the activation of ABCA1, CYP46A1, or TREM2 has similar effects. In this study, Sterol Regulatory Element-Binding Protein 2 (SREBP2) emerged as the primary protein target. SREBP2 serves a pivotal role in maintaining cholesterol balance, acting as a transcription factor that controls the expression of several enzymes pivotal for cholesterol biosynthesis. Novel studies suggest that SREBP2 performs a multifaceted role in Alzheimer's disease. The hyperactivity of SREBP2 may lead to heightened cholesterol biosynthesis, which suggested association with the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Lowering SREBP2 levels in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model results in reduced production of amyloid-beta, a major contributor to Alzheimer's disease progression. Moreover, its thoroughly analyzed crystal structure allows for computer-aided screening of potential inhibitors; SREBP2 is thus selected as a prospective drug target. While more protein targets can be added onto the list in the future, this work provides an overview of key proteins involved in the regulation of brain cholesterol biosynthesis that may be further investigated for Alzheimer's disease intervention.","1660-4601","International journal of environmental research and public health","6217",2023,"Marina","Passero","M","Department of Chemical Engineering, Villanova University, Villanova, PA 19085, USA."

37452089,"BACE1 in PV interneuron tunes hippocampal CA1 local circuits and resets priming of fear memory extinction.","BACE1 is the rate-limiting enzyme for β-amyloid (Aβ) production and therefore is considered a prime drug target for treating Alzheimer's disease (AD). Nevertheless, the BACE1 inhibitors failed in clinical trials, even exhibiting cognitive worsening, implying that BACE1 may function in regulating cognition-relevant neural circuits. Here, we found that parvalbumin-positive inhibitory interneurons (PV INs) in hippocampal CA1 express BACE1 at a high level. We designed and developed a mouse strain with conditional knockout of BACE1 in PV neurons. The CA1 fast-spiking PV INs with BACE1 deletion exhibited an enhanced response of postsynaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors to local stimulation on CA1 oriens, with average intrinsic electrical properties and fidelity in synaptic integration. Intriguingly, the BACE1 deletion reorganized the CA1 recurrent inhibitory motif assembled by the heterogeneous pyramidal neurons (PNs) and the adjacent fast-spiking PV INs from the superficial to the deep layer. Moreover, the conditional BACE1 deletion impaired the AMPARs-mediated excitatory transmission of deep CA1 PNs. Further rescue experiments confirmed that these phenotypes require the enzymatic activity of BACE1. Above all, the BACE1 deletion resets the priming of the fear memory extinction. Our findings suggest a neuron-specific working model of BACE1 in regulating learning and memory circuits. The study may provide a potential path of targeting BACE1 and NMDAR together to circumvent cognitive worsening due to a single application of BACE1 inhibitor in AD patients.","1476-5578","Molecular psychiatry","10.1038/s41380-023-02176-y",2023,"Xuansheng","Xiao","X","Department of Physiology and Pathophysiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Capital Medical University, Beijing, 100069, China."

Glucocorticoid also contributes to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by increasing ER-mitochondria connectivity, in which amyloid β (Aβ) processing occurs rigorously because of its lipid raft-rich characteristics. However, the mechanism by which glucocorticoid enhances γ-secretase activity in the mitochondrial-associated membrane of ER (MAM) and subsequent accumulation of mitochondrial Aβ is unclear. In this study, we determined how glucocorticoid enhances Aβ production in MAM using SH-SY5Y cells and ICR mice. First, we observed that cortisol-induced Aβ accumulation in mitochondria preceded its extracellular apposition by enhancing γ-secretase activity, which was the result of increased presenilin 1 (PSEN1) localization in MAM. Screening data revealed that cortisol selectively downregulated the ER retrieval protein Rer1, which triggered its maturation and subsequent entry into the endocytic secretory pathway of PSEN1. Accordingly, overexpression of RER1 reversed the deleterious effects of mitochondrial Aβ on mitochondrial respiratory function and neuronal cell viability. Notably, we found that cortisol guided the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) to bind directly to the RER1 promoter, thus trans-repressing its expression. Inhibiting GR function reduced Aβ accumulation at mitochondria and improved the outcome of a spatial memory task in mice exposed to corticosterone. Taken together, glucocorticoid enhances PSEN1-mediated Aβ generation at MAM by downregulating Rer1, which is a potential target at early stages of AD pathogenesis.","2213-2317","Redox biology","(65) 102821",2023,"Gee Euhn","Choi","GE","Laboratory of Veterinary Biochemistry, College of Veterinary Medicine and Veterinary Medical Research Institute, Jeju National University, Jeju, 63243, South Korea; Interdisciplinary Graduate Program in Advanced Convergence Technology & Science, Jeju National University, Jeju, 63243, South Korea."

We now show that NCAM2 increases axonal levels of beta-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), a protease that regulates axonal guidance. In brains of NCAM2-deficient mice, BACE1 levels are reduced in hippocampal mossy fiber projections, and the infrapyramidal bundle of these projections is shortened. This abnormal axonal organization correlates with impaired short-term spatial memory and cognitive flexibility in NCAM2-deficient male and female mice. Self-grooming, rearing, digging and olfactory acuity are increased in NCAM2-deficient male mice, when compared with littermate wild-type mice of the same sex. NCAM2-deficient female mice also show increased self-grooming, but are reduced in rearing, and do not differ from female wild-type mice in olfactory acuity and digging behavior. Our results indicate that errors in axonal guidance and organization caused by impaired BACE1 function can underlie the manifestation of neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism as found in humans with deletions of the NCAM2 gene.","1460-2199","Cerebral cortex (New York, N.Y. : 1991)","(33) 10047-10065",2023,"Saroj","Sah","S","School of Biotechnology and Biomolecular Sciences, The University of New South Wales, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia."

Male albino eight-week-old mice were assigned into four groups: 1. the control group (saline-treated), 2. d-galactose-treated mice (100 mg/kg/day, intravenously) for eight weeks, 3. d-galactose-treated mice (100 mg/kg/day, intravenously for eight weeks) and 6-AF-treated mice (30 mg/kg/day, intravenously for the final four weeks), and 4. 6-AF-treated mice (30 mg/kg/day i.p. for four weeks).

Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the role of BACE1 in microglial phagocytosis and inflammatory features in ICH. Here, we demonstrated the unique advantages of targeting BACE1 in microglia using an autologous blood model and primary microglia hemoglobin stimulation. When BACE1 was inhibited early in ICH, fewer residual hematomas remained, consistent with an increase in genetic features that favor phagocytosis and anti-inflammation. In addition, inhibition of BACE1 enhanced the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines and substantially reduced the expression of proinflammatory genes, which was regulated by signal transduction and phosphorylation of activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). Further pharmacological inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation effectively blocked the proinflammatory and weak phagocytic phenotype of microglia due to BACE1 induction. In summary, BACE1 is the critical molecule regulating the inflammatory and phagocytic phenotypes of microglia after ICH, and targeted inhibition of the BACE1/STAT3 pathway is an important strategy for the future treatment of ICH-induced neurological injury.","1945-4589","Aging","(15) 7709-7726",2023,"Jianfeng","Zhuang","J","Department of Neurosurgery, Qilu Hospital, Shandong University, Jinan 250012, China."

APP/PS1 mice and the age-matched wild-type controls were subjected to 3 behavioral tests: open field, new object recognition, and Morris water maze. Expression of Aβ, APP, CTF, BACE1, IDE, NEP, and LRP1 proteins in the extracted hippocampal tissue was evaluated by Western blotting. The distribution and the quantity of amyloid plaques and the spread of microglia in the hippocampus were determined by immunofluorescence. The contents of Aβ40 and Aβ42 in the hippocampus were assayed and analyzed on Simoa HD-1 analyzer. The proteins interacting with Aβ in the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice were detected by co-immunoprecipitation. Curcumin significantly reduced motor hyperactivity in the open-field test, improved short-term recognition memory, spatial learning, and reference memory in APP/PS1 mice. In the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice, curcumin significantly diminished the elevated Aβ levels and inhibited microglia proliferation. At the same time, curcumin had no effect on Aβ production, extracellular enzymatic hydrolysis, and LRP1-mediated outward transport, but enhanced Aβ clearance by activation of the intracellular ubiquitin-proteasome system and related peripheral mechanisms. Thus, curcumin improves the learning and memory abilities of APP/PS1 mice and reduces the pathological accumulation of Aβ in the brain.","1573-8221","Bulletin of experimental biology and medicine","(175) 335-340",2023,"M J","Zhang","MJ","Guangzhou Vocational and Technical University of Science and Technology, Guang Zhou, Guang Dong, China. zmingjuan2007@126.com."

To date, all clinical trials involving the inhibition of BACE1 have been discontinued due to a lack of efficacy or undesirable side effects such as cognitive worsening. The latter could have been the result of the inhibition of BACE at the synapse where it is expressed in high amounts. We have previously shown that prolonged inhibition of BACE interferes with structural synaptic plasticity, most likely due to the diminished processing of the physiological BACE substrate Seizure protein 6 (Sez6) which is exclusively processed by BACE1 and is required for dendritic spine plasticity. Given that BACE1 has significant amino acid similarity with its homolog BACE2, the inhibition of BACE2 may cause some of the side effects, as most BACE inhibitors do not discriminate between the two. In this study, we used newly developed BACE inhibitors that have a different chemotype from previously developed inhibitors and a high selectivity for BACE1 over BACE2. By using longitudinal in vivo two-photon microscopy, we investigated the effect on dendritic spine dynamics of pyramidal layer V neurons in the somatosensory cortex in mice treated with highly selective BACE1 inhibitors.

This study aimed to investigate the neuroprotective effect of PPD attenuating NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated microglial pyroptosis in vascular dementia (VD) rats induced by bilateral common carotid artery ligation (2-VO). Male Sprague-Dawley rats (SPF, 150-180 g, n = 10/group) were randomly divided into PPD (20, 10, 5 mg/kg, subcutaneous injection once per day for 3 weeks), model, and vehicle-sham group. It was found that PPD significantly reversed 2-VO-induced cognitive impairment by decreasing escape latency and spontaneous alternation and increasing the number of crossing platforms, showing memory-improving effects. PPD improved the pathological morphology of brain tissue in VD rats. PPD significantly reduced the cerebral infarction area and the activation of microglia in the cortex and hippocampal DG, CA1, and CA3 area. Moreover, PPD could attenuate NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated microglial pyroptosis, inhibit the positive expression of NLRP3, decrease IL-1β, and IL-18 levels, and increase IL-10 levels in the brain cortex. PPD also significantly alleviated the neurotoxicity by decreasing the Aβ and p-Tau in hippocampal DG, CA1, and CA3 areas. In addition, the levels of NLRP3, ASC, and IL-1β in the cortex, APP, BACE1, and p-Tau in the hippocampus were significantly reduced by PPD. These results suggested that PPD hinders microglial activation to alleviate neuroinflammation of NLRP3 inflammasome and inhibits neurotoxicity of Aβ deposition and Tau phosphorylation in 2-VO-induced VD rats.","1872-7972","Neuroscience letters","(814) 137439",2023,"Xue","Wang","X","Pharmacy College, Henan University of Chinese Medicine, Zhengzhou 450046, China."

Previous clinical studies have shown that the cognitive improvement of iTBS could last several weeks after treatment. Nonetheless, it is largely uncertain how the long-term effects of iTBS treatment are sustained. To investigate whether iTBS has a long-term effect on AD-type pathologies, 6-month-old APP/PS1 mice are administrated with 30 consecutive days of iTBS treatment. After a 2-month interval, morphological alterations in the brain are examined by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence staining, while levels of associated proteins are assessed by Western blot at the age of 9 months. We find that iTBS treatment significantly diminishes Aβ burden in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice. Moreover, we observe that iTBS treatment inhibits the expression of BACE1 and elevates the level of IDE, suggesting that the reduction of Aβ load could be attributed to the inhibition of Aβ production and facilitation of Aβ degradation. Furthermore, iTBS treatment attenuates neuroinflammation, neuronal apoptosis, and synaptic loss in APP/PS1 mice. Collectively, these data indicate that 1 month of iTBS treatment ameliorates pathologies in the brain of AD mice for at least 2 months. We provide the novel evidence that iTBS may exert after-effects on AD-type pathologies via inhibition of Aβ production and facilitation of Aβ degradation.","1873-2747","Brain research bulletin","(202) 110735",2023,"Hao","Huang","H","Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Daping Hospital, Third Military Medical University, Chongqing 400042, China; Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, General Hospital of Southern Theatre Command of PLA, Guangzhou 510010, China."
37587672,"BACE2 beyond β-processing of APP, its neuroprotective role in cerebrovascular endothelium.","Several proteases are involved in the proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) generating the amyloidogenic Aβ peptide, which can act as the triggering pathological effector of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Among these proteases, the β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 2 (BACE2) is of particular interest because it was first proposed as an alternative β-secretase to its homolog BACE1; however, accumulating evidence suggests that BACE2 acts as a non-amyloidogenic α-secretase and exerts neuroprotective effects. In this issue of J Neurochem, Katusic et al. present an interesting article reporting that BACE2 plays a role in preservation of cerebral vascular endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) function, thus exerting protective functions. Their data support that the process is mediated by the large soluble non-amyloidogenic APP fragment sAPPα through the γ-aminobutyric acid type B receptor 1, which enhances the expression of a major transcription factor for eNOS gene expression in endothelial cells, the Krüppel-like factor 2. These protective functions of BACE2 contrast with the pathogenic role of BACE1 as a key player in the AD amyloidogenic pathway. Indeed, many efforts have been invested in BACE1 inhibitors as potential disease modifiers for AD. Unfortunately, the results in clinical trials have been disappointing. In this scenario, a better understanding of the functions of BACE2, as well as the selectivity of BACE1 inhibitors with respect to other β-secretases (mainly BACE2), is crucial for the development of new therapeutic agents. Furthermore, specific cellular targeting should also be considered to improve such therapies due to the diverse balance of secretases targeting APP and the complex cross-talk between them and the generated APP fragments.","1471-4159","Journal of neurochemistry","(166) 887-890",2023,"Javier","Sáez-Valero","J","Instituto de Neurociencias de Alicante, Universidad Miguel Hernández-CSIC, San Juan de Alicante, Alicante, Spain."

AD pathology has two major hallmarks, the amyloid beta (Aβ) peptides accumulation and tau hyperphosphorylation, alongside with several sub pathologies including neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, loss of neurogenesis and synaptic dysfunction. In recent years, extensive research pointed out several therapeutic targets which have shown promising effects on modifying the course of the disease in preclinical models of AD but with substantial failure when transposed to clinic trials, suggesting that modulating just an isolated feature of the pathology might not be sufficient to improve brain function and enhance cognition. In line with this, there is a growing consensus that an ideal disease modifying drug should address more than one feature of the pathology. Considering these evidence, β-secretase (BACE1), Glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK-3β) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) has emerged as interesting therapeutic targets. BACE1 is the rate-limiting step in the Aβ production, GSK-3β is considered the main kinase responsible for Tau hyperphosphorylation, and AChE play an important role in modulating memory formation and learning. However, the effects underlying the modulation of these enzymes are not limited by its primarily functions, showing interesting effects in a wide range of impaired events secondary to AD pathology. In this sense, this review will summarize the involvement of BACE1, GSK-3β and AChE on synaptic function, neuroplasticity, neuroinflammation and oxidative stress.

Nobiletin possesses several bioactivities such as anti-inflammation, antioxidation, and neuroprotection. Consequently, the study's aim was to inspect the possible neurotherapeutic impact of Nobiletin in damping AD through autophagy regulation. Mice were randomly assigned into: Group I which received DMSO, Groups II, III, and IV obtained STZ (3 mg/kg) intracerebroventricularly once with Nobiletin (50 mg/kg/day; i.p.) in Group III and Nobiletin with EX-527 (2 mg/kg, i.p.) in Group IV. Interestingly, Nobiletin ameliorated STZ-induced AD through enhancing the motor performance and repressing memory defects. Moreover, Nobiletin de-escalated hippocampal acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity and enhanced acetylcholine level while halting BACE1 and amyloid-β levels. Meanwhile, Nobiletin stimulated the autophagy process through activating the SIRT1/FoxO3a, LC3B-II, and ATG7 pathway. Additionally, Nobiletin inhibited Akt pathway and controlled the level of NF-κB and TNF-α. Nobiletin amended the oxidative stress through enhancing GSH and cutting down MDA levels. However, EX527, SIRT1 inhibitor, counteracted the neurotherapeutic effects of Nobiletin. Therefore, the present study provides a strong verification for the therapeutic influence of Nobiletin in AD.

In the current study, AGO (40 mg/kg/day, p.o., 7 days) successfully ameliorated the cognitive and learning disabilities caused by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in rats (250 μg/kg/day, i.p., 7 days). This positive impact was supported by improved histopathological findings and improved spatial memory as assessed using Morris water maze. AGO showed a strong ability to control BACE1 activity and to rein in the hippocampal amyloid beta (Aβ) deposition. Also, it improved neuronal survival, neuroplasticity, and neurogenesis by boosting BDNF levels and promoting its advantageous effects and by reinforcing the pTrkB expression. In addition, it upregulated the pre- and postsynaptic neuroplasticity biomarkers resembled in synapsin I, synaptophysin, and PSD-95. Furthermore, AGO showed a modulatory action on Sortilin-related receptor with A-type repeats (SorLA) pathway and adjusted autophagy.

37728805,"Identifying β-secretase 1 (BACE1) inhibitors from plant-based compounds: an approach targeting Alzheimer's therapeutics employing molecular docking and dynamics simulation.","β-secretase 1 (BACE1) is an enzyme that is involved in generating beta-amyloid peptides and is believed to have a significant role in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Therefore, BACE1 has gained attention as a potential therapeutic target for treating AD. Modern drug discovery studies are being conducted to identify potential inhibitors of BACE1, with the goal of reducing the production of beta-amyloid peptides and, thus, slowing the progression of AD. Here, we used a multistep virtual screening methodology to identify phytoconstituents from the IMPPAT library that could inhibit the activity of BACE1. Molecular docking was employed to select initial hits based on their binding affinity toward BACE1. Screening for PAINS patterns, ADMET and PASS properties, was then used to identify potential molecules for BACE1 inhibition. In the end, we discovered two natural compounds, Peiminine and 27-Deoxywithaferin A, which demonstrated a strong affinity, effectiveness, and specific interactions for the BACE1-active site. The elucidated molecules also displayed drug likeliness. A 200 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulation was conducted to investigate the interaction mechanism, complex stability, and conformational dynamics of BACE1 with Peiminine and 27-Deoxywithaferin A. The MD simulations demonstrated that BACE1 was stable during the simulation with Peiminine and 27-Deoxywithaferin A. Overall, the results suggested that Peiminine and 27-Deoxywithaferin A hold significant potential as scaffolds in drug development efforts targeting BACE1 for the purpose of treating AD.","1573-501X","Molecular diversity","10.1007/s11030-023-10726-3",2023,"Mohammed","Alrouji","M","Department of Medical Laboratories, College of Applied Medical Sciences, Shaqra University, 11961, Shaqra, Saudi Arabia."
37735227,"Stem cells-derived exosomes alleviate neurodegeneration and Alzheimer's pathogenesis by ameliorating neuroinflamation, and regulating the associated molecular pathways.","Amyloid beta (Aβ) aggregation and tau hyper phosphorylation (p-tau) are key molecular factors in Alzheimer's disease (AD). The abnormal formation and accumulation of Aβ and p-tau lead to the formation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) which ultimately leads to neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. β- and γ-secretases produce Aβ peptides via the amyloidogenic pathway, and several kinases are involved in tau phosphorylation. Exosomes, a recently developed method of intercellular communication, derived from neuronal stem cells (NSC-exos), are intriguing therapeutic options for AD. Exosomes have ability to cross the BBB hence highly recommended for brain related diseases and disorders. In the current study, we examined how NSC-exos could protect human neuroblastoma cells SH-SY5Y (ATCC CRL-2266). NSC-exos were derived from Human neural stem cells (ATCC-BYS012) by ultracentrifugation and the therapeutic effects of the NSC-exos were then investigated in vitro. NSC-exos controlled the associated molecular processes to drastically lower Aβ and p-tau. A dose dependent reduction in β- and γ-secretase, acetylcholinesterase, GSK3β, CDK5, and activated α-secretase activities was also seen. We further showed that BACE1, PSEN1, CDK5, and GSK-3β mRNA expression was suppressed and downregulated, while ADAM10 mRNA was increased. NSC- Exos downregulate NF-B/ERK/JNK-related signaling pathways in activated glial cells HMC3 (ATCC-CRL-3304) and reduce inflammatory mediators such iNOS, IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-6, which are associated with neuronal inflammation. The NSC-exos therapy ameliorated the neurodegeneration of human neuroblastoma cells SH-SY5Y by enhancing viability. Overall, these findings support that exosomes produced from stem cells can be a neuro-protective therapy to alleviate AD pathology.","2045-2322","Scientific reports","(13) 15731",2023,"Muhammad Imran","Khan","MI","Department of Biotechnology, Faculty of Biomedical and Life Sciences, Kohsar University, Murree, Pakistan."
37740616,"Neuroprotective effect of Kurarinone against corticosterone-induced cytotoxicity on rat hippocampal neurons by targeting BACE1 to activate P13K-AKT signaling - A potential treatment in insomnia disorder.","The hippocampus has been implicated in the pathogenesis of insomnia disorder (ID) and the purpose of this study was to investigate the neuroprotective mechanism of the natural flavone Kurarinone (Kur) on hippocampal neurotoxicity as a potential treatment of ID. The effect of Kur on hippocampal neuronal cell (HNC) viability and apoptosis were assessed by Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and flow cytometry, respectively. Then, the effect of Kur on β-site amyloid precursor protein-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (AKT) phosphorylation level were measured by Western blot. Further, SwissTargetPrediction analysis and molecular docking experiments were used to detect a potential target of Kur. Then, the p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA) model was established in vivo to further study the effect of BACE1 expression on Kur and HNC. As a result, HNC viability was only significantly decreased by 2 μM of Kur. Kur reversed the impacts of corticosterone upon inhibiting viability (0.25-1 μM), PI3K (0.5-1 μM)/AKT phosphorylation, and BDNF (1 μM) level, and enhancing the apoptosis (0.25-1 μM) and BACE1 expression (1 μM) in HNCs. BACE1 was a potential target of Kur. Notably, Kur (150 mg/kg) attenuated PCPA-induced upregulation of BACE1 expression in rat hippocampal tissues as ZRAS (0.8 g/kg). The effects of Kur (1 μM) on corticosterone-treated HNCs were reversed by BACE1 overexpression. Collectively, Kur downregulates BACE1 level to activate PI3K/AKT, thereby attenuating corticosterone-induced toxicity in HNCs, indicating that Kur possibly exerted a neuroprotective effect, which providing a new perspective for the treatment of insomnia disorders.","2052-1707","Pharmacology research & perspectives","(11) e01132",2023,"Guoqing","Wu","G","Department of Medicine, Tongde Hospital of Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou, China."

Unfortunately, there is very limited drug discovery for the effective management of AD, and the clinically approved drugs have limited efficacy. Consequently, there is an immediate demand for the development of new compounds that have the ability to act as multitarget-directed ligands (MTDLs). As major pathological targets of the disease, the current study aimed to investigate lead natural bioactive compounds including apigenin, epigallocatechin-3-gallate, berberine, curcumin, genistein, luteolin, quercetin, resveratrol for their inhibitory potentials against β-amyloid cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE1) and monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) enzymes. The study compounds were docked against the target enzymes (MAO-B and BACE1) using MOE software and subsequent molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) studies. The molecular docking analysis revealed that these phytochemicals (MTDLs) showed good interactions with the target enzymes as compared to the reference inhibitors. Among these eight phytocompounds, the epigallocatechin-3-gallate compound was an active inhibitor against both drug targets, with the highest docking scores and good interactions with the active residues of the enzymes. Furthermore, the docking result of the active one inhibitor in complex with the target enzymes (epigallocatechin-3-gallate/BACE1, epigallocatechin-3-gallate/MAO-B, reference/BACE1 and reference/MAO-B) were further validated by MDS. According to the findings of our study, epigallocatechin-3-gallate has the potential to be a candidate for use in the treatment of neurological illnesses like AD.

Medium-chain triglycerides (MCTs) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) positively improve brain glucose metabolism and decrease the expression of AD-related proteins. However, the effects of the combined intervention are unclear. The present study explored the effects of the supplementation of MCTs combined with DHA in improving brain glucose metabolism and decreasing AD-related protein expression levels in APP/PS1 mice. The mice were assigned into four dietary treatment groups: the control group, MCTs group, DHA group, and MCTs + DHA group. The corresponding diet of the respective groups was fed to mice from the age of 3 to 11 months. The results showed that the supplementation of MCTs combined with DHA could increase serum octanoic acid (C8:0), decanoic acid (C10:0), DHA, and β-hydroxybutyrate (β-HB) levels; improve glucose metabolism; and reduce nerve cell apoptosis in the brain. Moreover, it also aided with decreasing the expression levels of amyloid beta protein (Aβ), amyloid precursor protein (APP), β-site APP cleaving enzyme-1 (BACE1), and presenilin-1 (PS1) in the brain. Furthermore, the supplementation of MCTs + DHA was significantly more beneficial than that of MCTs or DHA alone. In conclusion, the supplementation of MCTs combined with DHA could improve energy metabolism in the brain of APP/PS1 mice, thus decreasing nerve cell apoptosis and inhibiting the expression of Aβ.","2072-6643","Nutrients","4244",2023,"Zehao","Wang","Z","Department of Nutrition and Food Science, School of Public Health, Tianjin Medical University, Tianjin 300070, China."

Aβ accumulation is found to increase by BIN1 knockdown in cortical neurons in late-onset AD, due to BACE1 accumulation at enlarged early endosomes. Two BIN1 mutants, KR and PL, were identified to exhibit Aβ accumulation. Furthermore, BIN1 deficiency by BIN1-related polymorphisms impairs the interaction with tau, thus elevating tau phosphorylation, altering synapse structure and tau function.

The combination of small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting β-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) and caspase-3 will provide an effective treatment option for Alzheimer's disease (AD). To overcome the multiple physiological barriers and improve the therapeutic efficacy of siRNAs, lesion-recognizing nanoparticles (NPs) are constructed in this study for the synergistic treatment of AD. The lesion-recognizing NPs contain rabies virus glycoprotein peptide-modified mesenchymal stem cell-derived exosomes as the shell and a reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive polymer loaded with siRNAs as the core. After intranasal administration, the lesion-recognizing NPs cross the nasal mucosa and migrate to the affected brain areas. Furthermore, the NPs recognize the target cells and fuse with the cell membranes of neurons. The cores of NPs directly enter into the cytoplasm and achieve the controlled release of siRNAs in a high-ROS environment to downregulate the level of BACE1 and caspase-3 to ameliorate neurologic injury. In addition, lesion-recognizing NPs can significantly reduce the number of reactive astrocytes. Lesion-recognizing NPs have a positive effect on regulating the phase of neurons and astrocytes, which results in better restoration of memory deficits in 3 × Tg-AD mice.

Different cell culture models and transgenic mice models devoid of APP processing or in particular the APP intracellular domain (AICD) reveal that AICD decreases Gal3st1/CST expression and subsequently sulfatide synthesis. In return, sulfatide supplementation decreases Aβ generation by reducing β-secretase (BACE1) and γ-secretase processing of APP. Increased BACE1 lysosomal degradation leads to reduced BACE1 protein level in endosomes. Reduced γ-secretase activity is caused by a direct effect on γ-secretase activity and reduced amounts of γ-secretase components in lipid rafts. Similar changes were observed by analyzing cells and mice brain samples deficient of arylsulfatase A responsible for sulfatide degradation or knocked down in Gal3st1/CST.

It has become clear that Aβ disrupt glutamatergic synaptic function, which can in turn lead to the characteristic cognitive deficits of SAD, but the actual pathways are still not well understood. This opinion article describes the pathogenic mechanisms underlying cerebral amyloidosis. These mechanisms are dependent on the amyloid precursor protein and concern the synthesis of Aβ peptides with competition between the non-amyloidogenic pathway and the amyloidogenic pathway (i.e. a competition between the ADAM10 and BACE1 enzymes), on the one hand, and the various processes of Aβ residue clearance, on the other hand. This clearance mobilizes both endopeptidases (NEP, and IDE) and removal transporters across the blood-brain barrier (LRP1, ABCB1, and RAGE). Lipidated ApoE also plays a major role in all processes. The disturbance of these pathways induces an accumulation of Aβ. The description of the mechanisms reveals two key molecules in particular: (i) free estradiol, which has genomic and non-genomic action, and (ii) free DHA as a preferential ligand of PPARα-RXRα and PPARɣ-RXRα heterodimers. DHA and free estradiol are also self-regulating, and act in synergy. When a certain level of chronic DHA and free estradiol deficiency is reached, a permanent imbalance is established in the central nervous system. The consequences of these deficits are revealed in particular by the presence of Aβ peptide deposits, as well as other markers of the etiology of SAD.","1872-6240","Brain research","(1823) 148681",2023,"Didier","Majou","D","ACTIA, 149, rue de Bercy, 75595 Paris Cedex 12, France.

We found STP not only increased apoptosis and tau hyperphosphorylation, but also significantly increased Aβ production, resulting in synaptic dysfunction and cognitive decline in mimic AD models by STP. GP was found to rescue apoptosis and cognitive impairments caused by STP treatment. Moreover, GP recovered the decreased synaptic proteins PSD95, Synaptophysin and GluR2, and blocked dendritic spine loss. Interestingly, GP decreased the STP induced tau hyperphosphorylation at different sites including S-199, S-202, T-205, T-231, S-262, S-396, and S-404, and at the same time decreased Aβ production through down-regulation of BACE1 and PS1. These effects in STP treated primary hippocampal neurons and rats were accompanied with a restoration of AKT/GSK-3β signaling axis with GP treatment, supporting that dysregulation of AKT/GSK-3β pathway might be involved in STP related AD pathogenesis. The results from our research proved that GP might be a potential candidate compound to reduce neuronal damage and prevent the cognitive decline in AD.","1945-4589","Aging","10.18632/aging.205295",2023,"Ling","Lei","L","School of Basic Medicine, Key Laboratory of Education Ministry/Hubei Province of China for Neurological Disorders, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430030, China."
